The Internet of Things (IoT) can be described asa smart network of devices that are interconnected and embedded with sensors and software used to collect data and exchange information. The IoT has a variety of application domains, including health care as one of its chief research area. Our project eliminates the traditional system of preserving patient's medical health literature by introducing a portable web server which stores and synchronizes all kinds of patient information (reports, findings, scans, prescriptions, medical history, etc.) thereby making the system go paperless and hassle free. Further, this paper demonstrates the various functionalities implemented inorder to devise portable medical records and discusses on the scope of the core idea in the near future revolutionizing the field of healthcare.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1144-5; POD:978-1-5090-1145-2","10.1109/CICN.2016.93","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8082685","EHR;IoT;challenges;health care;networks;portable devices;services","History;Hospitals;Medical diagnostic imaging;Servers;Software","Internet of Things;health care;hospitals;medical information systems","Internet of Things;IoT;health care;medical devices;medical file;medical history;portable Web server;portable medical records","","","","","","","","23-25 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol.

As our previous work, we have proposed an optimal QoS control scheme that employs a multiplexing layer for priority scheduling and a decomposable error control coding scheme for WBAN. However, a two-hop extension supported in IEEE Std. 802.15.6 has not been considered. In this paper, we apply the two-hop extension, and then packet error ratio (PER), the number of transmissions and energy efficiency of our proposed system and the standard scheme are evaluated in that case.

This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2015.2434773","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109892","Dynamic Buffering;Dynamic buffering;Energy-Efficiency;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);Medical Platforms;energy efficiency;medical platforms","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Heuristic algorithms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network reliability;medical computing;medical information systems;power aware computing","access points;adaptive energy management;adaptive power management;buffer backlog size;buffer stability;channel states;dynamic energy-efficient algorithm;energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading;in-hospital network architecture;medical Internet-of-Things devices;medical IoT platform;medical cloud devices;medical cloud storage;medical data distribution;network lifetime;polynomial-time algorithm;power allocation","","7","","28","","","20150518","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. In other words, the focus of this Blue Skies piece is to analyze the research challenges involved with developing a new class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are “resource and data aware”, and which are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data and data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models and data availability while executing – trading accuracy for execution time, etc.","","","10.1109/MCC.2018.1081070","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260823","cloud IoT;deep learning;distributed;holistic;osmosis","Biological system modeling;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data models;Distributed databases;Machine learning;Mobile communication","","","","","","","","","","November/December 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively.

The inter-networking of all of these devices known as “the internet of things (IoT)” is expected to have tens of billions of devices, mostly wireless, definitely incurring a coexistence or interference problem. The ubiquitous industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio band at 2.4GHz, in particular, one of the candidate band for IoT is heavily oversubscribed due to its unlicensed nature and could become all but unusable for priority systems in a densely populated area in the future at the present rate of growth of 2.4GHz transmitters and networks. In our study, the communications of the “last 100 meters” of an IoT network, i.e., from devices to an access point (AP) are considered. The interference suppression algorithms using the probability of false alarm PF<inf>A</inf> based methods, i.e., the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion and the localization algorithm based on double-thresholding (LAD) are applied to enhance the transmission bit error rate (BER) performances in various scenarios. Besides the traditional fixed threshold approach, an adaptive threshold approaches are proposed to enhance the performances in frequency selective fading channels. The simulation results show that the proposed methods excellently work even in an IoT network, which contains a large number of devices.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6477-9; POD:978-1-5090-6478-6; USB:978-1-5090-6476-2","10.1109/ICITEED.2017.8250435","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8250435","Adaptive threshold;Co-existing problem;Interference suppression methods;Neyman-Pearson criterion","Interference;Meters;Narrowband;Random variables;Rayleigh channels;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","","12-13 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system.

However, these current methods have significant limitations because the geographic areas of Zika-carrying mosquito infestation are not known in fine-grained detail and testing for these locations is difficult. However, through crowdsensing techniques there are ways to better identify and narrow location determination. Devices such as smartphones are very common among the majority of citizens, and these devices can collect a plethora of information.

Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from scratch upon any changes in the configuration. Retraining of these algorithms requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose an approach for automatic retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. Our multi-view learning approach can be used in both online and batch modes. By applying the autonomous multi-view learning in the batch mode, we achieve an accuracy of 83.7% in activity recognition which is an improvement of 9.3% due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node. In addition to gain the less computation advantage of incremental training, the online learning algorithm results in an accuracy of 82.2% in activity recognition.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2789890","National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247230","Computational Autonomy;Machine Learning;Optimization;Transfer Learning;Wearable Sensors","","","","","","","","","","20180105","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The need for power management in smart homes focuses on reducing electricity cost and avoiding the high peak demand problems. For reducing electricity cost, another source of power can be used. The most preferable primary power unit will be solar power due to its availability in nature. This paper prioritizes the operation of power units. The proposed system consists of a controller, a photovoltaic system with battery, smart electrical appliance and smart communication network. The main use of the controller is to schedule the power units which may be solar power, battery power and grid supply. The proposed system uses Battery Energy Storage and Management (BESM) algorithm, which helped to reduce electricity cost. The smart controller works on BESM algorithm which picks up power units according to demand. There will be energy conversion from DC to AC so to improve quality of power, Selective Harmonic Elimination(SHE) method.

In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6704-6; POD:978-1-5090-6705-3; USB:978-1-5090-6703-9","10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210833","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210833","Cloud e-Healthcare;Software-Defined Networking;Wireless Body Area Network","Conferences;IEC;IEC Standards;Noise measurement","","","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge is to allow these devices to communicate with cloud applications wherein the mismatch of communication protocols may occur. In this context, this research work presents an approach for connecting industrial Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) with the Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project cloud-based platform for publishing the factory shopfloor data. In this manner, the C2NET platform exploits data that is generated by industrial equipment for further actions, such as the optimization of production plans.

It is an active research area and has evolved tremendously in recent decades. The learning activities are commonly explored using patient cases. Among multiple medical education methodologies, Case-Based Learning (CBL) is considered as an effective methodology for small-group of medical students. Normally in CBL, the medical experts give the legacy fixed medical cases to students during their class for group discussions and their learning. In this practice, due to lack of beforehand practice or knowledge about that particular case, students hesitate to participate due to lack of confidence. Internet of Things (IoTs) is one of the well-known emerging technology and this hesitation can be dealt with creating real-world clinical cases using IoTs data and user-friendly environment for case-based learning. In this paper, an IoT-based CBL methodology is introduced, which records realworld patient data using IoTs, analyzes the imperative signs' data, creates the real-world clinical case for students practicing, and finally provides feedback to medical students. For case study purposes, our developed CBL tool is simulated on patient's data to realize the proposed methodology.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4032-2; POD:978-1-5090-4033-9; USB:978-1-5090-4031-5","10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190847","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190847","Internet of things;case-based learning;clinical case;medical education","Data visualization;Education;History;Internet of Things;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Tools","","","","","","","","","","18-20 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of IoT in Healthcare system brings high value for the elderly, victims of chronic disease and those who require constant supervision. But there are many security issues in such application. Moreover, the medical devices used in the IoT enabled Healthcare System are resource constrained devices. So, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for authenticating such resource constrained medical devices. New algorithm for secure authentication and key agreement of the medical devices is also presented.

IoT has made big contributions to data growth, requiring highly reliable data storage solutions. Storage area networks (SANs) are one of such solutions. To meet high reliability and availability requirements, SANs have to provide fault tolerance through redundancy to minimize or eliminate system downtime, thus preventing business discontinuity due to catastrophic events. Mesh is one of the common SAN topologies that have been applied to implement a fault tolerant SAN in practice. In this paper, failure behavior of a mesh SAN is modeled using a dynamic fault tree (DFT) in the case of perfect links, or a network graph in the case of imperfect links. Based on the constructed DFT or network graph model, reliability of the mesh SAN is evaluated using a binary decision diagram-based method. Results obtained from the case study can provide insights into the behavior of general mesh SAN systems, providing guidelines in the reliable design and operation of SANs.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2749375","10.13039/100000144 - U.S. National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8026027","Binary decision diagram (BDD);Internet of Things (IoT);dynamic fault tree (DFT);mesh topology;reliability;storage area network (SAN)","Computer network reliability;Decision making;Fault trees;Mesh networks;Reliability theory;Servers;Storage area networks;Topology","","","","","","","","","20170906","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since IoT devices use heterogeneous radios with different bandwidths (e.g., 20 MHz for WiFi and 2 MHz for ZigBee), traditional interference avoidance methods, such as time-division multiple access (TDMA) and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA), have very low spectrum utilization. This is because TDMA and CSMA allocate the packets at time domain, without considering the bandwidth difference of different IoT radios. To address this issue, we propose PMC, a novel communication system that enables parallel multi-protocol communication to heterogeneous IoT radios (i.e., WiFi and ZigBee) within a single WiFi channel. Our extensive evaluations show that PMC achieves the throughput of up to 121.02 kbit/s and 319.76 Mbit/s for parallel communication to ZigBee and WiFi, respectively.

WBANs not only bring us conveniences but also bring along the challenge of keeping data's confidentiality and preserving patients' privacy. In the past few years, several anonymous authentication (AA) schemes for WBANs were proposed to enhance security by protecting patients' identities and by encrypting medical data. However, many of these schemes are not secure enough. First, we review the most recent AA scheme for WBANs and point out that it is not secure for medical applications by proposing an impersonation attack. After that, we propose a new AA scheme for WBANs and prove that it is provably secure.

Although much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the m-Therapy framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2776150","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116606","SIoT-based mobile therapy.;gesture recognition sensors;range of motion;smart living;therapy","Biomedical monitoring;Medical treatment;Monitoring;Multimedia communication;Sensors;Servers;Streaming media","","","","","","","","","20171121","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to - ake appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4815-1; POD:978-1-5090-4816-8; USB:978-1-5090-4814-4","10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101902","Arrhythmia Neural-Net;Arrhythmia classification;Arrhythmia detection;ECG FHIR;ECG signal processing;GP Connect;HAPI FHIR;HL7;Healthcare monitoring;MITDB Physionet;SNOMED-CT FHIR;Wearable IoT","Adaptive filters;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Real-time systems","adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising","3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG classification;ECG event observations;ECG kits biopotential measurements;ECG monitoring;ECG waveforms;FHIR interoperability;MIT-BIH Physionet;MITDB arrhythmia database;SNOMED coding system;Savitzky-Golay filter;arrhythmia classification;electronic health records database;feature extraction method;healthcare interoperability;heart rate variability analysis;kNN classifiers;machine learning models;neural net fitting models;personalized health-care monitoring devices;personalized wearable systems;recursive least square adaptive filter;signal processing;wearable biomedical devices;wearable health monitoring devices","","","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been observed that the indoor path loss models proposed for western countries cannot be directly used in Indian scenarios due to variations in building materials utilized, floor plans, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a non-deterministic statistical indoor path loss model-Tata Indoor Path Loss Model (T-IPLM) which can be used for the 2.4-2.5 GHz, Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. To propose and validate, we have conducted several drive tests with different conditions such as busy office premise with obstacles, open office premise, corridor, canteen, and multistorey office locations, etc. We have also compared T-IPLM with popular path loss models such as ITU-R and Log-distance; T-IPLM matches closely with the drive test results as compared to other models.

When this IoT technology is combined with Augmented Reality (AR), it will provide end users with real time as well as real world information. One of the prime advantages of AR combining with IoT is the bridging of the gap between the real and digital worlds around us. The ease of downloading features and scope of dynamic usage which AR brings to the smart devices and is expected to bring to the IoT is beyond human imagination! The education sector is expected to gain significantly using these technologies. The goal of technology in education is to make, learning easier, faster and more engaging for the students and to equip the instructor with powerful tools to provide more relevant courseware to their students. With introducing AR in education, we shall be able to provide contextually aware, more relevant, engaging and interactive courseware to the students, which would keep them interested in subject. Also, through IoT, the physical devices can provide context that the AR ecosystem would use for contextually aware rendering of multimedia content. Medical education domain is expected to gain significantly using IOT and AR. It is also observed that the training in the areas of equipment maintenance could gain significantly by applying these technologies judiciously. For eg. The conventional software virtual lab solution does not provide a real feel of performing an experiment. However, using IOT and AR technology, a sensor enabled Hardware based real lab environment can be created for performing the volumetric analysis experiments in chemistry by using WATER instead of Chemicals. C-DAC has developed few AR products in education domain - AR Board, AR Book and AR Game. AR Board is a virtual writing board on which a user can write with a laser pointer. It uses projection based AR Technology by creating a virtual env- ronment for contextual information presentation, and facilitates real-time interaction with the content. AR Book is a standard book that has been instrumented with AR markers printed, which when scanned would show augmented, 3D interactive content, videos, audio and animations contextually, on a printed book, thus adding new dimensionality to it. AR Game is a game based learning mobile application that can be used by students for learning through playing, and for evaluating their knowledge.

This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data.

One strategy that has drawn significant research attention is a focus on remote health monitoring systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This concept can help decrease pressure on hospital systems and healthcare providers, reduce healthcare costs, and improve homecare especially for patients with chronic diseases and the elderly. This paper explores the use of IoT-based applications in medical field and proposes an IoT Tiered Architecture (IoTTA) towards an approach for transforming sensor data into real-time clinical feedback. This approach considers a range of aspects including sensing, sending, processing, storing, and mining and learning. Using this approach will help to develop useful and effective solutions for pursuing systems development in IoT healthcare applications.

"ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare","A. Walinjkar; J. Woods","Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering University of Essex Colchester, Essex","2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)","20171009","2017","","","1","8","A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered a- d relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5057-4; POD:978-1-5090-5058-1","10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057360","ECG classification;FHIR;GP Connect;HL7;MITDB;Physionet;Wearable IoT;arrhythmia Neural-Net;arrhythmia detection;preventive health-care;real-time ECG","Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Heart;Monitoring;Real-time systems","Web services;biomedical telemetry;cardiology;data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;health care;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;patient monitoring;pattern matching;real-time systems;signal classification;telemedicine","3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit;ECG abnormalities;ECG equipment;ECG readings;ECG waveforms;Electronic Health Record;abnormal ECG events;arrhythmia classification;cure institutions;health care;k-NN Classification models;machine learning phase;misclassification error value;modern wearable health monitoring devices;neuralnet fitting models;personalized healthcare;potential health hazards;prediction models;prediction tasks;real-time ECG Classification;real-time analyses;tele health analytical server;timely medical treatment;trained classification models;unique feature extraction method;wearable biomedical devices;wearable devices;wearable systems","","","","","","","","19-20 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Steenhaut","Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","IEEE Access","20171006","2017","5","","19536","19561","The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting every single object to the Internet with the purpose to automate every aspect of daily life. The IoT relies heavily on wireless low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) that collect information from the physical world and send the measurements to data aggregation and processing nodes. Most LLNs operate in the non-licensed industrial, scientific, and medical radio band, which is shared by a considerable number of systems. Coexisting wireless systems cause interference to each other, limiting their achievable performance. Multichannel communications enable frequency diversity, which in turn provides robustness against interference as well as increased network capacity. There is a considerable interest in multichannel medium access control (MAC) protocols for LLNs, including an evolving standard for the MAC layer of LLNs. In this paper, we review the latest advances in the topic and introduce a new classification framework for multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs. While our framework builds on previous review and classification studies, it adds aspects of a MAC protocol that reflect its interactions with the surrounding network stack. Seeing the resource constraints of the LLN devices, the study of such interactions-which is missing in prior classification efforts-can be the key for improving future designs. Relevant protocols published since 2006 are discussed and classified using the presented framework, including the recent multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs, such as the latest version of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for time slotted channel hopping.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2748178","10.13039/501100003130 - Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024074","Internet of Things;LLN;classification framework;multichannel MAC protocols","IEEE 802.15 Standard;Media Access Protocol;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;Zigbee;access protocols;pattern classification;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels","IEEE 802.15.4 standard;Internet of Things;IoT;LLN;MAC layer;MAC protocol;classification framework;classification studies;data aggregation;medical radio band;multichannel MAC protocol classification;multichannel communications;multichannel medium access control protocols;network capacity;network stack;nonlicensed industrial scientific and medical radio band;prior classification efforts-can;processing nodes;recent multichannel MAC;relevant protocols;time slotted channel hopping;wireless low-power lossy networks;wireless systems","","","","","","OAPA","20170901","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

No matter the zipper is totally closed, quarterly opened, half opened, or is even totally opened, the antenna can operate with acceptable performance, though the common status of the handbag zipper is closed. Thus, it is to some extent reconfigurable, especially for radiation patterns. A fractional bandwidth of 4.92% at 2.44 GHz of the industrial, scientific, and medical band with a gain of about 5 dBi has been achieved. The impact of the human body has been evaluated.

The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care especially for the respiratory diseases. However, when design such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency and etc to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data-acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different with the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps towards these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in the time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi. In order to satisfy the requirements of applications of personal medical care in WSNs and IoT, this study proposes an approximated <formula><tex>$l_0$</tex></formula> (AL0) norm based method to search the solution via the gradient descent method, then projects the searched solution to the reconstruction feasible set.

Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and access by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while prevent unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system which supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2017.2751640","AXA Research Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Research Foundation Singapore; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8036213","access control;break-glass;healthcare system;lightweight;secure IoT","Access control;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Cryptography;Hip;Informatics;Medical services","","","","","","","","","20170913","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them.

Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting.

Rangel De Sousa","","IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine","20170810","2017","20","4","49","54","Wireless power transfer (WPT) is an old subject, introduced for the first time by Nikola Tesla in the twentieth century [1]. His patent proposal was based on the magnetic resonance of two coils to distribute large amounts of energy to distant places of consumption. The subject returned to the mainstream in the last decade due to the exponential growth in the number of electronic devices. Currently, the main goal is to achieve ubiquity of WPT with the consolidation of the Internet of Things (IoT). How to supply the energy necessary to operate this huge network of gadgets is still a problem waiting for a solution. Three main aspects must be considered when outlining the powering strategy of those forthcoming technologies: small physical volume, high energy efficiency, and compatible aesthetics. Other emerging topics have similar requirements, such as battery-less medical implanted devices, remote contactless, and radio frequency identification (RFID), to mention a few. Current techniques envisaged for WPT are founded on the transmission of energy by electromagnetic fields. Both far- and near-field strategies have been studied; however, in this paper we focus on the latter, specifically on inductive power transfer (IPT). A typical IPT system can be thought of as an aircore transformer connected to a load and a source by passive networks. These networks provide the necessary impedance transformation for maximizing the power transfer from source to load. The key to achieving high transfer efficiency is to minimize the losses on the passives, including the transformer inductors. Moreover, the magnetic coupling factor between the inductances should be as high as possible. In this article, we review the modeling of a typical IPT link and discuss the criteria for maximizing the power transferred to the load as well as the power transfer efficiency. In addition, we report application-specific IPT designs and characterization which have been addressed by Brazilian- researchers.","1094-6969;10946969","","10.1109/MIM.2017.8006394","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8006394","","Capacitors;Inductors;Magnetic resonance;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless power transfer","Internet of Things;impedance convertors;inductive power transmission;inductors","IPT system;Internet of Things;IoT;WPT;aircore transformer;compatible aesthetics;contactless instrumentation;electromagnetic fields;electronic devices;energy efficiency;far-field strategies;impedance transformation;inductive power transfer;magnetic coupling factor;magnetic resonance;near-field strategies;physical volume;power transfer efficiency;transformer inductors;wireless power transfer","","","","","","","","August 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback.

In this paper, we are presenting concept of the Naked environment where patients can get health services from smart and intelligent surroundings of hospital without using explicit gadgets. Patients would have direct interaction with the environment and get identified through it.

In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements.

In addition to the increase of lifetime span of population, also the increase of health risks and their locomotive impairments increases, requiring a close monitoring and continuous evaluation. Such monitoring should be as non-invasive as possible, in order not to compromise the mobility and the day-to-day activities of citizens.

However, this has become a bottleneck in recent years since an extreme amount of heterogeneous items have to be recorded and traced with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. In a typical application of process synthesis management, each item will be involved with multiple processes but when those processes are interconnected, an extremely complex network emerges and has to be managed. Existing works on processing management systems, however, are always case-based and only focus on specific application domains. Thus, the general applied processing management model is rather limited. In this paper, we summarize the characteristics of the RFID application domains, and by abstraction, we propose an innovation of the RFID processing model. In this model, each RFID data were deemed as an operation record and all their processing services are logically interconnected and organized as a procedure graph. In addition, we abstract and summarize the basic RFID data processes into a few types. The advantage of this design is that the basic RFID data processing logic can be preprogrammed and in a real domain, the system can be dynamically programmed by automatically constructing the procedure graph nodes with those basic processes and mapping the interconnection logic according to the topology of the graph. As the last part of this paper, we designed a prototype system for medical instruments infection control to demonstrate our approach.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2661326","Central University Basic Research Funds Foundation of China; National Science and Technology Major Project of China; National Science and Technology Support Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836312","Data integrity validation;distributed query processing;process modeling theory;radio frequency identification (RFID)","Data models;Data processing;Instruments;Internet of Things;Logic gates;RFID tags","data communication;graph theory;radiofrequency identification","automatic RFID data processing service management;medical instruments;procedure graph;procedure graph model;process management;process synthesis management;radio frequency identification","","3","","","","","20170130","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT.

E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure threefactor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card, 2) password and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Burrows- Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic.

HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3716-2; POD:978-1-5090-3717-9","10.1109/ICCCSP.2017.7944086","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944086","Cardiovascular disease;Diabetic mellitus;Heart Rate Variability (HRV);Hypertension;Internet of Things (IoT);Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT);Transport Level Security (TLS);Zigbee","Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate variability;Hypertension;Monitoring;Servers;ZigBee","Internet of Things;Zigbee;biomedical telemetry;cardiology;diseases;electronic messaging;file servers;patient monitoring;protocols;telemedicine;wireless LAN","HRV analysis;HRV parameters;Internet of Things technology;IoT-based remote HRV monitoring system;MQTT protocol;WiFi technology;Wireless Zigbee-based pulse sensor;Zigbee technology;cardiovascular disease;diabetic mellitus;disease states;heart rate variability;hypertensive patients;short message service","","","","","","","","10-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara<sup>®</sup> RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions. While implications for an IoT system such as LoCATE are wide-ranging; its primary objective is to provide an easy to use, low-cost solution to track the location of medical assets in real-time.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1848-6; POD:978-1-5386-1849-3","10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937703","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937703","Cloud Computing;E-Health Care;Internet of Things (IoT);Localization","Cloud computing;Hospitals;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Transmitters;Wireless communication;Wireless fidelity","Internet of Things;Web services;cloud computing;diseases;health care;medical information systems;radiofrequency identification;wireless LAN","Amazon Web Services;Internet of Things;IoT technology;LoCATE system;Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment;RFID technology;Sentara RMH hospital;WiFi infrastructure;cloud computing platform;cloud storage platform;disease;health care system;medical asset location;medical system;mobile app;near-real time tracking tool;patient health data;radiofrequency identification;real-time location data;wireless technology","","1","","","","","","28-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different wireless and wired technologies link sensors and systems together, through wireless access points, gateways, and routers that in turn connect to the web and cloud-based intelligence. IoT architectures make great demands on network control methods for the efficient management of massive amounts of nodes and data. Therefore, some of the cloud's management tasks should be distributed around the edges of networked systems, utilizing fog computing to control and manage, e.g., network resources, quality, traffic prioritizations, and security. In this work, we present adaptive edge computing solutions based on regressive admission control (REAC) and fuzzy weighted queueing (FWQ) that monitor and react to network quality-of-service (QoS) changes within heterogeneous networks, and in a vehicular use case scenario utilizing IEEE 802.11p technology.

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups.

To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security.

In case of bio-medical, rescue-worker or military applications sensitive data are often transmitted, requiring the need for encryption. The distribution of symmetric encryption keys is often an issue leading to security risks. Body-worn sensor nodes are generally employed in quickly varying channel conditions due to body movement. The radio-communication channel between such nodes is however reciprocal, allowing the extraction of an array of similar channel measurements at both ends of the link. These data can be used to build equal encryption keys at both link ends without the need for actual over-the-air key distribution. This paper studies the practical performance of an enhanced channel-based key generation system with a very short round-trip delay, allowing reciprocal channel assessment with increased accuracy. Measurements were performed using the new system and the results of the enhanced key generation are evaluated. Although the performance is slightly increased thanks to the shorter round-trip delay, the accuracy of the signal level detector still imposes limits.","","Electronic:978-8-8907-0187-0; POD:978-1-5090-3742-1","10.23919/EuCAP.2017.7928251","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7928251","antenna;encryption;key generation;measurement;propagation;sensor nodes","Antenna measurements;Delays;Encryption;Error analysis;Measurement uncertainty;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","body sensor networks;channel estimation;cryptography;telecommunication security","Internet of Things;bio-medical;body-worn sensor nodes;channel assessment;channel estimation;channel-based key generation system;military;over-the-air key distribution;radiocommunication channel;rescue-worker;symmetric encryption keys","","","","","","","","19-24 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Internet of Things is a vision that entails connectivity among different physical and virtual objects in order to understand how the life would change when things, homes and cities become smart. In this sense, IoT is an integral part of the `future Internet' that counsels individuals, public and private organizations, research and educational institutes about how the `smart things' can be active participants in business, information and social processes by interacting with themselves and with the environment. Thus `smart things' are expected to exchange/process the sensed data, while reacting autonomously to the events with or without any human intervention and self configuring themselves. The application domain of IoT is spreading out over the time. To name a few, IoT would revolutionize fields such as telemedicine (or the future `medical tourism'), irrigation, smart buildings & industries, ecommerce, auto vehicle systems, monitoring & surveillance, etc. However, all these charismatic and pleasing aspects of IoT can be envisioned in reality only if a `well-defined' standard can be constituted that could deal with the complexity, size, security, privacy, time, cost, peaceful co-existence and better integration among the things/objects, and the socio-economic implications.

Things represent the physical objects which are provided with unique identification numbers and their purpose is to collect and transmit the data which are relevant to the scenario in which things are placed. From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification. In RFID system, proper authentication has to be performed between RFID tags and RFID reader.

Further, the applications of IoT in sensing the glucose level, ECG monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, wheelchair management, medication management and rehabilitation system are analyzed. The analysis results show that the use of IoT in the medical field increases the quality of life, user experience, patient outcomes and real-time disease management. The introduction of medical IoT is not without security challenges. Hence, the security threats such as confidentiality, authentication, privacy, access control, trust, and policy enforcement are analyzed. The presence of these threats affect the performance of IoT, thus, the cryptographic algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) are used. The investigation on these techniques proves that the RSA provides better security than the AES and DES algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1338-8; POD:978-1-5090-1339-5","10.1109/CAST.2016.7914983","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914983","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES);Data Encryption Standard (DES);Internet of Things (IoT);Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA);medical applications;medical services;security threats","Access control;Biomedical monitoring;Encryption;Medical services;Monitoring","Internet of Things;assisted living;authorisation;data privacy;health care;human factors;medical computing;mobile computing;public key cryptography;trusted computing","AAL;AES algorithm;DES algorithm;ECG monitoring;Internet of Things;Internet of m-health;IoT applications;RSA algorithm;Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm;advanced encryption standard algorithm;ambient assisted living;blood pressure monitoring;community healthcare;cryptographic algorithms;data authentication;data confidentiality;data encryption standard algorithm;data privacy;embedded gateway configuration;glucose level sensing;indirect emergency healthcare;medical services;medication management;patient outcomes;policy enforcement;quality of life;real-time disease management;rehabilitation system;security threats;trusting computing;user experience;wheelchair management","","1","","","","","","19-21 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Miniaturization is a new key requirement for the application in the internet of things and implantable medical devices. Realization of efficient RF power transfer using conventional techniques based on 900 MHz and 2.4GHz is difficult, mainly due to the relatively large wavelength in these bands. On the other hand, conventional inductive coupling is very inefficient as the device becomes very small, limited by the small coupling factor and operating frequency. In this paper, we utilize a multicoil transmitting (Tx) array to power up very small receiving (Rx) devices in the near field by boosting the power gain to a much higher level. The power gain boosting is achieved by operating the array close to its self-resonance frequency and optimizing the phase relationship of the array elements. To validate the proposed technique, we implemented a prototype printed circuit board (PCB) to power a 1 cm × 1 cm small Rx coil at a distance of 20 cm. To demonstrate the improvement on power gain, we designed a 3 × 3 Tx coil array composed of nine 3 cm × 3 cm elements, as well as an individual large Tx coil with the same dimension of the array for fair comparison. Measured results show that the transducer power gain can be increased by 16.4 dB with the proposed technique.","0885-8993;08858993","","10.1109/TPEL.2016.2626473","DARPA SHIELD program; 10.13039/100000185 - DARPA; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738583","Miniaturization;multicoil array;near-field;power gain;weakly-coupled;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Boosting;Couplings;Gain;Impedance;Mathematical model;Phased arrays;Transducers","inductive power transmission;transducers","Internet of Things application;RF power transfer;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency 900 MHz;gain boosting array technique;implantable medical device;multicoil transmitting array;near-field inductive coupling;printed circuit board prototype;transducer;very small receiving device;weakly-coupled wireless power transfer","","","","","","","20161108","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently, gait analysis is carried out in a motion laboratory that provides a full analysis of the motion body segments using a super highly accurate computer. This method is expensive and not affordable for everyone, indeed it requires quite a lot of maintenances. Furthermore, gait analysis requires a specialist to conduct and examine the patients, which means patients have to pay a lot of visits to hospital just only to get a treatment and feedback from the doctor that resulted waste of time, energy and money. Thus, this project will introduce a new and advance ways solution in order to evaluate the gait parameters. In this project, it will focus on two types of gait parameters, which is plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. One of the bend sensors is intended to be place under the sole and another one is around the ankle. The ultrasound sensor it will be assembled at the side of the shoe. The advantages of the completed system are when both of these sensors recorded all the gait information the subject or the patient still can do the daily routine life without interruption. The designed gait shoe is also able to display results from the analysis and sent it directly to the medical specialist through database to the data center analysis or online monitoring and at the same time the patient also can monitor via mobile phone.","","CD:978-1-5090-1177-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-1178-0; POD:978-1-5090-1179-7","10.1109/ICCSCE.2016.7893637","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7893637","Bend or Flex sensor;Dorsiflexion;Gait parameter;Internet of Things;Online monitoring;Plantar flexion","Androids;Foot;Footwear;Humanoid robots;Legged locomotion;Monitoring;Sensors","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;gait analysis;mobile computing;mobile handsets;wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth module;Intel Edison;Internet of Things;IoT;Minnow board;bend angle;bend sensors;continuous monitoring;daily routine life;data center analysis;database system;distance rate;dorsiflexion;gait analysis;gait information;gait measurement;gait shoe system;medical specialist;mobile application;mobile phone;motion body segments;motion laboratory;online monitoring;plantar flexion;ultrasound sensor;wireless sensors integration;wireless system","","","","","","","","25-27 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers","A. Alaiad; L.

Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-qu- lity expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2632822","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828160","Internet of things;smart home healthcare systems;usability;wireless-sensor network","Collaboration;Context modeling;Medical services;Predictive models;Smart homes;Technological innovation;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;health care;home computing;patient care;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Kvale approach;WSN-SHHS application;WSN-SHHS research;WSN-based smart home healthcare system;generic technology adoption model;home healthcare agency;home healthcare patient;human detachment;life-quality expectancy;patient-centered care;patients adoption;pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model;predictive power accounting;smart telecommunication technology;technology adoption theory;wireless sensor network","","1","","","","","20170120","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques.

This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions.

We propose an approach for automatic detection of physical sensor-contexts (e.g., on-body sensor location) without need for collecting new labeled training data. Our techniques enable system designers and end-users to share and reuse computational algorithms that are trained under different contexts and data collection settings. We develop a framework to autonomously identify sensor-context. We propose a gating function to automatically activate the most accurate computational algorithm among a set of shared expert models. Our analysis based on real data collected with human subjects while performing 12 physical activities demonstrate that the accuracy of our multi-view learning is only 7.9% less than the experimental upper bound for activity recognition using a dynamic sensor constantly migrating from one on-body location to another. We also compare our approach with several mixture-of-experts models and transfer learning techniques and demonstrate that our approach outperforms algorithms in both categories.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4466-1; POD:978-1-5090-3421-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7827652","","Activity recognition;Computational modeling;Context;Context modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Training","Internet of Things;human factors;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition","activity recognition;autonomous sensor-context learning;computational algorithms;data collection;dynamic human-centered Internet-of-Things environments;dynamic sensor;gating function;human-centered IoT;knowledge inference;mixture-of-expert model;multiview learning;on-body location;physical activities;shared expert models;transfer learning techniques;upper bound","","","","","","","","7-10 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Energy-efficient fault tolerance approach for Internet of Things applications","Teng Xu; M.

Non-volatile memory (NVM), on the other hand, is commonly used to improve system reliability due to its unique properties to retain data even if the power supply is lost. However, one of the most important drawbacks of NVM is that it imposes significant overhead regarding timing and energy. In this paper, we have proposed a unique technique with the use of NVM to create FT application specific architecture with almost no timing overhead and low energy overhead. We address the implementation of applications that are specified using synchronous data flow model of computation. We combine the use of NVM and classical CMOS transistors so that NVM judiciously stores selected complete states of the pertinent program. It allows the program to resume from the saved state in NVM when faults occur. The frequency of the state selection can be flexibly adjusted for an arbitrarily specified FT timing/energy overhead. Moreover, to find an optimal state selection (with low overhead), we have applied an improved min-cut max-flow algorithm. On a variety of typical benchmarks, the simulation results indicate that our approach incurs only a small overhead over lower bounds. It is also generic in a sense that it can be applied to a wide spectrum of underlying IoT architectures and computational models.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4466-1; POD:978-1-5090-3421-5","10.1145/2966986.2967034","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7827639","","","CMOS memory circuits;Internet of Things;energy conservation;fault tolerance;minimax techniques;random-access storage","CMOS transistors;FT;Internet of Things;IoT architectures;NVM;energy-efficient fault tolerance;mincut maxflow algorithm;nonvolatile memory;synchronous data flow model","","","","","","","","7-10 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although wireless networks are utilized in various applications and are providing the backbone for the Internet of Things (IoT), it remains fairly difficult to quickly prototype a visualization. The need for an easily accessible simulator is a necessity, sparked by the alarming growth of sensor networks and the IoT. The development of a reliable and robust large-scale wireless system requires that design concepts are visualized in some digital form, before implementation. Simulations provide a cost effective and feasible method of examining the correctness and scalability of the system before deployment. This work presents a lightweight and interactive topology generator as part of a novel web based network simulator. The simulation framework, to the best of our knowledge, is unlike any other, as it renders and generates graphs in the browser. A simple GUI allows the user to generate isotropic and anisotropic topologies of different shapes, and provides tools that help manipulate complex graphs on client browsers and mobile devices. This tool has its application in several domains including computer network configuration and management, sensor and ad-hoc networks, medical infrastructure, biological and social media visualizations.

These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively.

Ambient Assisted Living is definitely one of the most interesting area for WSN and IoT application. In this scenery we propose an applicative example of the use of a IPv6 self configuring WSN with mesh topology. The network is formed by low cost and low power sensor nodes that integrate sub-GHz radio connectivity, belonging to the so-called LLN (Low Power and Lossy Network) scenery. The network stack is fully compatible with the major RFCs about Internet and wireless communications (CSMA, 6LowPAN, uIP, UDP, CoAP, etc.). The case study is a localization system using RSSI feature and does not need additional expensive hardware to be integrated into the nodes. The system proves to be fundamental in indoor environments (houses, clinics, nursing homes) for AAL systems that require localization or tracking of patients and medical equipments.

Whereas current medical IoT devices typically acquire data with a constant quality, we propose an architecture that dynamically adjusts the data quality adaptively based on the current medical condition of the subject being monitored. Since transmission and processing make up a large fraction of the energy consumption, the reduction of the link traffic and processing effort caused by such an adjustment results in a decreased energy consumption of the devices. For example, if anomalies in the monitored data are detected, the monitoring is performed with an increased granularity and more exhaustive processing. Further, not all data generated by the medical sensors needs to be transmitted during all times. Only if certain events are detected, the transmission of the complete data needs to be activated. In this paper, we present a novel approach for body-worn medical IoT devices. In particular, a generic, distributed architecture for the power-management of the whole system, which is based on dynamically switching services, is presented. We show that such an architecture can reduce the energy-consumption of medical sensors by up to 80 % in real-world measurements.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3254-9; POD:978-1-5090-3255-6","10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794845","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7794845","","Electrocardiography;Energy consumption;Heart rate variability;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Sensors;Switches","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;medical computing;switching networks","Internet of Things;battery lifetimes;body-worn medical IoT devices;data quality;dynamic service switching;dynamically switching services;exhaustive processing;generic distributed architecture;granularity;link traffic;power-efficient techniques;power-management;processing effort","","","","","","","","4-8 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, it provides mutual authentication with anonymity and terminates with a session key agreement between each local base station and the hospital cloud server. To assess our scheme, we conduct performance and security analysis.

The area of application of such system is large in the medical domain making the system convenient for clinical use such as in sleep studies, non or partial anesthetic surgical procedures, medical-imaging techniques, and other areas involving the determination of the body-posture on a mattress. In this vein, a novel method for human body posture recognition that consists in providing an optimal combination of signal acquisition, processing, and data storage to perform the recognition task in a quasi-real-time basis. A supervised learning approach was used to build a model using a robust synthetic data. The data has been generated beforehand, in a way to enhance and generalize the recognition capability while maintaining both geometrical and spatial performance. Low-cost and fast computation per sample processing along with autonomy, make the system suitable for long-term operation and IoT applications.

One of its promising branches, the medical IoT, will also be accompanied by heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures. However, the efficacy of a medical IoT application will depend on how well the surrounding smart devices collaborate with it to serve the individual needs of the users. Pre-programmed solutions lack flexibility to adapt to each need and environment, and fail to make full use of the capabilities of a set of smart devices. In this paper, we propose a concept based on the flexible and user-friendly synthesis and switching of services for medical IoT applications. The crux of the concept is to provide a methodology in which non-experts can dynamically define services based on their needs. We describe a potential scenario, discuss the associated challenges, and present preliminary results on the feasibility of this approach. Particularly, we focus on design aspects for realizing the concept and propose the use of interpreters on the smart devices as alternative solution. We show that such an approach is feasible in terms of implementation and energy consumption while still maintaining the full flexibility of the service synthesis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4270-8; POD:978-1-5090-4271-5","10.1109/HLDVT.2016.7748259","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748259","Ambient Assisted Living;Automatic Synthesis;Cyber-Physical Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","","Internet of Things;ambient intelligence;assisted living;cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;medical computing","Internet of Things;ambient assisted living;cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;dynamic service synthesis;heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures;medical IoT;service switching;smart device collaboration;user-friendly synthesis","","","","","","","","7-8 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly.

Wearables leverage computational and machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from scratch upon any changes in the configuration of the network. Retraining of these algorithms requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and infeasible. We propose an approach for automatic retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our real-time multi-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an accuracy of 80.66% in activity recognition, which is an improvement of 15.96% in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node. This performance is only 7.96% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8729-3; POD:978-1-4673-8730-9","10.1145/2897937.2898066","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544381","","Internet of things;Labeling;Machine learning algorithms;Real-time systems;Training;Training data","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence)","human-centered Internet-of-Things;machine learning;multiview autonomous learning approach;plug-n-learn;wearable technology","","3","","","","","","5-9 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Independent component analysis (ICA) has prominent performance in this field. This paper proposed to apply particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to conduct accelerated computing of the rate of convergence of demixing matrix in ICA. Besides, it used Borel Regular Measure (BRM) based on Infomax to put forward a simple algorithm which was potential to be realized on a circuit chip. Our results of experiment have proved that after the separation of noises, the PSNR of the images has an apparent good effect.

"Are the Real Limits to Scale a Matter of Science, or Engineering, or of Something Else? (Abstract only)","R. Anderson","","2016 IEEE 29th Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF)","20160811","2016","","","16","16","Summary form only given. As people get excited about the latest idea for ""Big Data"" and the ""Internet of Things"", computer people often shake our heads and say ""It won't scale."" Pessimism isn't always justified: we have been able to scale up quite a number of tasks, from connectivity through search to social media. But other applications are recalcitrant, from energy management to medical records. The conventional computer-science view is that scaling systems is about computational complexity; about whether the storage or communications required for a task grows more than linearly in the number of users. Over the past thirty years we've developed a pretty good theory of that, but we're learning that it's nowhere near enough. In this talk I present a complementary view, based on over thirty years' experience of security engineering, that the real limits to scale are usually elsewhere. Even where the data are manageable and the algorithms straightforward, things can fail because of the scaling properties of the social context, the economic model or the regulatory environment. This makes some automation projects much harder than they seem. When it comes to safety and privacy many of the attacks that are easy to do in the lab are rare in the wild, as they don't scale either. But others surprise us; no-one in the intelligence community anticipated a leak on the Snowden scale. In short, scaling is now a problem not of computer science but of systems engineering, economics, governance and much else. Conceiving problems too narrowly makes failure likely, while good engineering will require ever more awareness of context. The implications for research, education and policy bear some thought.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2607-4; POD:978-1-5090-2608-1","10.1109/CSF.2016.41","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536363","","Big data;Computer security;Computers;Context;Economics;Head;Internet of things","security of data;social aspects of automation","Big Data;Internet of Things;computational complexity;computer people;computer-science view;economic model;energy management;medical records;regulatory environment;security engineering;social context;social media","","","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, digitisation of identification, tracking and monitoring of patients remains a challenge in rural areas of Africa, not to mention of associated power and internet connectivity constraints. This paper proposes a general architecture for monitoring of growth and vital parameters of under-five children. The system alerts medical personnel in real time about under-weight cases or abnormal readings of vital parameters in order to take further medical diagnosis. Furthermore, the system saves the child's personalised measurements to a cloud-based data store in real time. Preliminary tests of network performance of the IoT application design resulted in an average latency of 1.7s and system availability of 99.96%, thus validating its usability.","","Electronic:978-1-9058-2455-7; POD:978-1-5090-1955-7","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2016.7530674","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530674","Internet of things;health care system;sensors","Cloud computing;Internet of things;Medical services;Monitoring;Pediatrics;Sensors","Internet of Things;cloud computing;health care;medical information systems;patient diagnosis","Internet of Things;IoT application;cloud-based data store;medical diagnosis;medical information systems;smart under-five health care system","","","","","","","","11-13 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Skala","Ru&#273;er Bo&#353;kovi&#263; Institute, Centre for informatics and Computing, Zagreb, Croatia","2016 39th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","20160728","2016","","","164","168","Modern day computing paradigms foster for a huge community of involved participants from almost the entire spectrum of human endeavour. For computing and data processing there are individual Computers, their Clusters, Grids, and, finally, the Clouds. For pure data communication there is the Internet, and for the Human-understandable Information Communication for example the World Wide Web. The rapid development of hand-held mobile devices with high computational capabilities and Internet connectivity enabled certain parts of Clouds to be “lowered” into the so called “thin clients”. This led to development of the Fog-Computing Paradigm as well as development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) concepts. However, the most significant amount of information processing all around us is done on the lowest possible computing level, outright connected to the physical environment and mostly directly controlling our human immediate surroundings. These “invisible” information processing devices we find in our car's motor, in the refrigerator, the gas boiler, air-conditioners, wending machines, musical instruments, radio-receivers, home entertainment systems, traffic-controls, theatres, lights, wood-burning stoves, and ubiquitously all over the industry and in industrial products. These devices, which are neither at the cloud/fog edge, nor even at the mobile edge, but rather at the physical edge of computing are the basis of the Dew Computing Paradigm. The merits of seamlessly integrating those “dew” devices into the Cloud - Fog - Dew Computing hierarchy are enormous, for individuals, the public and industrial sectors, the scientific community and the commercial sector, by bettering the physical and communicational, as well as the intellectual, immediate human environment. In the possibility of dev- loping integrated home management/entertainment/maintenance systems, self-organising traffic-control systems, intelligent driver suggestion systems, coordinated building/car/traffic pollution control systems, real-time hospital systems with all patient and equipment status and control collaborating with the medical staff, fully consistent synaesthetic artistic performances including artists and independent individuals (“active public”) from wide apart, power distribution peek filtering, self-reorganisation and mutual cooperation systems based on informed behaviour of individual power consumption elements, emergency systems which cooperate with the town traffic, etc., etc., the Dew-Computing paradigm shows the way towards the Distributed Information Services Environment (DISE), and finally towards the present civilisation's aim of establishment of a Global Information Processing Environment (GIPE). It is therefore essential, through Research, Innovation and Development, to explore the realm of possibilities of Dew Computing, solve the basic problems of integration of the “dew” level with the higher level Dew-Fog-Cloud hierarchy, with special attention to the necessity of information (not only data) processing and communication, and demonstrate the viability and high effectiveness of the developed architecture in several areas of human endeavour through real life implementations. The present scientific and technological main objective is to provide the concepts, methods and proof-of-concept implementations that are moving Dew Computing from a theoretical/experimental concept to a validated technology. Finally, it will be necessary to define and standardise the basics of the Dew Computing Architecture, Language and Ontology, which is a necessity for the seamless integration of the emerging new Global Information Processing Architecture into the Fog and Cloud Paradigms, as a way towards the ab","","CD-ROM:978-953-233-088-5; Electronic:978-953-233-086-1; POD:978-1-5090-2543-5","10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522131","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7522131","","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Information processing;Internet of things;Supercomputers","cloud computing;network computers","DISE;GIPE;Internet connectivity;Internet of everything;Internet of things;IoE;IoT;World Wide Web;civilisation goals;cloud-fog edge;computational capabilities;coordinated building-car-traffic pollution control systems;dew computing;dew-fog-cloud hierarchy;distributed information services environment;fog-computing paradigm;global information processing environment;hand-held mobile devices;human endeavour;human-understandable information communication;integrated home management-entertainment-maintenance systems;intelligent driver suggestion systems;modern day computing paradigms;mutual cooperation systems;power consumption elements;power distribution peek filtering;pure data communication;real-time hospital systems;self-organising traffic-control systems;self-reorganisation;synaesthetic artistic performances;thin clients","","3","","","","","","May 30 2016-June 3 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of the protocols was evaluated using a network emulator, allowing us to emulate a low bandwidth, high system latency, and high packet loss wireless access network.

This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system. This work explains the implementation of an IoT based In-hospital healthcare system using ZigBee mesh protocol.

Power management is very important factor in considering WSN's and it has been demonstrated that communication cost is higher than the computational as nodes consume most of the energy in communication. Added to the fact that sensors could be closely deployed and report the same reading, the data aggregation concept was introduced to resolve those issues and for the sake of better performance at a reduced cost. Nonetheless, sensing devices are prone to failure due to several aspects such as node failure or low batteries as well as being compromised.

As both the privacy of personal medical data and flexible data access should be provided, the data in the Cloud are always encrypted and access control must be operated upon encrypted data together with being fine-grained to support diverse accessibility. Since a plain combination of encryption before access control is not robust and flexible, we propose a scheme with tailored design.

Microcameras with real time image processing can serve a wide range of applications like face or gesture recognition as well as traffic sign detection or lane departure warning. Today's microcameras consist of an optics module with lenses and image sensor, which is attached by a flex cable or connector to one or more PCB's with image processor and other required components. Drawback of this construction is limited reliability, relatively large size and high cost. This paper describes the development and realization of an extremely compact microcamera module using a highly efficient Panel Level Packaging (PLP) technology. Most components are embedded into a PCB of 16×16 mm2 size and 3.6 mm thickness with a weight of only 2 g. On top of the PCB a 3 MPixel image sensor is soldered. The basis of the module is a Cognivue image processor. Additionally the module contains 256 Mbit Flash Memory, 5 DC/DC converters, an oscillator and several passives. In total 74 components are embedded into the PCB. The module was completely realized on PCB format with in total 77 modules per 12""x9"" panel.

The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363124","","Computers;Conferences;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing","Internet of Things;health care;public key cryptography","DTLS session resumption technique;IoT;end-to-end security;energy performance evaluations;healthcare Internet-of-Things;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;remote end-users;remote patient monitoring prototype;security context;session resumption technique;smart gateways","","3","","22","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobile and wearable devices that have sensing and Internet access capabilities offer the opportunity of changing how medical services are delivered to the patients. The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology. The protocol stacks of the edge router and router are validated through successful connectivity tests and packet drop tests. The single-hop communication latency is also measured to give an indication of the overheads introduced by the stack.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7645-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-7646-1; POD:978-1-4799-7647-8","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.74","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307037","6LoWPAN;Internet of Things;pervasive healthcare;ultra-low power miniaturized mote","IP networks;Internet;Medical services;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet of Things;biomedical communication;health care;intelligent sensors;medical computing;patient monitoring;personal area networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","IPv6 accessibility;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet access capabilities;WSN;bare metal 6LoWPAN protocol;connectivity tests;edge router;embedded BAN supporting tree topology;healthcare services;medical services;mobile devices;packet drop tests;patient body area networks;power constraints;protocol stacks;router stack;single-hop communication latency;ultra-low power embedded mote;vital sign monitoring;wearable Internet of Things mote;wearable devices;wireless sensor networks","","1","","20","","","","9-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats. This paper considers the security aspects of telemedicine and the Internet of things (IoT) together, because, after all, healthcare-devices perform a function of telecommunication. This paper reviews the necessity and strategy for enhancing security of medical information systems. The risk of data leak in medical information systems is analyzed quantitatively and is used to support the need for reinforcement of security.","1738-9445;17389445","CD-ROM:978-8-9968-6504-9; Electronic:978-8-9968-6505-6; POD:978-1-4673-8116-1","10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224778","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7224778","IoT telemedicine;Telemedicine;Telemedicine security;U-health security;security","Hospitals;Information systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security;Telemedicine","Internet of Things;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;security of data;telemedicine","Internet of things;clinics;healthcare devices;medical information security threats;medical information systems;medium size hospitals;telemedicine service security","","0","","21","","","","1-3 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide hap tic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.","2329-6429;23296429","Electronic:978-1-4673-7284-8; POD:978-1-4673-7285-5","10.1109/MobServ.2015.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226677","Bluetooth low energy;internet of things;man-in-the-middle;security;vulnerability discovery;wearables","Biomedical monitoring;Bluetooth;Hardware;Mobile communication;Security;Sensors;Trade agreements","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;body area networks;mobile computing;security of data","Bluetooth LE;SecuWear platform;body area network;mobile Internet of Things;online Web servers;open source multicomponent hardware-software platform;security vulnerability test cases;smartphone user;wearable security","","4","","49","","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.<sup>1</sup>","2329-6267;23296267","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7556-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7557-3; POD:978-1-4673-7558-0","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208645","","Authentication;Linear regression;Performance evaluation;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Internet of Things;Zigbee;ad hoc networks","Internet of Things;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;ZigBee devices;nonparametric classifier random forest;nonparametric feature generation","","2","","22","","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, the coexistence of multiple WBANs (Wireless Body Area Networks), the communication and interactions between them extend the classical concept of WBAN and present the new paradigm referred to as Body-to-Body Network (BBN). This paradigm supports a number of innovative applications such as U-health, entertainment, interactive gaming and military, to cite a few.

"Enforcing security, safety and privacy for the Internet of Things","C. W. Axelrod","Delta Risk LLC, Great Neck, NY, USA","2015 Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology","20150716","2015","","","1","6","The connecting of physical units, such as thermostats, medical devices and self-driving vehicles, to the Internet is happening very quickly and will most likely continue to increase exponentially for some time to come. Valid concerns about security, safety and privacy do not appear to be hampering this rapid growth of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). There have been many popular and technical publications by those in software engineering, cyber security and systems safety describing issues and proposing various “fixes.” In simple terms, they address the “why” and the “what” of IoT security, safety and privacy, but not the “how.” There are many cultural and economic reasons why security and privacy concerns are relegated to lower priorities. Also, when many systems are interconnected, the overall security, safety and privacy of the resulting systems of systems generally have not been fully considered and addressed. In order to arrive at an effective enforcement regime, we will examine the costs of implementing suitable security, safety and privacy and the economic consequences of failing to do so. We evaluated current business, professional and government structures and practices for achieving better IoT security, safety and privacy, and found them lacking. Consequently, we proposed a structure for ensuring that appropriate security, safety and privacy are built into systems from the outset. Within such a structure, enforcement can be achieved by incentives on one hand and penalties on the other. Determining the structures and rules necessary to optimize the mix of penalties and incentives is a major goal of this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8643-9; POD:978-1-4799-8644-6","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160214","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160214","Internet of Things (IoT);privacy;safety;security;software liability;system development lifecycle (SDLC);time to value;value hills;vulnerability marketplace","Government;Privacy;Safety;Security;Software;Standards","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","Internet of Things;IoT privacy;IoT safety;IoT security;cyber security;software engineering","","5","","11","","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter would create a much more adverse impact on these devices than the former, resulting in significant performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel area packet scheduler that allows co-located 802.15.4 and 802.11 devices to share the transmission channel and coexist with minimal inter-cluster interference any inter cluster interference. A new OPNET simulation model was developed to evaluate the performance of this scheduler.

In view of the scarcity of spectrum and the service requirements of traditional users, providing network access to the extremely large number of devices in IoT and M2M scenarios is one of the fundamental problems for network designers and operators. As a possible solution to this issue, this paper explores the possibility of using the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band for supporting M2M communications while co-existing with traditional users of this band. Since IEEE 802.11 or WiFi based networks are the most common networking technology in the ISM band, this paper presents an evaluation of “white spaces” in WiFi networks (i.e. periods where the WiFi network is not using the channel) that may be used opportunistically for M2M communications. Using a MMPP/G/1/K queue to model the operation of a WiFi access point, we characterize the WiFi white spaces in terms of their frequency, duration, and their probability distribution.

At the same time, the energy and transient power needs of functions such as wireless connectivity, information display, and high sample rate sensing must be supported. These capabilities have time-dependent power and current requirements often not captured in simple energy and capacity metrics. In this paper, a progression of energy storage approaches, challenges and learning experiences will be presented from the perspective of an energy storage technology developer. The essential requirements for energy storage for feature-driven applications in flexible electronics are addressed with the goal of finding the most compelling fit between products needs, consumer safety and the technology capabilities of different energy storage approaches. Micropower modules from supercapacitors to microbatteries and their limitations for flexible electronics will be discussed in terms of capacity, power and charge retention as the starting point. Following this discussion, limitations of lithium technologies in this flexible and thin (<; 1 mm) application space are also outlined. This paper then presents a review of key requirements for energy storage for high functionality flexible electronics prototype systems and some approaches that have been explored to meet those needs. This leads to the conclusion that safe, low cost, flexible electronics energy storage requirements may be most appropriately met using intrinsically stable battery chemistry. Furthermore, such a materials approach allows for simpler lower cost processing and packaging, such as additive printing and roll to roll processing of thin and therefore more mechanically flexible cells. E- amples and performance data from such a zinc polymer battery technology are given and compared to other thin and flexible battery approaches.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2015.2406340","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110431","Batteries;body sensor networks;internet of things;printed circuits;wearable sensors","Batteries;Capacitors;Energy storage;Flexible electronics;Packaging;Wearable computing","energy storage;flexible electronics;secondary cells","additive printing;battery chemistry;energy storage;flexible battery;flexible electronic systems;mechanically flexible cells;roll to roll processing;zinc polymer battery technology","","14","","62","","","","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Resource sharing between M2M and H2H traffic under time-controlled scheduling scheme in LTE networks","K. Edemacu; T.

M2M communication has many areas of application, such as in; medical, transport, environmental monitoring, smart grids among others. As the field of its application expands, the number of M2M devices is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years. Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been identified as one of the suitable wireless communication technologies for M2M communication. Incorporating M2M communication on top of regular Human-to-Human (H2H) communication in LTE is a challenging task due to the expected increase in the number of M2M devices coupled with the unique characteristics of M2M traffic. Therefore, the current scheduling and resource allocation techniques among others being used in LTE need to be refined to efficiently accommodate M2M communication. A scheduling scheme called fixed Access Grant Time Interval (AGTI) time-controlled scheduling scheme was proposed for scheduling M2M traffic in LTE. Resource sharing and utilization under this scheme is inefficient due to fixed AGTI assignment which results into fixed nature of resource allocation. In this work, we propose a scheduling scheme called Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme in which the AGTI is dynamically assigned basing on M2M and H2H traffic intensities. We model the proposed scheme using M/G/m/m queuing technique focusing on resource utilization and Quality of Service (QoS) of both M2M and H2H traffic. The analytical results show that, the Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme achieves; better percentage resource utilization as compared to Fixed AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme while providing optimal blocking probability for both M2M and H2H traffic. However, the monitoring of resource usage and reassignments of AGTI in Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme increases scheduler complexity.","","DVD:978-1-4799-7446-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-7447-4; POD:978-1-4799-7448-1","10.1109/TSSA.2014.7065909","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065909","Fixed AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme and Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme;Human-to-Human communication;LTE;Machine-to-Machine Communication","Delays;Dynamic scheduling;Equations;Long Term Evolution;Quality of service;Resource management","Long Term Evolution;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;synchronisation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","H2H communication;H2H traffic;LTE networks;Long Term Evolution;M-G-m-m queuing technique;M2M communication;M2M devices;M2M traffic;QoS;access grant time interval;dynamic AGTI ime-controlled scheduling scheme;fixed AGTI time-controlled scheduling scheme;human-to-human communication;machine-to-machine communication;optimal blocking probability;quality of service;resource allocation techniques;resource sharing;resource usage;resource utilization;scheduler complexity;wireless communication technologies","","6","","12","","","","23-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce these issues the platform integrates the fast, easy-to-use, safe and low-power Near Field Communication protocol for data transmission in proximity, addressing the Internet of Things paradigm. The platform uses the Arduino NANO board and the related open source software libraries, so it could be possible to add new functionalities in a fast way.

Considering that the Android operating system allows data storage, connectivity, Web browser, media support, development environment, we propose to develop an application that will come in support to any patient who is suffering from hypotension/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or other metabolic diseases associated, and even more for patients with vision impairments who are unable to be independent. With the help of such application the patients and physicians can monitor measured values of blood pressure, values of blood glucose, weight, body mass index, cholesterol, etc., having the possibility of creating a database and a medical history, in which the values specified by the medical devices are stored on the smartphone using Bluetooth™ technique.

The main goal of this global connectivity is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. IPv6, the new Internet Protocol has made every grain of sand on earth addressable and thus emergence of a new technology called IoT. IoT is simply a machine to machine M2M communication and Sensor nodes are proved to be best suited for this new technology. IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) has attracted lots of attention recently as it can be used for communication of IoT. This paper provides a framework for medical environment, for reducing handoff (HO) latency and signaling overhead while the patient is on the move inside the hospital premises and further it can be applied to other domains also where can be applicable. Sensor nodes can be used for collecting the particular parameters of human body which constitutes wireless body area network (WBAN).

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.","2168-2194;21682194","Electronic:978-1-4799-2131-7; POD:978-1-4799-2132-4","10.1109/BHI.2014.6864307","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6864307","","Authorization;Cloud computing;Filtering;Medical services;Ontologies;Semantics","authorisation;electronic health records;granular computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","IOT;Internet of things;RABAC;attribute-based access control;cloud computing;data access;granular security concepts;granularity levels;health care providers;health information collection;health information transmission;healthcare information systems;healthcare professional component;information storage;local security policies;medical device component;nonhealthcare component;nonhealthcare providers;ontology;patient data;patient-centered model;patient-specified authorization policies;personal health record;role-based access control;semantic matching;semantic rule reasoning;social care providers;social information collection;virtual PHR authorization system","","1","","16","","","","1-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, the assets identification using passive tags turns to active identification enabling automatic inventorying and permanent assets protection at the same time. Active identification provides also the remote monitoring of objects, moreover, when object's data are safely shared on Internet environment, a number of cloud services can be enabled to allow customers remote monitoring of objects. Based on such ICT environment, the architecture called Internet of Things is ready to come to daily life. The objects considered in such systems can be home appliances, medical devices, building assets, computers, mobile devices, cars, production components, manufacturing tools, building materials and, of course, people.

Recently, many research results of IoT related to emergency system, smart building and medical system, etc. The key for IoT applications are the ability to interact with physical world through computation, communication, and machine control. However, each sensor device in IoT cannot conveniently communicate with other terminal devices through internet protocol. So, it is necessary to establish protocol translation stack or equipment between two WSN groups. That is very inefficient and high overhead cost of network construction. The development of micro-IP (uIP) solves this problem. The uIP reduce cost of protocol translation and it also realizes the machine to machine (M2M) concept in wireless sensor network. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution for porting uIP library to the wireless sensor network devices and presents the integration of a speaker module and IPv6 ready sensor device. We also propose a safe building application based on the integrated system to help people escaping from disaster environment. In conclusion, our contributions are building an IPv6 ready wireless sensor network environment and develop a safe building system to make the concept of IoT in IPv6 network environment come true.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4986-6; POD:978-1-4673-6494-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.124","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6649913","IPSO;IPv6;Internet of things;emergency escape system;machine to machine","Buildings;Hardware;IP networks;Information management;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet of Things;disasters;emergency management;home automation;transport protocols;wireless sensor networks","IPv6 network environment;IPv6 ready sensor device;Internet of Things;Internet protocol;IoT applications;M2M;WSN groups;disaster environment;emergency system;machine to machine;medical system;microIP;network construction;overhead cost;physical world;protocol translation stack;safe building application;safe building system;smart building;speaker module;terminal devices;uIP library;wireless sensor network devices","","1","","19","","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its advances, among other things, enable new opportunities for better health services but, as a side effect, it introduces new threats to privacy. If anywhere, it is in the health care sector that privacy is of utmost importance. Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most ""primitive"" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning. This latter contribution also paves the way for further development and for applications of pervasive computing in general.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2013.6590047","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6590047","","Computer security;Electronic medical records;Logic gates;Medical services;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;computer network security;data privacy;health care;medical computing;radiofrequency identification;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things technology;RFID;bare sensors;body area network deployment;computationally weak pervasive computing systems;data privacy;e-health;electronic health;hard security provisioning;health care sector;primitive member;soft security provisioning;wireless medical sensor deployment","","8","","15","","","","August 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is also a growing trend toward integrating real world data into the Internet, which is provided by sensory devices, smart phones, GPS, and many other sources that capture and communicate real world data. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real world objects (i.e., Things). This paper focuses on how to optimize the data exchange between the sensory devices and applications in IoT and Cyber-Physical systems. In particular, a method to construct higher-level abstractions of data at local gateways is proposed. This will reduce the traffic load imposed on the communication networks that provide the real world data. The proposed method is based on an information processing algorithm where gateways analyze the data collected from the sensors and create higher level abstractions. We enhance the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) algorithm that is used as a building block of the abstraction creation framework, into an optimized version for sensor data, called sensor SAX. We extend the parsimonious covering theory that is usually used for medical purposes with a probabilistic parsimonious criterion in the temporal domain to infer abstractions based on time-dependent sensor data. The proposed method is analyzed and evaluated over a real world data set and the results are discussed in terms of the data size reduction, accuracy, and latency needed to create the abstractions.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2271562","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548071","Information abstraction;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks","","Internet;Internet of Things;approximation theory;data structures;probability","Internet of Things;cyber-physical systems;data exchange;heterogeneous real world Internet data;higher-level abstractions;information abstraction;information processing algorithm;local gateways;medical purposes;parsimonious covering theory;probabilistic parsimonious criterion;sensor SAX algorithm;symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm","","15","","28","","","20130627","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services. In this paper we will present a general m-IoT architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology for measurement of body temperature as an example for healthcare application.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-469-3","10.1049/ic.2011.0036","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6183148","Internet of Things;Wireless Sensor Network;chronic disease management;m-health","","4G mobile communication;IP networks;Internet;health care;mobile computing;personal area networks;temperature measurement","4G network;6LoWPAN technology;AAL environment;IP-based communication technology interconnection;Internet based healthcare service;Internet of M-health things;body temperature measurement;communication connectivity;elderly disabled patient care service;evolutionary concept;healthcare connectivity paradigm;heterogeneous connectivity environment;innovative networking architecture;intelligent identification;intelligent management;m-IoT architecture;medical sensor;mobile computing;sensing device","","5","","","","","","6-6 April 2011","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate the application of IoT in the area of pervasive medicine. We propose a practical network architecture for local medicine and health system based on GSM/3G/Internet infrastructure and Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN), called Community Medical Networks (CMN). CMN needs lower cost for deployment, supports user's mobility, can reduce the time and cost of diagnosis and treatment of diseases (especially chronic/paroxysmal diseases) as well as realizes individualization (patient-centered), cooperation and data-sharing in a distributed manner. We describe the implementation of CMN in detail in application level and operation level (business model). We also analyze the requirement of traffic related parameters of CMN when using WCDMA and Zigbee-based WBASN. A promising use case of CMN for heart disease is given to illustrate the feasibility, economical and social benefit of implementing CMN in typical Chinese cities.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0348-4; POD:978-1-4673-0346-0","10.1109/GMC.2011.6103930","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103930","Community Medical Networks;Internet of Things;Wireless Body Area Network;pervasive medicine","Diseases;Heart;Hospitals;Logic gates;Medical diagnostic imaging;Mobile communication;Monitoring","3G mobile communication;Zigbee;body area networks;cellular radio;code division multiple access;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;wavelength division multiplexing;wireless sensor networks","CMN;GSM/3G/Internet infrastructure;WCDMA;Zigbee-based WBASN;community medical network;internet of things;mobile Internet;traffic related parameters;wireless body area sensor network","","1","","8","","","","17-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the future Internet oriented to Internet-of-things and awareness context solutions is essential to support mobility and global addressing.

This paper presents an architecture to support medical sensor networks based on 6LoWPAN, where we have defined a protocol to carry out inter-WSN mobility. This protocol shows how we exploit the other elements of the architecture (sink nodes and gateways) with high capacity and resources, hence mobile nodes decrease the number of interchanged messages it needs with regard to other solutions for mobility like MIPv6.

The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD con- ersion.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2549363","Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study at the University of California, San Diego; Institute for the Study of Aging, with participation from the U.S. FDA; Laboratory of Neuroimaging at the University of California, Los Angeles; Northern California Institute for Research and Education; Pfizer Inc., Wyeth Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co.

The Internet of Things everywhere will encourage billions of devices, individuals and administrations to interconnect to trade data and helpful information. Each object has special ID which is used for recognizable proof. In future, practically every electronic device will be a smart device which can register and speak with handheld and other framework equipment. As most of the IoT devices are battery operated and requires less power consumption, the safety and protection is a real issue in IoT. Identification, Authentication and device diversity are the real security and protection concern in IoT.

In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs — and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation — are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed. This does not apply to computer science programs alone but also to other fields of study.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2314-5; POD:978-1-5386-2315-2; USB:978-1-5386-2313-8","10.1109/RoboMech.2017.8261102","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8261102","","Computer science;Education;Games;Head;Magnetic heads;Medical services;Security","","","","","","","","","","Nov. 30 2017-Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. The present paper address some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a Secure Digital Camera (SDC) integrated with the Secure Better Portable Graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this work is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection: concurrent encryption and watermarking which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management (DRM). The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: (1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image, and (2) frequency domain watermarking using block-wise DCT of size 8×8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant incre- se of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795478","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8263198","Better Portable Graphics;Consumer Electronics;Image Communications;Internet of Things (IoT);Secure Digital Camera;Smart Healthcare","Computer architecture;Digital cameras;Image coding;Medical services;Watermarking","","","","","","","","","20180118","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Improved Reconstruction of Low Intensity Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with Weighted Low Rank Hankel Matrix Completion","D. Guo; X. Qu","School of Computer and Information Engineering, Fujian Provincial University Key Laboratory of Internet of Things Application Technology, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen 361024, China.","IEEE Access","","2018","PP","99","1","1","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) has many important applications in medical imaging, biology and chemistry. The one dimensional MRS is too crowded for complex samples to retrieve chemical or biological information. Two dimensional MRS unfolds the spectrum by introducing another dimension at the cost of much longer data acquisition time. To speed up the data acquisition, one typical way is to sparsely acquire measurements and then reconstruct the spectrum from incomplete observations. Recently, a low rank Hankel matrix (LRHM) approach has shown great potential to reconstruct the spectrum basing on the assumption that the number of spectral peaks is much less than the number of acquired data points. However, low intensity spectral peaks are compromised in the reconstruction when the data are highly undersampled. In this paper, a weighted LRHM approach is proposed to tackle this problem. A weighted nuclear norm is introduced to better approximate the rank constraint and a prior signal space is estimated from the pre-reconstruction to reduce the unknowns in reconstruction. Experimental results on both synthetic and real MRS data demonstrate that the proposed approach can reconstruct low intensity spectral peaks better than the state-of-the-art LRHM method.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794478","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262652","Hankel matrix;Magnetic resonance spectroscopy;low rank;nuclear norm;sparse sampling","Data acquisition;Image reconstruction;Mathematical model;Matrix converters;Minimization;Spectroscopy;Two dimensional displays","","","","","","","","","20180117","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Kim","","2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","20180111","2017","","","206","211","In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1324-5; POD:978-1-5386-1325-2","10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251290","Haar transform;Haar wavelet;IoT;clustering;correlation;distance measure;healthcare;time series","Correlation;Euclidean distance;Market research;Medical services;Physiology;Time series analysis;Transforms","","","","","","","","","","23-25 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1104-3; POD:978-1-5386-1105-0; USB:978-1-5386-1103-6","10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249087","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8249087","Application;Applied engineering;Consumer electronics;Healthcare electronics;Intel Edison;Internet of Things;Mechatronics;Medical electronics;Patient care;SMS;Traumatic Brain Injury;Wireless computing","Acceleration;Brain injuries;Force;Head;Resistors;Sensors","","","","","","","","","","19-21 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a balanced-bit-serial adder (BBSA) as a basic unit of parallel-balanced-bit-serialization (PBBS) operation, which leverages timing borrowing to mitigate delay variation. In addition, we propose two latches to improve the effectiveness of timing borrowing and ease the area and power overhead of BBSA. The proposed BBSA is verified in TSMC 40-nm CMOS technology. Compared with the flip-flop-based bit-serial adder, energy consumption of BBSA is saved by 40% and area efficiency is improved by 15% as well.

Internet of Things (IoT) is the new technology which includes the collection of Sensors, Actuators, processors and other development boards (eg. Raspberry pi, Arduino etc) to collect the data from different sources depending upon domain of application, process the acquired data before sending to distant cloud or mobile application depending upon the requirement[7]. The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe. MQTT is a lightweight protocol which is developed for a machine to machine (M2M) communication.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6471-7; POD:978-1-5090-6472-4","10.1109/CCAA.2017.8230003","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8230003","ECG;IoT;MQTT;Raspberry Pi;healthcare","Cloud computing;Electrocardiography;Hardware;Medical services;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensors","","","","","","","","","","5-6 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their large-scale pervasive deployment within the population has already attracted many malware authors, cybercriminals, and even governments. Since the first demonstration of mobile malware by Marcos Velasco, millions of these have been developed with very sophisticated capabilities. They infiltrate highly secure networks using air-gap jumping capability (e.g., “Hammer Drill” and “Brutal Kangaroo”) and spread through heterogeneous computing and communication platforms. Some of these cross-platform malware attacks are capable of infiltrating isolated control systems which might be running a variety of operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Linux. This paper investigates cross-platform/heterogeneous mobile malware that uses removable media, such as USB connection, to spread between incompatible computing platforms and operating systems. Deep analysis and modeling of cross-platform mobile malware are conducted at the micro (infection) and macro (spread) levels. The micro-level analysis aims to understand the cross-platform malware states and transitions between these states during node-to-node infection. The micro-level analysis helps derive the parameters essential for macro-level analysis, which are also crucial for the elaboration of suitable detection and prevention solutions. The macro-level analysis aims to identify the most important factors affecting cross-platform mobile malware spread within a digitized population. Through simulation, we show that identifying these factors helps to mitigate any outbreaks.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2772787","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105807","Internet of Things (IoT);Smartphone;coloured Petri nets (CPN) modelling;epidemic model;industrial control systems;mobile;mobile malware","Computational modeling;Malware;Mobile communication;Payloads;Smart phones;Universal Serial Bus;Viruses (medical)","","","","","","","","","20171113","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IoT devices are diverse in nature but are typically constrained by limited power availability, limited area budget and the need for modularity of design. The burden of ultra-low-power budget unfortunately doesn't necessarily mean that other performance requirements are relaxed. The tutorial is therefore geared towards designers of IoT devices including sensors, MEMS, mobile devices, medical sensors, wireless communication devices, near field communication devices, energy harvesting designs, mobile devices, and wireless communication devices. It will focus on how automated circuit sizing and tuning methodologies can be used to enhance existing design expertise to reduce power consumption while trade-off with other circuit performances. Additionally it will be shown how features like circuit sensitivity analysis can be used for confirming design hypotheses.

Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events.

Various vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, and controls have been introduced for the new generation of CPS. However, there lacks a systematic review of the CPS security literature. In particular, the heterogeneity of CPS components and the diversity of CPS systems have made it difficult to study the problem with one generalized model. In this paper, we study and systematize existing research on CPS security under a unified framework. The framework consists of three orthogonal coordinates: 1) from the <italic>security</italic> perspective, we follow the well-known taxonomy of threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and controls; 2) from the CPS <italic>components</italic> perspective, we focus on cyber, physical, and cyber-physical components; and 3) from the CPS systems perspective, we explore general CPS features as well as representative systems (e.g., smart grids, medical CPS, and smart cars). The model can be both abstract to show general interactions of components in a CPS application, and specific to capture any details when needed. By doing so, we aim to build a model that is abstract enough to be applicable to various heterogeneous CPS applications; and to gain a modular view of the tightly coupled CPS components. Such abstract decoupling makes it possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight the potential sources of attacks and ways of protection. With this intensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the state-of-the-art on CPS security, provide researchers with a comprehensive list of references, and also encourage the audience to further explore this emerging field.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2703172","National 973 Program of China; University of Kansas RIC Strategic Initiative Grant10.13039/100000144; 10.13039/100000082 - U.S. National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100000144 - U.S. National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100002367 - Strategy Pilot Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7924372","Attacks;controls;cyber physical systems (CPSs);industrial control systems (ICSs);medical devices;security;smart cars;smart grids;threats;vulnerabilities","Computer security;Control systems;Cyber-physical systems;Integrated circuits;Security;Smart grids;Wireless communication","","","","3","","","","","20170510","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Applications of CPS span various fields such as medical monitoring, traffic control, and smart grid. With such widespread applications, privacy assurance is becoming more and more important since what the CPS connects are people and the real world. Any leakage of private information will cause serious consequences. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the secrecy of wireless communications in CPS by use of physical layer security techniques. Specifically, we study an amplify and forward (AF) relay network where all devices are equipped with a single antenna. We propose a privacy-enhanced waveform design approach aided by artificial noise (AN) to enhance the communication secrecy in a wireless environment with multipath receptions. First, we consider the case with perfect eavesdropper’s channel state information (CSI). We optimize the AF coefficient for forwarding the information-bearing signal and the AN covariance to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. The optimal solution is obtained by solving a series of semidefinite programs. Then, a more practical scenario with imperfect eavesdropper’s CSI is studied. We develop a robust waveform design method and obtain the lower bound of the achievable secrecy rate. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2684221","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Science and Technology Major Project; Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882703","Cyber-physical system (CPS);physical layer security (PLS);privacy;relay transmission;waveform design;wireless communications","Covariance matrices;Cyber-physical systems;Privacy;Protocols;Relays;Security;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","20170320","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'.

Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.","","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2769670","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094871","BCI;EEG big data;cloud computing;deep learning;epilepsy;seizure prediction and localization","Big Data;Brain-computer interfaces;Cloud computing;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Real-time systems","","","","","","","","Traditional","20171103","Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer).

These limitations are impediments to any large-scale BLE based IoT deployment (e.g., in hospital environments), where such sophisticated network-based visibility and control may be required. Relying on cloud-based solutions to meet these requirements has many known shortcomings. This paper proposes an SDN-based architecture for enabling wide area IoT deployments using BLE devices at the edge. We introduce a programmable BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices.

Such a coupling allow biomedical signal compressors to self-establish hard limits with regards to choices surrounding compression ratios, or `quality settings', a compressor can safely choose from to guarantee that features of clinical significance are protected so that their reconstruction remains clinically relevant. This coupling allows biomedical signal compressors to operate in an unsupervised manner, since it is demonstrated that establishing hard limits that are applied equally to all signals does not allow one to maximize and/or strike a balance between compression ratio and signal fidelity. Such mechanisms can be employed in communication architectures in wearable body area sensor networks (BASNs) for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications for autonomous tasks. While feature-based distortion measures such as the Clinical Distortion Index (CDI), and the Weighted Distortion Measure (WDD) already exist, we demonstrate the viability of our work by proposing a generalizable feature-based distortion measure we call the Diagnostic Distortion Measure (DDM), which offers several benefits that address a few shortcomings present in the CDI and WDD in real-time applications for unsupervised self-guided compressors.

However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can be considered as a promising solution for detecting, reporting emergency events, eliminating the hoax calls and responding swiftly saving lives.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3839-2; POD:978-1-5386-3840-8; USB:978-1-5386-3838-5","10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115830","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115830","IP communication session;Internet of Things;IoT;SIP based calls;eHealth;emergency calls;seizure;sensor devices","Conferences;Emergency services;Medical services;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;diseases;emergency services;health care","IoT automated SIP;IoT devices;IoTA framework;automatically emergency calls;bi-directional communication sessions;communication technologies;emergency call triggering system;emergency events;emergency incident;emergency services;general eHealth;healthcare providers;public safety stakeholders;support session-oriented communications","","","","","","","","9-11 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong per-slice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled “switch node”, called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices. We describe the design of BLESS, and illustrate its utility through a few practical use cases.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2784-6; POD:978-1-5386-2785-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116440","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116440","","Conferences;IP networks;Medical services;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Switches","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;personal area networks;software defined networking","BLE based IoT service deployment;BLE service switch;BLESS;Bluetooth low energy service;IoT devices;SDN;access controls;central controller;dynamic enforcement;large-scale Internet of Things deployment;low-energy personal area wireless network technology;network slice;per-slice policy enforcement;service layer;simple network topologies;sizable geographic region;switch node;wide-area IoT service slices","","","","","","","","1-4 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence.

Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14).

The first approach utilizes phase locked loop (PLL) to multiply the frequency of a very accurate Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS), generating a FMCW signal. The second approach multiplies the generated DDS signal using a frequency multiplier (F12). Counter-intuitive existence of low power harmonics (F13, F14, F11, F10, etc.) in the frequency multiplier added improvements in our tests. Tiny variations in environment are easily observed on specific bars in FFT of down-converted signals in the frequency multiplier approach. Both approaches work by sending a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) that reflects off objects present in the room. Based on the reflected signal, we calculate distances and movements, from which we then extract breathing and heart rates. In both approaches, we try two sets of microwave signals: Triangular FMCW and Sawtooth FMCW. Both approaches showed more obvious variation for body movement. In the case of the Triangular FMCW signal, interpreting data is more challenging. On the other hand, the Sawtooth FMCW signal resulted in clear output but lower power and harder to directly observe.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3281-9; POD:978-1-5386-3282-6","10.1109/FiCloudW.2017.105","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113799","Vital sign monitoring;m-health;signal processing","Bandwidth;Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate;Phase locked loops;Radar;Time-frequency analysis","direct digital synthesis;fast Fourier transforms;frequency modulation;medical signal detection;microwave measurement;patient monitoring;phase locked loops;pneumodynamics","Direct Digital Synthesizer;Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave;Sawtooth FMCW signal;Triangular FMCW signal;body movement;breathing;counter-intuitive existence;down-converted signals;frequency multiplier approach;generated DDS signal;heart rates;low power harmonics;m-health application;microwave signals;phase locked loop;reflected signal;remote monitoring;vital signs","","","","","","","","21-23 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2324-4; POD:978-1-5386-2325-1; USB:978-1-5386-2323-7","10.1109/MASS.2017.62","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108772","Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing;Shannon Mapping","Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Medical services;Power demand;Sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic","AJSCC device;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;Analog Signal compression;FPMM receiver;FPMM technique;IoT applications;IoT devices;IoT scalability;SNR operating region;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;analog domain;analog encoding;encoding method;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;healthcare Internet of Things;joint modulation;mean square error;miss detection rate;multiplexing technique;multisignal compression method;power consumption;power saving;traffic data","","","","","","","","22-25 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario.

Although the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection.

To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.","1089-7798;10897798","","10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010262","Cloud computing;Internet of Things (IoT);blindness;privacy;wireless body area networks (WBANs)","Body area networks;Cloud computing;Delays;Hospitals;Servers;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","20170814","Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We present a scenario when eHealth IoT solutions can be used to manage the consequences after a natural or any other disaster as a kind of a technology-enabled crisis management. Consequences occur when the existing policies allow unpreparedness, unprotectedness, and inability to respond effectively.

It causes deterioration in health leading to multi-organ failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user’s infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user’s mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090542","Chikungunya;Cloud Computing;Decision Tree;Fog Computing;Temporal Network Analysis (TNA).","Cloud computing;Decision trees;Monitoring;Pain;Real-time systems;Sensors","","","","","","","","","20171031","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Yaseen","National University of Sciences and Technology. Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.","IEEE Access","","2017","PP","99","1","1","e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end to end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSN), to incorporating the internet of things (IoT), to communication links, to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise is of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and the future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level towards the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision - aking regarding their PHI/EHR. A lot of work and effort is necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/ pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767561","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8089328","Access Control;Anonymity;Privacy;e-Healthcare","Access control;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Medical services;Privacy;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20171030","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The first segment assumes the communication between nanosensor and intra-body device, whereas in the second one the intra-body device is engaged to the bio-cyber interface through the THz band. Others segments belong to the macroscopic scale but working in the MHz band. When the full QoS is estimated and assuming the most optimistic scenario, our crude estimation for the concrete case applied to nanomedicine has turned out to to be of order of 85%.

A fully differential approach is used in the electromagnetic and circuit modeling to capture noise on all parts of the passive network. Noise quantification accuracy is studied for different analyses that are part of the design flow: FEA, macro-modeling & SPICE simulation. Noise reduction in physical design through PVT invariant band gap and electromagnetic isolation through Faraday cage are investigated.","","CD:978-1-5386-2228-5; Electronic:978-1-5386-2231-5; POD:978-1-5386-2232-2; Paper:978-1-5386-2229-2; USB:978-1-5386-2230-8","10.1109/ISEMC.2017.8077872","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8077872","ADC;ADC resolution;FEM Solver;IoT;Low noise;SPICE;macro modeling;power integrity;reference voltage;sensor","Finite element analysis;Integrated circuit modeling;Photonic band gap;SPICE;Scattering parameters;Sensitivity;Sensors","SPICE;analogue-digital conversion;biomedical electronics;biomedical equipment;finite element analysis;medical signal processing;passive networks;signal denoising;signal resolution","12-bit ADC reference voltage supply;Faraday cage;PVT invariant band gap;compact IoT system designs;design flow;digital convertor;electrical modeling;electromagnetic circuit modeling;electromagnetic isolation;environment information;extremely quiet reference;fully differential approach;industrial instrumentation;macro-modeling;medical applications;multiple sensors;noise quantification accuracy;noise reduction;noise target;physical design considerations;sub-millivolt noise;voltage 244.0 muV","","","","","","","","7-11 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration. Based on the type of data transmission; proactive or reactive, these devices will process and provide the data for the health monitoring company to take the correct action when patient's state of health moves outside normal range.

Common diabetic test on patients are done on urinary test and blood ketone test to monitor for diabetes condition. However, those methods are considers as invasive, inconvenient and expensive. Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors.

We present in this article an elementary prototype design of a configurable Data Aggregation Unit (DAU). DAU acts like a data traffic manager to handle data based on information content. It has three modes of operation, which allow the HEP experiments to optimize resource cost with data reliability. A detailed queuing model of the system is formulated, to help designers to prevent or predict data congestion and initiate data traffic diversion.

In SG, the main focus of the researchers is on home energy management (HEM) system, which is called demand side management (DSM). Appliance scheduling is an integral part of HEM system as it manages energy demand according to supply, by automatically controlling the appliances and shifting the load from peak to off peak hours. In this paper, the comparative performance of HEM controller embedded with heuristic algorithms; harmony search algorithm (HSA), enhanced differential evolution (EDE) and harmony search differential evolution (HSDE) is evaluated. The integration of renewable energy source (RES) in SG makes the performance of HEM system more efficient. The electricity consumption in peak hours usually creates peaks and increases the cost but integration of RES makes the electricity consumer able to use the appliances in the peak hours.We formulate our problem using multiple knapsack theory that the maximum capacity of the consumer of electricity must be in the range which is bearable for consumer with respect to electricity bill. Feasible regions are defined to validate the formulated problem. Finally, simulation of the proposed techniques is conducted in MATLAB to validate the performance of proposed scheduling algorithms in terms of cost, peak to average ratio and waiting time minimization.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2763624","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8070309","Smart grid;demand side management;enhanced differential evolution;harmony search algorithm;home energy management system;knapsack","Energy consumption;Energy management;Heuristic algorithms;Home appliances;Optimization;Peak to average power ratio;Pricing","","","","","","","","","20171017","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption.

Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care.

To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce embedded multiple flows (EMF) communication method, which (i) embeds different pieces of information in existing traffic and (ii)concurrently sends out these information from one IoT sender to multiple IoT receivers that have a different communication technology from the sender.

In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5336-0; POD:978-1-5090-5337-7","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056954","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056954","","Cloud computing;Encryption;Medical services;Reliability;Servers","body area networks;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;health care;medical computing;message authentication;patient monitoring","Bloom filter;HSP;cloud computing;cloud storage;cloud-assisted body area networks;data owner assistance;dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme;forward privacy;healthcare industry;healthcare service providers;message authentication code;periodically generated healthcare data;privacy concerns;privacy-preserving e-healthcare system;security analysis;security concerns;world healthcare applications","","","","","","","","1-4 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude. Finally, avenues for future research are discussed.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689164","(&#8220;IoT-SRUF: A Unifying Abstraction and Reasoning Framework for Connected and Unconnected Objects&#8221;) funded by the University of Padua.; Project IoT-SURF; 10.13039/100004358 - Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea, through the Global Research Outreach Program, project title: &#8220;Boosting Efficiency in Biometric Signal Processing for Smart Wearable Devices,&#8221;; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888991","Biomedical signal processing;energy efficiency;pattern recognition;signal compression;sparse autoencoders;wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices","","Internet of Things;body sensor networks;data compression;electrocardiography;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable computers","ECG;biosignal compression algorithms;e-health applications;health monitoring;lossy signal compression;photoplethysmographic signals;signal transmission;vital parameters;wearable Internet of Things devices","","1","","","","Traditional","20170329","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Melodia","Northeastern University, Boston, USA","IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications","20171005","2017","","","1","9","Wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative, sometimes revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications that can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implantable and wearable devices. We show that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power and mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers the gap in attenuation between 2.4 GHz RF and ultrasonic waves is still substantial, e.g., ultrasounds offer 70 dB less attenuation over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires much lower transmission power compared to 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability in tissues, e.g., 35 dBm lower over 12 cm for 10<sup>-3</sup> Bit Error Rate (BEr) leading to lower energy per bit and longer device lifetime. Finally, we show experimentally that 2.4 GHz RF links are not functional at all above 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10<sup>-6</sup> up to 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5336-0; POD:978-1-5090-5337-7","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057133","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057133","","Acoustics;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Implants;Radio frequency;Sensors;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;biomedical ultrasonics;error statistics;low-power electronics;prosthetics;ultrasonic transducers","Internet of Medical Things platform;IoMT platform;RF links;actuators;attenuation;dielectric nature;frequency 2.4 GHz;human body;implantable medical devices;intrabody communications;longer device lifetime;low-power ultrasonic platform;lower transmission power;mm-sized components;networked implantable devices;noise figure 70.0 dB;radio-frequency electromagnetic waves;revolutionary therapies;sensors;size 10.0 cm;size 12.0 cm;size 20.0 cm;software architecture;transmission power;ultrasonic connectivity;ultrasonic links;ultrasonic transducers the gap;ultrasonic waves;wearable devices;wirelessly networked systems","","","","","","","","1-4 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2708042","10.13039/100008982 - Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933942","Access control;implantable medical devices (IMDs);survey","Access control;Authentication;Communication system security;US Government agencies;Wireless communication","authorisation;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;message authentication;prosthetics","IMD access control schemes;IMD security;IMD threat model;authorized medical personnel;electronic devices;implantable medical devices;online authentication;zero power authentication","","","","","","Traditional","20170525","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2441720","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7174983","E-health;Nash equilibrium;game theory;mobile hospital;power control","Electromagnetic interference;Games;Hospitals;Mobile handsets;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;channel capacity;electromagnetic interference;game theory;health care;hospitals;medical computing;mobile computing","EMI;Internet of vehicles;best-response-dynamics algorithm;channel capacity;e-health applications;electromagnetic interference;mobile hospital;network-level optimal capacity;noncooperative game theoretic framework;power control algorithm","","1","","","","Traditional","20150803","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The system uses wireless signals to estimate calorie burned by the walking and localization. In addition, it also uses wireless motion sensors to recognize physical activity, such as drinking and restroom activity. Overall, the system can be divided into four parts: wearable device, gateway, cloud server, and caregiver's android application. The algorithms we proposed for drinking activity are Decision Tree (J48) and Random Forest (RF). While for restroom activity, we proposed supervised Reduced Error Pruning (REP) Tree and Variable Order Hidden Markov Model (VOHMM).

In the last ten years, high-end machinery has evolved primarily to the benefit of larger corporations, with the introduction of satellite driven machines, sensors and all components of precision farming. The most recent IoT advances bring about a level of simplification and cost reduction that enable all farmers to benefit and a true adoption of prescription agriculture. In this conference presentation, we will examine a practical case of a Malthouse, where careful modeling of how CO2, Temperature, Humidity and PH vary in the three steps of the malting process, enabled an artificial intelligence system to prescribe different setting and schedules. The end result is malt with higher content of starch and proteins, which in turn means higher alcohol in the downstream process.

Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2602823","Fundamental Science Projects of Shenzhen City; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; Projects of Guangdong R/D Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552528","Color angular pattern;PCANet;color histopathological image;color norm pattern;matrix-form classifier;random binary hashing","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image classification;Image color analysis;Principal component analysis","image classification;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;principal component analysis","C-RBH-PCANet algorithm;angular pattern;color channels;color norm pattern;color pattern random binary hashing-based PCaNet;computer-aided diagnosis;deep learning algorithm;feature learning;histopathological image classification;matrix-form classifier;multiple binary images;principal component analysis network","","6","","","","Traditional","20160825","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Cloud computing offered elastic and on-demand computing power able to host and support crucial IoT functions. However, the proliferation of connected objects poses the problem of the confidentiality of the data produced. This proliferation also threatens the performances of the supporting networks. To tackle those problems, the research community has recently turned to Fog Computing. In this paper, we present CIoud4IoT, a platform able to perform horizontal (roaming) and vertical (offloading) migration of IoT functions. We implement our demonstration using a Kubernetes cIuster organised in three tiers: Cloud, Edge and IoT gateways. Our first use cases shows how IoT function roaming can be used in the context of health care data exploitation. The second use case exploits the IoT offloading capacity of our platform to optimize the remote diagnostic of mechanical engines.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5873-0; POD:978-1-5090-5874-7","10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016218","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8016218","Docker;Edge CIoud;Fog Computing;Internet of Things;Kubernetes;Linux container;Open-Stack;Orchestrator;PaaS","Cloud computing;Containers;Edge computing;Engines;Internet of Things;Logic gates;Medical services","Internet of Things;Linux;cloud computing","CIoud4IoT;Fog Computing;IoT context;IoT function roaming;IoT gateways;IoT offloading capacity;cloud computing;edge computing;health care data exploitation;horizontal Linux container migration;mechanical engines;on-demand computing power;vertical Linux container migration","","","","","","","","6-9 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Regret minimization based adaptation of the energy detection threshold in body area networks","V. Marbukh; K.

Medical applications impose stringent requirements on BAN Quality of Service (QoS), including reliability and on-time availability of the sensors data. However, interference from other co-located BANs or other nearby devices sharing the same spectrum may cause unacceptable QoS degradation. The impact of such degradations can be minimized by using adaptive schemes that intelligently adjust relevant parameters at the transmitting or receiving nodes of a BAN. This paper provides a framework for low complexity regret minimization based algorithms for Energy Detection Threshold (EDT) adaptation in the transmitter node of a BAN. The nodes are assumed to be using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol according to the IEEE 802.15.6 BAN standard. Our preliminary simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of our algorithm compared to using a fixed EDT, and thus warrant future efforts in the adaptive EDT optimization as a mechanism to maintain QoS in various interference scenarios.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5873-0; POD:978-1-5090-5874-7","10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016231","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8016231","CSMA;body area network;energy detection threshold;interference mitigation","IEEE 802.15 Standard;Interference;Receivers;Sensors;Simulation;Transmitters","body area networks;carrier sense multiple access;minimisation;protocols;quality of service;radio spectrum management;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network reliability","BAN quality of service;CSMA/CA protocol;EDT;IEEE802.15.6;QoS;body area networks;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance protocol;energy detection threshold;implantable sensors;radio interface standard;regret minimization based adaptation;wearable sensors","","","","","","","","6-9 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3035-8; POD:978-1-5386-3036-5","10.1109/CBI.2017.34","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010750","Assisted Living;Dementia care;Internet of Things;Multicriteria evaluation;e-Health","Dementia;Industries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;analytic hierarchy process;diseases;health care","AHP;Internet of Things;IoT;analytic hierarchy process;chronic diseases;dementia care;health care services;multicriteria evaluation;special needs","","","","","","","","24-27 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4722-2; POD:978-1-5090-4723-9; USB:978-1-5090-4721-5","10.1109/CHASE.2017.66","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010621","","Data privacy;Databases;Encryption;Medical services;Servers;Speech recognition","Internet of Things;cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition","background sound;caregiver queries;disabled people;elderly;encrypted voice data;healthcare systems;homomorphic encryption;in-home IoT devices;in-home healthcare applications;mHealth data;mood;patients;privacy-preserving voice-based search;smart personal assistants;speech recognition;tone;voice content;voice data privacy;voice feature similarity;voice recording;voice upload;voice-enabled feature","","","","","","","","17-19 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications.

Based on heart beat we can predict whether a person is in Stress or not. Stress is one of the main factors that are affecting millions of lives. Thus, it is important to inform the person about his unhealthy life style and even alarm him/her before any acute condition occurs. To detect the stress beforehand we have used heart beat rate as one of the parameters. Internet of Things (IoT) along with Machine Learning (ML) is used to alarm the situation when the person is in real risk. ML is used to predict the condition of the patient and IoT is used to communicate the patience about his/her acute stress condition.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3893-4; POD:978-1-5386-1534-8","10.1109/ICCSA.2017.8000018","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000018","IoT;ML;Stress;heart beat rate","Heart beat;Logistics;Servers;Stress;Support vector machines;Training","Internet of Things;cardiology;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing","Internet of Things;IoT;ML;acute stress condition;cardiac surgeon;heart rate;machine learning;person heart beat;stress detection;stress prediction;unhealthy life style","","","","","","","","3-6 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative.

This study uses the Webduino module installed in SPB to achieve two-way messaging with remote relatives via internet of thing (IoT). The module first reads the sensing signal in the kit and uses WiFi to transmit the signal to WiFi Router, and then sends the medication information to a remote webpage or cell phone for monitoring (on LCD). Remote relatives can input care messages on the webpage or mobile phone to send a signal back to the WiFi Router and then to Webduino module. After receiving the signal, Webduino will send it to Arduino for text display and voice playback in the SPB. Therefore, the elderly staying in their home or nursing home institution can easily manage their medication via this application.

Throughput, latency reduction, availability and reliability are elemental attributes of experientially attractive and robust mobile multimedia services. These elemental attributes drive the demand for spectrum. The use of E-UTRA (Enhanced-Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) technologies, specified under the LTE project, over the 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum, is being considered as a forward-looking approach for standardization to meet the growing capacity demands to support mobile multimedia services. The 5 GHz spectrum band also includes the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, which is utilized by the IEEE 802 family of technologies. LAA (license assisted access) refers to the use of LTE technologies over unlicensed spectrum, with assistance using a licensed radio frequency carrier. A significant challenge in the standardization of LAA for interoperability is the management of co-channel and adjacent channel interference, when both E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies share the same unlicensed spectrum. These challenges are compounded by the differences in the regulations across the three different global ITU (International Telecommunication Union) regions (Europe, Americas, and Asia.) This article will identify strategies and corresponding trade-offs to mitigate the coexistence challenges between the E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies, utilizing forward-looking and interoperable enablers. In conclusion, the article will delineate recommendations for a realization of CA (carrier aggregation) between licensed and unlicensed spectrum for downlink and uplink, to accomplish deployment-specific capacity enhancements.","2471-2825;24712825","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1500714","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992940","","Downlink;Interference;Interoperability;Long Term Evolution;Throughput;Uplink;Wireless fidelity","Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;adjacent channel interference;cochannel interference;radio spectrum management","CA;E-UTRA technology;ISM band;Internet of Everything;IoE;LAA;LTE project;adjacent channel interference;carrier aggregation;co-channel interference;deployment-specific capacity enhancement;enhanced-universal terrestrial radio access technology;frequency 5 GHz;industrial scientific and medical band;interoperability;license assisted access;license-assisted access consideration;licensed radio frequency carrier;licensed spectrum;mobile multimedia services;unlicensed spectrum","","","","","","","","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively.

The ability of IoT that offers distinct technologies for a small constrained device to collect and deliver messages across sophisticated networks leaves room for more exploration. Zeroing down to the healthcare sector, a couple of Personal Health Devices (PHDs) have been developed to collect and share information across the internet. One Machine to Machine (oneM2M), ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD are some of the healthcare standards that have been developed have been developed to deal with the issue of interoperability in the IoT. In this paper we design and implement an interoperable messaging system that is based on international standards for IoT healthcare services. Standard IoT protocols; Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are some of the protocols that were designed to be used in an IoT environment. We designed and implemented a message system using CoAP following international standards for IoT healthcare services. This is due to better performance that CoAP offers in a constrained environment over other protocols. The paper further analyses and evaluates a comparative performance of number of packets transmitted in a transaction and packet loss rate number during transmission between the designed system and existing messaging system that uses MQTT.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6196-9; POD:978-1-5090-6197-6","10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983080","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7983080","CoAP;ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD;IoT;MQTT;PHD;oneM2M","IEEE Standards;ISO Standards;Medical services;Protocols;Quality of service;Reliability","IEEE standards;ISO standards;Internet of Things;biomedical telemetry;electronic data interchange;health care;medical information systems;open systems;queueing theory","CoAP;Constrained Application Protocol;ISO-IEEE 11073 PHD;Internet of Things;IoT environment;IoT healthcare services;MQTT;Message Queuing Telemetry Transport;Personal Health Devices;actuators;connected healthcare;connected homes;connected transport;constrained environment;data exchange;healthcare sector;healthcare standards;international standards;interoperability;interoperable messaging system;message system;network connectivity;one Machine to Machine;oneM2M;packet loss rate number;sensors;small constrained device;smart cities;standard IoT protocols","","","","","","","","8-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks. We evaluated both protocols through a specific e-health scenario. Tests revealed the usage of mobile networks increases response time and overhead of both protocols, on average, when compared to traditional networks.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6196-9; POD:978-1-5090-6197-6","10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983155","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7983155","","Authentication;Middleware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Time factors","Internet of Things;computer network security;health care;medical computing;middleware;protocols;radiocommunication","DTLS protocols;Internet of Things;IoT applications;IoT middleware systems;IoT systems;TLS protocols;communication layer;communication services;e-health applications;e-health environment;mobile networks;network latency;packet loss","","","","","","","","8-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As connected IoT devices have enhanced smart home, connected smart homes are expected to grow into smart community. However, several previous studies about smart community require a remote central server and do not consider local collaboration based on local direct communication networks. This paper proposes home-to-home (H2H) communication based on wireless communication between homes in a local community. Several types of local collaborations are described. Two plausible H2H communication architectures are presented such as centralized and distributed. Two architectures are evaluated using two metrics: traffic volume and communication reliability. Clustering is also adopted to reduce traffic volume. The evaluation results show that the centralized architecture is superior in traffic volume and it is more adequate for all-to-all type of local collaboration such as information sharing; that the distributed architecture is superior in communication reliability and it is more adequate for one-to-all type of local collaboration such as safety and security. Clustering greatly reduces traffic volumes. Therefore, the proposed H2H communications will provide more efficient communication and more reliable services under the circumstances of IoT-enabled smart homes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6196-9; POD:978-1-5090-6197-6","10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983222","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7983222","Internet of Things;Local Collaboration;Smart Community;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor Network","Base stations;Collaboration;Medical services;Mercury (metals);Monitoring;Safety;Smart homes","Internet of Things;home computing;telecommunication traffic","Internet of Things;communication reliability;connected IoT devices;connected smart homes;distributed architecture;home-to-home communications;local direct communication networks;plausible H2H communication architectures;remote central server;smart community;traffic volume;wireless communication","","","","","","","","8-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, deployed tactical networks face several challenges to connect intervening teams. To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In our recent works, a new routing protocol called ORACE-Net was proposed, evaluated and compared to the existing approaches. ORACE-Net aims to create a tactical Internet of Humans (IoH) emergency network. ORACE-Net is implemented on mobile devices and evaluated within realistic conditions.

Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers. In addition, the system can represent the collected data in useful ways, perform automatic decision making and provide many advanced services such as real-time notifications for immediate attention.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4372-9; POD:978-1-5090-4373-6","10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986551","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7986551","Internet-of-Things;energy-efficient;fog computing;health monitoring;low energy;low-cost;wearable","Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;diseases;electrocardiography;health care;internetworking;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","ECG;Internet of Things;automatic decision making;body temperature;cardiomyopathy;continuous remote monitoring;coronary artery disease;electrocardiography;energy-efficient sensor nodes;heart attack;heart condition monitoring;heart diseases;heart muscle disease;heart rate irregularity;low-cost fog-assisted health-care IoT system;low-cost health monitoring system;real-time analysis;real-time monitoring;real-time notifications;respiration rate;smart gateway;wireless transmission","","","","","","","","26-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, MAS research generally lacks an adequate understanding of modern distributed computing. In this Blue Sky paper, we envision decentralized multiagent systems as a way to place decentralized intelligence in distributed computing, specifically, by supporting computation at the level of social meanings. We motivate our proposals for research in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has become a major thrust in distributed computing. From the IoT's representative applications, we abstract out the major challenges of relevance to decentralized intelligence. These include the heterogeneity of IoT components; asynchronous and delay-tolerant communication and decoupled enactment; and multiple stakeholders with subtle requirements for governance, incorporating resource usage, cooperation, and privacy. The IoT yields high-impact problems that require solutions that go beyond traditional ways of thinking.

Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users.

However, these networks face many challenges, such as high path loss, limited available bandwidth, limited battery power, and high attenuation. For a longer network lifetime, both balanced and efficient energy consumption are equally important. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, called balanced energy adaptive routing (BEAR), to prolong the lifetime of UWSNs. The proposed BEAR protocol operates in three phases: 1) initialization phase; 2) tree construction phase; and 3) data transmission phase. In the initialization phase, all nodes share information related to their residual energy level and location. In the tree construction phase, our proposed BEAR exploits the location information for: a) selecting neighbour nodes and b) choosing the facilitating and successor nodes based on the value of cost function. In order to balance the energy consumption among the successor and the facilitator nodes, BEAR chooses nodes with relatively higher residual energy than the average residual energy of the network. The results of our extensive simulations show that BEAR outperforms its counterpart protocols in terms of network lifetime.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2706741","10.13039/501100002383 - International Scientific Partnership Program through King Saud University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932058","IoT;energy balancing;tree construction;underwater wireless sensor network","Distributed Bragg reflectors;Energy consumption;Reliability;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","Internet of Things;energy consumption;marine communication;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","BEAR protocol;Internet of Things;IoT enabling underwater WSN;UWSN;balanced energy adaptive routing protocol;balanced energy consumption;cost function;data transmission phase;environmental monitoring;facilitator nodes;geological processes;initialization phase;neighbour nodes;ocean floor;prolonged network lifetime;residual energy level;successor nodes;tree construction phase;underwater wireless sensor networks","","","","","","OAPA","20170519","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Bitstring and key generation implemented with Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs can further reduce resource utilization for authentication and encryption operations and reduce overall system cost by eliminating on-chip non-volatile-memory (NVM). In this paper, we propose a dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) strategy for implementing both authentication and encryption using a PUF for bitstring and key generation on FPGAs as a means of optimizing the utilization of the limited area resources.

We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4117-6; POD:978-1-5090-4118-3; USB:978-1-5090-4116-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7952278","Data-driven compressive sensing;Internet of things (IoT);mobile healthcare;wearable sensing","Biomedical monitoring;Dictionaries;Physiology;Sensors;Sparse matrices;Training;Wireless communication","compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction","ECG signals;compression ratio;cotraining approach;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;isometry property;long-term health monitoring;personalized features;physiologic signals;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;sensing matrix;signal characteristics;signal sparsity","","","","","","","","5-9 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, a sparse spatial filter is achieved by minimizing the l<sub>1</sub>-norm of filter coefficients and channels of EEG signals can be further optimized.

Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth<sup>1</sup>, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using - n inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6517-2; POD:978-1-5090-6518-9","10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947025","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947025","","Air quality;Humidity;Medical services;Monitoring;Pediatrics;Sensors;Temperature measurement","Internet of Things;diseases;electronic health records;mobile computing;paediatrics;patient monitoring","EMR;asthma control level;asthma management;children;continuous patient monitoring;electronic medical records;kHealth framework;multimodal IoT;multimodal data processing;smart health application;vulnerability score","","","","","","","","29-31 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While various techniques have been used for dietary monitoring in clinical trials and user studies, they are not ready for daily use. Existing solutions either require tedious manual recording or may impede normal daily activities. In this paper, a pair of diet-aware glasses is designed. The key idea here is that when people wear glasses, the temples of the glasses are in touch with the lower part of the temporalis muscle, one of the mastication muscles. By integrating an electromyography (EMG) sensor into glasses, the glasses can measure the muscle activity of the temporalis to detect intake-related events. This paper instantiates the idea by building a prototype equipped with an EMG sensor, a microcontroller, SD shield/card and a Bluetooth radio. When working together with a smartphone, the glasses can provide detailed information on intake schedule, the number of chewing cycles and broad food category. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven subjects and the results show appealing prospects for our diet-aware glasses.

Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose a- innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing.

We challenge this retraining model by stimulating the vision of autonomous learning with the goal of eliminating the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly expensive process of collecting labeled training data in dynamic environments. We propose an approach for autonomous retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any new labeled training data. We focus on a dynamic setting where new sensors are added to the system and worn on various body locations. We capture the inherent correlation between observations made by a static sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new dynamic sensor views for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our realtime dynamic-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an average accuracy of 81.1% in activity recognition using three experimental datasets. This amount of accuracy represents more than 13.8% improvement in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the sensor data in the newly added sensor.

Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles.

The subprojects of platform are: a) wheelchair with automatic elevation; b) lift system for sustain patients during movements and daily activities; and c) physical therapy assistant with variable load. Each subproject has local control systems. This work presents an integrated supervisory system with three layers to control RPAT based on Internet of Things. A first simplified prototype was assembled with a simple Arduino controller to analyze the compatibility between software implemented in C# and SQL. The language was chosen to promote usability and database storage robustness. Parameters like response and usability were evaluated and results were considered satisfactory in terms of compatibility between the local control and the supervisory control.

Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices.

However, the proliferation of wireless devices in industrial applications makes the spectrum sharing in limited industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band a challenging problem. In this paper, it is concerned with the intrinsic impact of the evenness of spectrum usage on the spectrum sharing performance in terms of channel accessing probability, spectrum utilization, and fairness of spectrum usage. In order to explore the explicit relationship between the evenness and spectrum sharing performance, a new concept of equilibrium is first defined to represent the achievable best evenness of spectrum usage. Then, a set of rules called local equilibrium-guided autonomous channel switching (LEQ-AutoCS) is devised, with which each accessed sensor autonomously equalizes the local channel occupations within its range of spectrum sensing without overhead on exchanging the sensors' spectrum sensing reports. It is further proved that the equilibrium can be achieved by this concessive manner. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LEQ-AutoCS rules provide higher utilization and fairness of spectrum usage comparing to the existing spectrum access approaches. Moreover, it is shown that LEQ-AutoCS rules assist the system to reduce the spectrum access delay to 1/2 of CSMA-based systems and 1/50 of TDMA-based systems, respectively.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2490544","10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation (NSF) of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/501100003399 - Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM), China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7297795","Autonomous channel switching;Industrial wireless sensor networks;autonomous channel switching;equilibrium;industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs);spectrum sharing","Delays;Industries;Internet of things;Sensors;Switches;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","carrier sense multiple access;probability;radio spectrum management;signal detection;time division multiple access;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","CSMA-based system;ISM band;IWSN;LEQ-AutoCS;TDMA-based system;channel accessing probability;industrial scientific and medical band;industrial wireless sensor network;industry automation;local equilibrium-guided autonomous channel switching;production efficiency improvement;spectrum access delay reduction;spectrum sensing;spectrum sharing efficiency;spectrum usage evenness;spectrum usage fairness;spectrum utilization;wireless device proliferation","","4","","30","","","20151013","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Three of the four comparison methods are based on the well known, classical batch k-means model. Specifically, we use k-means, single pass k-means, online k-means, and clustering using representatives (CURE) for numerical comparisons. clusiVAT is based on sampling the data, imaging the reordered distance matrix to estimate the number of clusters in the data visually, clustering the samples using a relative of single linkage (SL), and then noniteratively extending the labels to the rest of the data-set using the nearest prototype rule. Previous work has established that clusiVAT produces true SL clusters in compact-separated data. We have performed experiments to show that k-means and its modified algorithms suffer from initialization issues that cause many failures. On the other hand, clusiVAT needs no initialization, and almost always finds partitions that accurately match ground truth labels in labeled data. CURE also finds SL type partitions but is much slower than the other four algorithms. In our experiments, clusiVAT proves to be the fastest and most accurate of the five algorithms; e.g., it recovers 97% of the ground truth labels in the real world KDD-99 cup data (4292637 samples in 41 dimensions) in 76 s.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2477416","10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council (ARC) Research Network on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing under REDUCE through the Digital Economy Programme run by Research Councils U.K.¿a cross council initiative led by EPSRC and contributed to by Arts and Humanities Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Medical Research Council; and ARC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7283582","Big data cluster analysis;Internet of things;cluster tendency assessment;data analytics;single linkage","Algorithm design and analysis;Big data;Clustering algorithms;Cybernetics;Image edge detection;Indexes;Partitioning algorithms","Big Data;pattern clustering;visual databases","Big Data;CURE;SL type partitioning;batch k-means model;clusiVAT algorithm;clustering-using representatives;data clustering algorithm;data sampling;distance matrix;ground truth labels;hybrid approach;nearest prototype rule;noniterative data labelling;online-k-means;real world KDD-99 cup data;single linkage;single-pass k-means","","7","","","","","20150929","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the current multipath routing strategy may cause problem that the node energy near sink becomes obviously higher than other nodes which makes the network invalid and dead. It also has serious impact on the performance of wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). In this paper, we propose a pair-wise directional geographical routing (PWDGR) strategy to solve the energy bottleneck problem. First, the source node can send the data to the pair-wise node around the sink node in accordance with certain algorithm and then it will send the data to the sink node. These pair-wise nodes are equally selected in 360° scope around sink according to a certain algorithm. Therefore, it can effectively relieve the serious energy burden around Sink and also make a balance between energy consumption and end-to-end delay. Theoretical analysis and a lot of simulation experiments on PWDGR have been done and the results indicate that PWDGR is superior to the proposed strategies of the similar strategies both in the view of the theory and the results of those simulation experiments. With respect to the strategies of the same kind, PWDGR is able to prolong 70% network life.

To tackle this problem, we study how to learn the sensitivity of neurometric application fidelity to EEG data.

Indeed, very recently, bionic devices have been implanted inside a living human brain as innovative treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. In this context, this paper proposes a systems-theoretic communication model to capture the actual behavior of biological neurons. Specifically, biological neurons exhibit physical extension due to their projections called dendrites, which propagate the electrochemical stimulation received via synapses to the soma. Experimental evidences show that the dendrites exhibit two main features: 1) the compartmentalization at the level of the dendritic branches of the neuronal processes and 2) the location-dependent preference for different frequencies. Stemming from these experimental evidences, we propose to model the dendritic tree as a spatiotemporal filter bank, where each filter models the behavior in both space and time of a dendritic branch. Each filter is fully characterized along with the overall neuronal response. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on the incoming stimulus for inducing a null-neuronal response are derived. The conducted theoretical analysis shows that: 1) the neuronal information is encoded in the stimulus temporal pattern, i.e., it is possible to select the neuron to affect by changing the stimulus frequency content; in this sense, the communication among neurons is frequency-selective and 2) the spatial distribution of the dendrites affects the neuronal response; in this sense, the communication among neurons is spatial-selective. The theoretical analysis is validated through a real neuron morphology.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2438098","Campania POR project myOpenGov; Italian PON projects ¿SIRIO: Servizi per l¿Infrastruttura di Rete wIreless Oltre il 3G¿ and ¿FERSAT: studio di un sistema di segnalamento FERroviario basato sullinnovativo utilizzo delle tecnologie SATellitari e della loro integrazione con le tecnologie terrestri¿; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113778","Dendritic tree;Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT);IoNT;dendritic tree;intrabody networks;nanonetworks;receiver;spatial-frequency selectivity","Biological system modeling;Biomembranes;Cutoff frequency;Impedance;Nanobioscience;Neurons;Spatiotemporal phenomena","Internet of Things;brain;channel bank filters;medical computing;medical disorders;nanomedicine;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;spatiotemporal phenomena","Internet-of-NanoThings;biological neurons;bionic nervous system;dendritic processing power modeling;drug-resistant epilepsy;electrochemical stimulation;filter models;frequency-selective distribution;innovative treatment;intrabody nanonetworks;living human brain;location-dependent preference;medical diagnosis;nervous system monitoring;neuronal information;neuronal processes;null-neuronal response;physical extension;real neuron morphology;receiver design;soma synapses;spatial distribution;spatiotemporal filter bank;stimulus temporal pattern;systems-theoretic communication;theoretical analysis;treatment techniques","","5","","23","","","20150601","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, under intensive physical exercises, motion artifacts are strong interference sources for wrist-type photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor signals, thus significantly affecting the accurate estimation of heart rate and other physiological parameters. Currently, how to effectively remove the motion artifacts from PPG sensor signals is becoming an active and challenging research realm. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel spectral matrix decomposition (MC-SMD) model to accurately estimate heart rate in the presence of intensive physical activities. Motivated by the observation that the PPG signal spectrum and the acceleration spectrum have almost the same spectral peak positions in the frequency domain, we first model the removal of motion artifacts as a spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem. After removing motion artifacts, we propose a new spectral peak tracking method for estimating heart rate. Experimental results on the well-known PPG data sets recorded from 12 subjects during intensive movements demonstrate that MC-SMD can efficiently remove the motion artifacts and retrieve an accurate heart rate using multi-channel PPG sensor signals.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2580594","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; General Project of Scientific Research of the Education through the Department of Liaoning Province; State Scholarship Fund; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004731 - Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7494627","Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method;compressive sensing;heart rate measurement;photoplethysmography (PPG)","Acceleration;Estimation;Heart rate;Matrix decomposition;Sparse matrices;Tracking","Internet of Things;cardiology;frequency-domain analysis;intelligent sensors;matrix decomposition;medical signal processing;optimisation;photoplethysmography","Internet of Things;MC-SMD model;frequency domain;heart rate estimation;intelligent wearable heart rate measurement;intensive physical activity;multichannel PPG sensor signal;physiological parameter;spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem;spectral matrix decomposition-based motion artifact removal;spectral peak position;spectral peak tracking method;wrist-type photoplethysmography sensor signal","","10","","35","","OAPA","20160620","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546","Direcci¿n General de Investigaci¿n, Innovaci¿n y Postgrado of Federico Santa Mar¿a Technical University- Chile, in the Project Private and Secure Mobile Cloud Framework for Medical IoT Devices (UTFSM-DGIP 116.23.3); 10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea Funded by the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805329","Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy","Cloud computing;Data models;Data privacy;Internet of things;Logic gates;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Privacy","cloud computing;health care;middleware","Internet of Healthcare Things;IoHT devices;OECD privacy principles;accountability act;automated compliance;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;cloud-based healthcare services;concealment process;distributed data collection protocol;fog based middleware;health data;health insurance portability;healthcare Web services;healthcare data;healthcare delivery;healthcare provider;healthcare things;holistic privacy middleware;hospital setting;intensive privacy preserving processes;living organism;personal gateways;personal health information;personalized health insights;privacy laws;privacy regulation frameworks;sensitive health information","","2","","","","OAPA","","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2377238","(FP7/2007-2013); European Community¿s; 10.13039/501100001602 - Science Foundation Ireland (SFI); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6981909","Activity classification;Biomechanics;Curve shift registration;Knee joint angle;Sensor fusion;Smart and connected health;Technique assessment;Wearable inertial sensor;biomechanics;curve shift registration;knee joint angle;sensor fusion;smart and connected health;technique assessment;wearable inertial sensor","Accelerometers;Biomedical monitoring;Discrete wavelet transforms;Injuries;Intelligent sensors;Medical devices;Medical services;Motion control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","discrete wavelet transforms;gradient methods;medical signal processing;signal classification;sport","DWT;automatic activity classification;computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm;curve-shift registration technique;discrete wavelet transform;motion analysis technologies;movement assessment;random forest classifier;sports training session;wearable inertial sensors","","12","","51","","","20141210","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2680467","10.13039/501100002383 - Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Research Group; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875175","GMM;Smart cities;health monitoring;liner prediction;voice disorders","Acoustics;Feature extraction;Medical services;Monitoring;Senior citizens;Smart cities;Speech","Internet of Things;cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;patient monitoring;signal detection;smart cities;speech processing","Internet of Things;automatic health monitoring system;automatic voice disorder detection system;cloud computing;elderly people;energy distribution;frequency 1 Hz to 1562 Hz;healthcare resources;linear prediction analysis;running speech;smart cities;smart healthcare systems;smart technologies;source signal;sustained vowel;voice complications","","1","","","","OAPA","20170309","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It remains an open problem to simultaneously achieve device authentication and fast secret key extraction merely using wireless physical layer characteristics, without the help of advanced hardware or out-of-band channel. In this paper, we answer this open problem in the setting of wireless body area networks (BANs). We propose MASK-BAN, a lightweight fast authenticated secret key extraction scheme for intra-BAN communication. Our scheme neither introduces advanced hardware nor relies on out-of-band channels. To perform device authentication and fast secret key extraction at the same time, we exploit the heterogeneous channel characteristics among the collection of on-body channels during body motion. On one hand, MASK-BAN achieves authentication through multihop stable channels, which greatly reduces the false positive rate as compared to existing work. On the other hand, based on dynamic channels, key extraction between two on-body devices with multihop relay nodes is modeled as a max-flow problem, and a novel collaborative secret key generation algorithm is introduced to maximize the key generation rate. Extensive real-world experiments on low-end commercial-off-the-shelf sensor devices validate MASK-BAN's great authentication capability and high-secret key generation rate.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2391113","10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation (NSF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006641","Authenticated key generation;physical layer;received signal strength (RSS);sensor;wireless body area network (WBAN)","Authentication;Biomedical monitoring;Communication system security;Intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;Medical devices;Medical services;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","body area networks;private key cryptography;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication security;wireless channels","MASK-BAN;body area networks;body motion;device authentication;intra-BAN communication;movement-aided authenticated secret key extraction;on-body channels;out-of-band channels;relay nodes;wireless network security schemes;wireless physical layer characteristics","","6","","36","","","20150112","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N).

The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2600633","Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education; Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Nature Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002865 - Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing Science and Technology Commission; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546882","I.I.D. multi-armed bandit;channel-grouping;fairness access scheme;modified UCB-tuned","Agriculture;Cognitive radio;Internet of things;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cognitive radio;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;cognitive radio technology;distributed learning algorithm;fair channel-grouping scheme;multi armed bandit channel access scheme;spectrum scarcity problem;water-filling principle;wireless sensor networks","","10","","","","OAPA","20160817","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sometimes, it is necessary to make dynamic updates to the hierarchy, in order to implement an access control policy which evolves with time. All security models for hierarchical key assignment schemes have been designed to cope with static hierarchies and do not consider the issue of performing dynamic updates to the hierarchy. In this paper, we define the concept of hierarchical key assignment schemes supporting dynamic updates, formalizing the relative security model. In particular, we provide the notion of security with respect to key indistinguishability, by considering the dynamic changes to the hierarchy. Moreover, we show how to construct a hierarchical key assignment scheme supporting dynamic updates, by using as a building block a symmetric encryption scheme. The proposed construction is provably secure with respect to key indistinguishability, and provides efficient key derivation and updating procedures, while requiring each user to store only a single private key.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2581147","CICAEET fund; Distinguished Young Scholars Fund of Fujian; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research through the GenData 2020 Project; PAPD fund; Program for New Century Excellent Talents through Fujian University; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492252","Access control;adaptive adversary;dynamic structures;key assignment;provable security","Access control;Context;Encryption;Internet of things;Medical services;Sensors","authorisation;private key cryptography","cryptographic hierarchical access control;dynamic structures;dynamic updates;encryption keys;hierarchical key assignment scheme;key derivation;key indistinguishability;private information;relative security model;static hierarchies;symmetric encryption scheme","","10","","","","","20160615","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we study the problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly N ≥ 3) exponential signals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor structure and the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of Hankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonance spectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover full signals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2017.2695566","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hong Kong Research Grant Council; Important Joint Research Project on Major Diseases of Xiamen City; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003392 - Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7903737","Hankel matrix;NMR;Tensor completion;exponential signal;low rank;spectroscopy","Compressed sensing;Frequency-domain analysis;Image reconstruction;Minimization;Nuclear magnetic resonance;Spectroscopy;Tensile stress","biomedical MRI;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;signal reconstruction","Hankel matrix nuclear norm regularized tensor completion;data acquisition;low-rank tensor completion problem;magnetic resonance spectroscopy data;n-dimensional exponential signals;signal reconstruction","","3","","","","","20170418","July15, 15 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties.

In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists.

A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues.

IoT for health sector in Indonesia is used to improve health services based on telemedicine services roadmap by Indonesian Ministry of Health. This services include teleECG, teleRadiology and teleUSG which utilize mobile technology. In Indonesia, there is a tendency that IoT will be implemented on a large scale. Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to experience deficiency of 500 MHz mobile spectrum in 2020. Therefore, the calculation of spectrum for telemedicine services is urgently needed. This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia. The government of Indonesia should prepare about strategic spectrum management to anticipate the massive growing of IoT application, such as a roadmap of IoT development and a regulation of specific frequency in the nearest future.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5431-2; POD:978-1-5090-5432-9; USB:978-1-5090-5430-5","10.1109/ISTT.2016.7918096","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918096","Indonesia;IoT;LTE;Spectrum needs;health;telemedicine services","Broadband communication;Long Term Evolution;Mathematical model;Medical diagnostic imaging;Mobile communication;Telemedicine","Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;biomedical communication;health care;telecommunication network management","Indonesia;Indonesian Ministry of Health;Internet of Things;IoT health sector;general LTE planning equation;health services;mobile technology;spectrum requirement;telemedicine services;telemedicine services roadmap","","","","","","","","28-30 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.33","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917061","Cloud;Elasticity;Hospitals;Performance","Cloud computing;Databases;Elasticity;Hospitals;Radiofrequency identification","Web services;biomedical equipment;client-server systems;cloud computing;decision making;health care;medical information systems;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;virtual machines","EMH model;RFID;centralized management control center;client-server Web service;cloud elasticity facility;distributed framework;elastic multihospital management model;health equipments;medical treatment;motion detection;multihospital environments;multiple healthcare institutions;object elastic management;physical space elastic management;radio-frequency identification sensor tracking technology;real-time decision making;virtual machines","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario","P.

In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5256-1; POD:978-1-5090-5257-8; USB:978-1-5090-5255-4","10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917942","Authorization;IOT;Json Web Token;OAuth 2.0","Authentication;Authorization;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Real-time systems;Servers","Internet;Internet of Things;application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;open systems;real-time systems","IoT cloud scenario;JSON Web token;OAuth 2.0;authorization framework;automatic monthly payments;bank account;interoperable API;phishing attack;real time clinical care;secure health care services","","","","","","","","14-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The diseases which include various ailments in the form of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. These diseases are the main cause of hospitalization for elder people. People who have suffered from chronic diseases are needed to repeatedly monitor the vital signs periodically. The vital signs are the basic measurements of body functions. The vital signs of our body are heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood glucose level. The respiratory rate monitor is one of the important vital signs which is useful for patient's who admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The respiratory rate is calculated by using LM35 temperature sensor and monitored the patient's respiration continuously based on voltage value of inhaled and exhaled air. NRF24l01 is used to transmit the sensor data from home to medical center. Then the data are published in a webserver using Ethernet to know the patient's status which is useful for doctor.

By employing real-time e-health monitoring systems for acquiring, and analyzing bio-signals by measurements such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), it is possible to extract information to achieve better health-care in terms of observation, diagnosis, and treatment. However, those systems are limited in acquiring and sending data at high rates, are not energy efficient, or, are restricted in terms of portability due to large size and weight. In this paper, a compact portable bio-signal acquisition device for wearables has been designed and implemented. The developed hardware is capable of acquiring and reliably sending the data wirelessly at a high transfer rate in real-time while keeping the overall energy consumption low. Finally, the signal acquisition performance of the device has been evaluated for both ECG and EMG at 8 channel 24 bit resolution/channel 500 samples/s configuration.

IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework.

The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position.

We can get the latent semantic relations between words and words in the corpus. And then combining the information entropy and word frequency, we can find new words.

By using ISODC clustering search decision-making ability, the best threshold value is obtained. ISODC can solve the dilemma that PCNN needs to determine appropriate model parameters and circulation iterations. ISODC-PCNN makes use of the grey level of the image to cluster, and then uses the improved ISODATA to determine the initial number and the center of clustering which can be used as the optimal threshold value of PCNN. Therefore ISODC-PCNN can automatically segment an image with one time of iteration.

Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly.

Segmentation depicts how the object is composed in an image and aids in extracting useful information from it so that interpretation becomes easier. Segmentation may be regarded as an essential pre-processing stage that will help to acquire objects that can be efficiently utilized in further steps of processing. This extraction of objects is helpful in almost every field today such as medical, forensic, industry and agriculture. Instead of using pixels, DWT make use of waves that helps to extract object efficiently. To raise the segmentation accuracy further an improved Fuzzy-C Mean with Edge and Local Information (FELICM) based gray stretch strategy is suggested that will help to segment an image by obtaining an optimistic and adaptive threshold by incorporating FELICM and gray stretch on coefficients with low frequency and edge enhancement on coefficients with high frequency after DWT.

Brain tumor detection is one of the most widely used applications by vast researchers. In this paper a novel approach is presented for detection of affected mass (tumor) in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two level wavelet transform is used to decompose the brain image with mother wavelet `db6'. The horizontal, vertical and the diagonal components at both the levels are further decomposed to level five using histogram for each of the component using one dimensional wavelet transform. By finding global minima at level five, and then mapped at the component histogram, a threshold value is found out. The component then is thresholded using this adaptive threshold. The original image is then reconstructed with the obtained components using this course segmentation. The approximation component at level one is unaltered. Lastly a windowing technique is used to eliminate the false detection due to light in-homogeneity or due to hard tissues, which uses a window based threshold. Results after fine segmentation showed that normal patient images showed complete black region in the final segmented image whereas malignant images showed the region of interest after segmentation. The MRI images from a research institute were obtained and the results after segmentation were validated from an expert from the same research institute.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2612-8; POD:978-1-5090-2613-5","10.1109/INCITE.2016.7857627","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857627","Magnetic resonance images;adaptive threshold;course segmentation;fine segmentation;global minima;wavelet transform;windowing technique","Histograms;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Tumors;Wavelet transforms","approximation theory;biomedical MRI;diseases;image reconstruction;image resolution;image segmentation;medical image processing;tumours;wavelet transforms","MRI images;adaptive wavelet based histogram thresholding;affected mass detection;black region;brain tumor pixel detection;course segmentation;diagonal components;fine windowing;hard tissues;horizontal components;image processing;magnetic resonance images;malignant images;medical applications;medical images;mother wavelet;one-dimensional wavelet transform;two-level wavelet transform;vertical components","","1","","","","","","6-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blood sugar level of body is a very important factor for health and it should be maintain within the desired level or else this would result in complications and often serious damage to the body. Therefore treatment must be provided in case of high or low blood sugar level. In case of high blood sugar level, insulin must be injected and in case of low blood sugar level we should inject glucagon into the body. This paper is concerned on advanced method of simulation that can be used to implement a real insulin and glucagon pump that can work in real time to prevent the fatal effects of diabetes on body. This system also covers all the safety critical system aspect required to build a system that has a direct effect on human life. To provide better insulin and glucagon management and to reduce the need for human supervision, we have implement a control algorithm for the insulin and glucagon pump to automate the delivery process. The control algorithm adapts the glucose metabolic rate and determine the appropriate amount of insulin or glucagon to be delivered into the body. Method that is followed is effective and efficient in maintaining the blood sugar level. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system is very easy and user friendly that makes it easier for the patient and doctor to use.

This is because packets missing their deadlines would become useless and are frequently dropped, which seriously degrade the quality of service (QoS). As the utilization of Internet of Things has become mature, multimedia data transmission is a key component to promote the QoS of citizens. To fulfill the QoS requirement in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with multimedia content, the combination of multiple transmission methods is encouraged for packet forwarding, including conventional network coding, analog network coding, plain routing, and direct transmission (i.e., no-relaying, NR). The diversity of transmission method is helpful to lower packet dropping probability, while complicating the packet transmitting and scheduling process instead. Therefore, we first introduce an exhaustive search method to obtain the optimal scheduling sequence and corresponding transmission method for deadline constrained multimedia transmissions in WSNs. With the objective of promoting computing efficiency for the formulated problem, we then propose two heuristic methods based on the Markov chain approximation and the dynamic graph, respectively. Simulation results illustrate that our methods can effectively reduce packet dropping probability and simulation time, so that QoS of individuals can be promoted.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2645709","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation Project; 10.13039/501100008048 - State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology within the Nanjing University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801019","QoS;adaptive transmission;packet dropping;scheduling","Delays;Multimedia communication;Quality of service;Scheduling;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;diversity reception;graph theory;multimedia communication;quality of service;search problems;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Markov chain approximation;QoS;analog network coding;deadline constrained packet scheduling;dynamic graph;exhaustive search method;heuristic methods;high efficiency resource allocation;multimedia data transmission;optimal scheduling sequence;packet forwarding;packet transmission;plain routing;quality of service;transmission method diversity;wireless multimedia sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","","2","","","","","20161228","March1, 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In ultrasound images, the diagnostic information is constrained to a particular region in the image, and sonographers look for that particular region for doing diagnosis. Therefore, by transmitting only that particular region to the remote sonographer, a significant compression can be achieved. Diagnostic information present in an image is organ specific, hence we came up with a framework to detect the organs and compress accordingly. We developed automated, semi-automated and manual algorithms for detecting the organs in an image. The automated and semi-automated algorithms for organ detection are based on Viola Jones and active shape model respectively. The detected organ is JPEG compressed and transmitted to remote sonographer through WebRTC technology. WebRTC enables direct browser-to-browser connection enabling fast and secure transmission of data. Organ detection algorithms are implemented through WebRTC and hence there is no need to install any softwares at the end devices. With the proposed framework, any ultrasound scanner can access service from the server, compress it and transmit to the expert end. The remote sonographer from anywhere can connect to the ultrasound scanner with his laptop, mobile, tablet etc., for doing diagnosis. The performance of proposed framework is evaluated by computing the compression efficiency on ten kidney ultrasound images.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7791-1; POD:978-1-4673-7792-8","10.1109/IECBES.2016.7843443","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7843443","","Image coding;Image segmentation;Kidney;Shape;Ultrasonic imaging;WebRTC","Internet of Things;biomedical telemetry;biomedical ultrasonics;data compression;image coding;kidney;medical image processing;security of data;telemedicine;ultrasonic imaging","IoT enabled telesonography;Viola Jones;WebRTC;active shape model;browser-to-browser connection;compressed JPEG;compression efficiency;data security transmission;diagnostic information;diagnostically driven compression algorithms;kidney ultrasound images;laptop;mobile phone;organ detection;organ detection algorithms;remote sonographer;semiautomated algorithms;specific organ image;tablet;ultrasound image compressing;ultrasound scanner","","1","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better.

However, such applications generate large amounts of real-time data in terms of volume, velocity, and variety thus making it a big data problem. Hence, the challenge is how to combine and analyse such data with historical patient data to obtain meaningful diagnoses suggestions within acceptable time frames (considering quality of service (QoS)). Despite the evolution of big data processing technologies (e.g. Hadoop) and scalable infrastructure (e.g. clouds), there remains a significant gap in the areas of heterogeneous data collection, real-time patient monitoring, and automated decision support (semantic reasoning) based on well-defined QoS constraints.

Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data. Generally, the presence of these problems in transmitting vital body signals may result in incorrect medical diagnosing which can increase mortality rate and cause severe impact to the overall system's performance.

This paper provides an overview of these advances. Also, we propose an IoT-based surveillance system for ubiquitous healthcare monitoring. The system consists of sensors, actuators, and cameras. Mesh topology was decided to be used as it provides important advantages. Moreover, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used for the data compression and transferring, and the Scalable High-Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) is used for the video compression and transferring. The SHVC can deliver the same video quality in half of the bit rate than the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Furthermore, cloud services are provided, such as storage and real-time monitoring. Finally, we made a comparative analysis between our proposed system architecture and two other approaches. From this analysis, we can say that our system architecture has some benefits instead of other similar architectures. Also, we made an analysis of the bandwidth and the network throughput. The results are significant since the bandwidth required for the transmission of data and video is reduced.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3474-1; POD:978-1-5090-3475-8","10.1109/IECON.2016.7793281","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7793281","6LoWPAN;Cloud Computing;Constrained Application Protocol;Healthcare;IPv6;Internet of Things;Scalable High-Efficiency Video Coding;Wireless Mesh Networks","Biomedical monitoring;Cameras;Indexes;Medical services;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cloud computing;data compression;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;telemedicine;video coding;video surveillance;wireless mesh networks","CoAP;Internet of Things;IoT-based surveillance system;SHVC;cloud computing;cloud services;constrained application protocol;data compression;data transferring;mesh topology;mobile devices;scalable high-efficiency video coding;ubiquitous healthcare monitoring;video compression;video transferring;wireless mesh network","","3","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1496-5; POD:978-1-5090-1497-2","10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777886","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777886","Android;Application;Applied engineering;Arduino;Bluetooth integration;Consumer electronics;Healthcare electronics;Internet of Things;Mechatronics;Medical electronics;Medication control;Medication scheduling;Microcontroller;Mobile computing;Patient care;Robotic and Autonomous systems;Wireless computing","Androids;Bluetooth;Consumer electronics;DC motors;Humanoid robots;Servomotors;Testing","Android (operating system);Bluetooth;biomedical electronics;computerised instrumentation;consumer electronics;drugs;microcontrollers","Android application;Arduino-controlled consumer device;HC-06 Bluetooth module;SMS notification;autonomous pill dispenser;pill diameter;pill type;serial activation signal;tablet medication delivery mechanization;textured cone","","","","","","","","20-22 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces a systematic infection detection framework utilizing mobile communication technologies including mobile networking and encounter statistics during infection breakouts. Our target environment is smart connected hospitals using Internet of things. First, the disease infection trace-back problem is defined. Then a detailed practical framework is devised using wireless encounters to facilitate the trace-back to the infection source and identify the population at risk; the nodes that are likely infected. Trace back and filtering methods are then proposed using probabilistic forward and backward search techniques. We use extensive WLAN campus traces of six buildings with different mobility characteristics and over 34K users to drive our simulations. Metrics of true positive, true negative, accuracy and coverage are measured and presented. Our results thus far show promise, where in most cases the accuracy of correctly selecting the infected nodes that have been in the area during the epidemic period were found to reach 70-80% with population selection coverage close to the infection percentage of nodes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0724-0; POD:978-1-5090-0725-7","10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763193","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763193","","Diseases;Hospitals;Mobile communication;Sensors;Sociology;Statistics;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;diseases;hospitals;medical computing;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Internet-of-things;WLAN campus trace;backward search technique;disease infection tracing;epidemic period;infection detection;mobile communication technology;mobile networking;probabilistic forward technique;smart hospital","","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository.

To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In this paper, we propose a new multi-hop routing approach called ORACE-Net. The proposed protocol uses advertisement packets to establish routes from deployed nodes towards the CC (i.e. Direct Route Establishment). Then, it utilizes the data packets to establish reverse routes (from the CC to all nodes in the network). We implemented and evaluated our approach in realistic scenario using tactical and on-body mobile nodes. Our experiments include also an Internet of Thing (IoT) platform and a real-time dynamic topology website which are used for analyzing the behavior of the protocol. The experimental results show that our protocol increases the mobile nodes connectivity and packet delivery rate. Also, it reduces the average round trip time delay for the on-body nodes compared to the tactical deployed base stations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0724-0; POD:978-1-5090-0725-7","10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763188","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763188","Ad-hoc Wifi;Internet of Things;Optimized Routing Approach for Critical and Emergency Networks;Tactical Multi-Hop Routing Protocol","Ad hoc networks;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Smart phones;Spread spectrum communication","Internet of Things;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Internet of Thing;IoT;ORACE-Net;distant command center;multihop routing;routing protocol;tactical mobile ad-hoc networks;wireless communication networks","","1","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Arrhythmia is the most frequent occurring CVD. Patients having Arrhythmia require continuous monitoring so that the doctor can study the abnormality in their heart beats to gain further insights and suggest treatments. In some cases Arrhythmia can be fatal and might need immediate hospitalization. For this purpose, we have developed a system that remotely acquires ECG sensor readings (taken from MIT-BIH database) of the patient, processes it to predict arrhythmia intelligently and sends the indication alarm immediately to the doctor, when an Arrhythmia episode is detected. Also a report of the patient's heart behavior is generated and fetched to the doctor on his smart phone.

Consequently, these systems either rely critically on close human guidance or operate almost independently from the user. An exemplar technology integrated tightly into our lives is the smartphone. However, the term “smart” is a misnomer, since it has fundamentally no intelligence to understand its user. The users still have to type, touch or speak (to some extent) to express their intentions in a form accessible to the phone. Hence, intelligent decision making is still almost entirely a human task. A life-changing experience can be achieved by transforming machines from passive tools to agents capable of understanding human physiology and what their user wants [1]. This can advance human capabilities in unimagined ways by building a symbiotic relationship to solve real world problems cooperatively. One of the high-impact application areas of this approach is assistive internet of things (IoT) technologies for physically challenged individuals. The Annual World Report on Disability reveals that 15% of the world population lives with disability, while 110 to 190 million of these people have difficulty in functioning [1]. Quality of life for this population can improve significantly if we can provide accessibility to smart devices, which provide sensory inputs and assist with everyday tasks. This work demonstrates that smart IoT devices open up the possibility to alleviate the burden on the user by equipping everyday objects, such as a wheelchair, with decision-making capabilities. Moving part of the intelligent decision making to smart IoT objects requires a robust mechanism for human-machine communication (HMC). To address this challenge, we present examples of multimodal HMC mechanisms, where the modalities are electroenceph- logram (EEG), speech commands, and motion sensing. We also introduce an IoT co-simulation framework developed using a network simulator (OMNeT++) and a robot simulation platform Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP). We show how this framework is used to evaluate the effectiveness of different HMC strategies using automated indoor navigation as a driver application.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4483-8; POD:978-1-5090-3590-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7750992","","","Internet of Things;control engineering computing;decision making;electroencephalography;human-robot interaction;medical computing;medical robotics;smart phones;virtualisation","EEG;HMC;OMNeT++;V-REP;assistive Internet of Things;assistive IoT technologies;electroencephalogram;electronic systems;human physiology;human-machine communication;human-machine interaction;intelligent decision making;motion sensing;network simulator;robot simulation platform;smartphone;speech commands;virtual robot experimentation platform","","","","","","","","2-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method adopted can help the doctor to treat a person with gait abnormalities. Gait analysis deals with the study of walking pattern, in order to understand the gait abnormalities. To treat these gait abnormalities it's necessary to analyse gait parameters such as foot angle, stride distance, step distance, step count, cadence, speed, progression line etc. This project presents a shoe device to measure these parameters with the help of various sensors such as accelerometer, ultrasonic sensor, gyroscope, foot pressure sensor, flex sensor etc. These sensors can be placed in the shoe such that sensors can accurately measure these parameters. The digital output of these sensors can be integrated through a controller and the result of the patient is sent to the doctor's phone or to a GSM device. Hence, this wireless shoe device helps to overcome the disadvantages of the existing system which is practiced in gait motion analysis laboratory. Results of shoe device can be compared with the gait of a normal person in order to differentiate and study the abnormal and normal gait of a person. The development of shoe device is mainly concerned with features like low cost, portable, ease of use and accurate measurements of gait parameters. The objective of shoe integrated sensor system for gait analysis is to provide better digital output results of the abnormal parameters and efficient way of analyzing than clinical gait. This device has various applications in sports for exercise training, medicinally in treating paralyzed patients and in biometric and forensics to identify/improve individual patient by making minor variations.","","CD:978-1-4673-9936-4; DVD:978-1-4673-9937-1; Electronic:978-1-4673-9939-5; POD:978-1-4673-9940-1; USB:978-1-4673-9938-8","10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755103","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755103","GSM;Internet of Things;gait analysis;step length","Acoustics;Flexible printed circuits;Footwear;GSM;Legged locomotion;Medical services;Switches","accelerometers;biomedical measurement;footwear;gait analysis;wireless sensor networks","GSM device;accelerometer;exercise training;flex sensor;foot angle;foot pressure sensor;foot step count;foot step distance;foot stride distance;gait abnormality;gait analysis;gait motion analysis laboratory;gyroscope;integrated sensor system;ultrasonic sensor;walking pattern;wireless shoe device","","","","","","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People with asthma are sensitive to things which may not bother normal people at all. For example they may feel uncomfortable with increased levels of smoke, pollen or fog in air. The number of people suffering from asthma has been rising sharply over the years, pollution being one of the biggest reasons. Though controlling pollution is a broad topic, but preventing oneself from asthma is an easier way out. It is important to keep track of what triggers asthma attack in a patient, because symptoms do not occur right after the exposure to the triggering parameters. The delay in attack occurs depending on how much the person is sensitive to the factor. Thus we try to propose a model of a smart asthma prediction system using Internet of Things.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0996-1; POD:978-1-5090-0997-8","10.1109/IEMCON.2016.7746252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7746252","GPS;Nima;Pollen Detector;Sinusities;VOCs;Watson","Detectors;Diseases;Humidity;Internet of Things;Pollution;Smart phones","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;chemical sensors;diseases;fog;humidity sensors;medical computing;patient care;pneumodynamics;smoke detectors;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;pollution control;smart asthma attack prediction system","","","","","","","","13-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591351","","Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Monitoring;Parallel processing;Program processors;Sensors","Internet of Things;cardiology;diseases;health care;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes","Internet-of-hearts;data analytics;disease pattern recognition;global network;large-scale dynamic network;map reduce;mobile health system;mobile technology;multiple processors;network optimization;parallel computing;sensing technology;smart connected healthcare;stochastic gradient descent approach","","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By using information generated by smart switches, senior citizens are not forced to use wearables, change the battery or feel privacy invasion from cameras. Our solution adopts the statistical-based algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). By adding constrains to reduce the high variances of the mixture model and recursively removing the extremely-low probability data from the model, a more accurate mixture model can be constructed.

However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment.

The coordination of processes of different organizations is a complex task which requires continuous attention. Process mining techniques have been widely used to discover hidden information useful to understand the behaviour of a single process. Thanks to the spread of Internet of Things (IoT), this complex activity can benefit also from the huge amount of data collected for other purposes. In this paper we propose techniques for exploiting the information available in the environment, considering several sources of information to analyse the interconnections of business processes.

In many cases, real measurements are taken so as to map signal strengths, interferences, and so on. However, taking real measurements is very time consuming and becomes impractical in complex, large scenarios. With the aim to avoid this burden, simulation techniques based on Ray Tracing, combining Geometric Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction, are used to predict waves' behaviour within a given environment. Those simulations depend on a number of parameters, namely angular resolution, number of rebounds, cells size, etc. By tuning these parameters, high-definition (HD) and low-definition (LD) results can be obtained. Although more practical than manual measurements, the computational cost of simulations in HD prevents their use in complex environments and their LD counterparts are applied. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) that allows the use of LD simulations (with low computational cost) by lessening their low quality problems. The proposed CF strategy exploits spacial constraints in 2D propagation planes to improve simulation results, which end up being very similar to those of HD, with a fraction of its computational cost.","","","10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580801","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580801","Collaborative Filtering;Ray Launching;Smart Health;Wireless Channel Characterization","Collaboration;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Databases;Filtering;High definition video;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;collaborative filtering;medical computing;wireless channels","2D propagation planes;IoT;angular resolution;antennas deployment planning;cells size;collaborative filtering;complex environments;geometric optics;high-definition results;low-definition results;low-quality problems;medical complex scenarios;ray tracing;rebound number;signal strengths;simulation techniques;two-dimensional collaborative filtering approach;uniform theory-of-diffraction;wave behaviour;wireless channel characterization","","1","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an effective method, with analyzing the structure of a propagation network, a large number of previous studies have analyzed the propagation dynamics. Most of these studies are based on a special network structure to make such analysis. However, a propagation network has dynamically changed structure during the propagation. How to track, recognize and model such dynamic change is a big challenge. Along with the popularity of smart devices and the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive mobile data is automatically collected. In this article, as a typical use case, we investigate the impact of network structure on epidemic propagation dynamics by analyzing the massive mobile data collected from smart devices carried by the volunteers of Ebola outbreak areas. From this investigation, we obtain two observations. Based on these observations and the analytical ability of Apache Spark on streaming data and graphs, we propose a simple model to track and recognize the dynamic structure of a network.

Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.","","","10.1109/NaNA.2016.26","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7564161","6LoWPAN;BLE;CoAP;ISO/IEEE 11073;IoT","IEEE Standards;ISO Standards;Internet of things;Logic gates;Medical services;Protocols;Servers","Bluetooth;IEEE standards;IP networks;ISO standards;Internet of Things;health care;protocols;telemedicine","6LoWPAN;BLE network;Bluetooth Low Energy network;CoAP;IP communication;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services;Internet-of-Things;IoT-based healthcare services;constrained application protocol","","","","","","","","23-25 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithms exploit sparsity of the magnetic resonance (MR) images under the redundant representation of tight frames. We prove that pISTA and pFISTA converge to a minimizer of a convex function with a balanced tight frame sparsity formulation. The pFISTA introduces only one adjustable parameter, the step size, and we provide an explicit rule to set this parameter. Numerical experiment results demonstrate that pFISTA leads to faster convergence speeds than the state-of-art counterpart does, while achieving comparable reconstruction errors.

CTCS patients showed aberrant functional hubs predominately at some particular frequency bands and primary in the default mode network (DMN) and the somatomotor network (SMN).

A new sparse reconstruction model with the multiclass dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain imaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling patterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art magnetic resonance image reconstruction methods. Conclusion: Artifacts are better suppressed and image edges are better preserved than the compared methods.

A key success factor in implementing information security is both awareness and training of healthcare workers, and commitment of healthcare institutions to ensure it.","","CD-ROM:978-953-233-088-5; Electronic:978-953-233-086-1; POD:978-1-5090-2543-5","10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522357","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7522357","","Electronic mail;Internet of things;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Mobile applications;Mobile handsets;Security","electronic data interchange;health care;medical information systems;mobile computing;security of data","data exchange;healthcare institutions;information security;mobile device;security aspects","","","","","","","","May 30 2016-June 3 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen.

Emerging IoT-technologies open new horizons also for medical care solutions. Stable cloud architecture technologies deliver the comprehensive back-end infrastructural basis for dealing efficiently with the foreseeable human medical data boom.

Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0898-8; POD:978-1-5090-0899-5","10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501720","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501720","","Algorithm design and analysis;Autism;Dementia;Sensors;Smart phones","application program interfaces;health care;medical computing;medical disorders;mobile computing;pattern recognition","Alzheimers disorder;Alzimio app;Android API;activity recognition algorithms;autism;dementia;max-in-window algorithm;mobile app;safe-zone geofencing;smartphones;threshold-based algorithms","","","","16","","","","18-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We expect that LPWAN can be part of enabling new human-centric health and wellness monitoring applications. Therefore in this work we study the indoor performance of one LPWAN technology, namely LoRa, by the means of real-life measurements. The measurements were conducted using the commercially available equipment in the main campus of the University of Oulu, Finland, which has an indoor area spanning for over 570 meters North to South and over 320 meters East to West. The measurements were executed for a sensor node operating close to human body that was periodically reporting the sensed data to a base station. The obtained results show that when using 14 dBm transmit power and the largest spreading factor of 12 for the 868 MHz ISM band, the whole campus area can be covered. Measured packet success delivery ratio was 96.7 % without acknowledgements and retransmissions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2849-8; POD:978-1-5090-2850-4","10.1109/ISMICT.2016.7498898","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498898","IoT;LPWAN;RSSI;chirp spread spectrum;coverage;health;path loss;range;welness","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Base stations;Chirp;Internet of things;Monitoring;Sea measurements","health care;patient monitoring;power consumption;radio transceivers;wide area networks","Finland;LoRa LPWAN technology;University of Oulu;frequency 868 MHz;human-centric health and wellness monitoring;power consumption;remote health monitoring;transceiver;transmit power;wellbeing monitoring","","8","","11","","","","20-23 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Wearable IoT Device is a wireless sensor node integrated in a Chest Belt, and it has the capacity to monitor the following parameters: body temperature, heart and breathing rates and body position. After a minimal data processing, this set of information is sent to the Gateway, via ZigBee technology, and it is accessible to the user through the H Medical Interface. If a critical event occurs, the device will trigger an alarm, visible and audible in the proximity, and sends a distress message to a mobile application.

Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of ""things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we ""acquire"" and ""distribute"" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds.

They promise to offer information about sleep quality of the user by recording a limited number of vital signals, mainly heart rate and body movement. Typically, fitness trackers, smart watches, smart shirts, smartphone applications or patches do not provide access to the raw sensor data. Moreover, the sleep classification algorithm and the agreement ratio with the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG) are not disclosed. Some commercial systems record and store the data on the wearable device, but the user needs to transfer and import it into specialised software applications or return it to the doctor, for clinical evaluation of the data set. Thus an immediate feedback mechanism or the possibility of remote control and supervision are lacking. Furthermore, many such systems only distinguish between sleep and wake states, or between wake, light sleep and deep sleep. It is not always clear how these stages are mapped to the four known sleep stages: REM, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3-4. [1] The goal of this research is to find a reduced complexity method to process a minimum number of bio vital signals, while providing accurate sleep classification results. The model we propose offers remote control and real time supervision capabilities, by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

The mobile nutrition area is widely popular with thousands of people around the world accessing information related to nutrition and wellbeing. However, mobile nutrition apps still can offer more to their users by providing better overall Human Device Interaction (HDI). As nutrition apps are used daily, it is imperative to ensure that users can easily grasp their concept, thus allowing them to quickly understand and receive the information they require to achieve a better lifestyle. The problem lies with HDI elements associated with these apps. This research paper highlights the problems with HDI in mobile nutrition apps through an investigative survey. The questionnaire based quantitative survey was used to understand the patterns associated with mobile HDI in the nutrition landscape and how the user interacts with the mobile app throughout the nutrition tracking process. Respondents clearly showed that the following main problems: difficult to input information into the mobile app, too time consuming to complete, not motivated in any way and also a poor overall user interface. The survey results have enabled us to conclude a number of points that greatly impact the overall HDI of nutrition apps. This was of great importance as it laid the foundations to investigate and explore further opportunities in this area.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-8251-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-8253-3; POD:978-1-4673-8254-0","10.1109/RAECS.2015.7453410","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453410","biomedical monitoring;human computer interaction;internet of things;mobile computing;patient monitoring","Bridges;Context;Image recognition;Mobile communication;Real-time systems;Three-dimensional displays;Tracking","human computer interaction;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;smart phones","human computer interaction;human-device interaction patterns;mobile HDI elements;mobile nutrition application;mobile nutrition area;mobile nutrition context;nutrition tracking process","","","","40","","","","21-22 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As IoT is aimed to connect everything to Internet, there are billions of sensors which are attached to things to access data and connect these things to internet. So the data provided by these sensors is growing very fast. We need to handle this big data on personals gadgets as well on central databases. To deal with this problem, in this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems.

Combining the IPA concept with the recent paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT), offers new possibilities and new services to end users, since they could learn more about other entities present in the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a novel mobile gateway solution for a ubiquitous mobile health scenario, in which information gathered from a body sensor network (BSN) is used by an IPA belonging to another person, typically mentioned to as caretaker. The mobile gateway receives real time information related to location, heart rate, and possible falls of the monitored person and acts as a communication channel between the BSN sensors and the IPA platform.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving trust model based on the observation that a large class of applications can be provisioned based on simple threshold detection. The key issue we address in this work is how to minimize privacy loss in the presence of untrusted service providers so that providers are prevented from disclosing information to third parties for secondary uses. Our work can be considered as a lightweight approach to functional encryption (FE) for privacy-preservation. The main algorithm in the proposed model is a uniformization scheme that uses a combination of sensor aliases to hide the identity of the sensing source and per-function initialization vector to reveal information only to relevant service providers.

For this study, the infrared image of knee joint is mainly concern. When the doctors examine illness by infrared image, in addition to the observation the image directly, they often need to use the means of computer image processing to analyze the image. In addition, it is very difficult to avoid the interference of external factors in the process of collecting infrared image, which can form variety thermal noise. So the infrared image noise reduction processing is very necessary. But the image is still in a relatively narrow range after the noise reduction, so using image enhancement algorithm to deal with the infrared image is necessary. Through the comparison analysis, it is found that the weighted histogram equalization algorithm in the enhancement of image contrast, which can not only retains the shape and trend of the original gray histogram, but also retains image details to a large extent.

Finding a reliable path is an effective means of solving the network reliability. This paper analyzed the medical sensor network characteristics and requirements. Aiming to the special needs of the medical wireless network, a reliable multi-path routing protocol (RRMP) was proposed. The RRMP was based on links stability prediction by lists of neighbor's nodes. And the reliable multi-path is realized by means of calculating path reliability factor and path delay factor.

Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. But it's still not implemented for the broad scope of Hospitals, and especially in Pakistan it's not being used for any purpose in health sector. So we need to define and provide IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS). In this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems. We have used Context awareness as middleware above network layer to overcome the problem of data management. Moreover we did survey to investigate the decision to adopt the IoT based system in Pakistani Hospitals. Survey was questionnaire based.

In IoT everything collaborates to deliver services and applications to users, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) being one of these applications. Some AAL smart homes uses infrared sensors to recognize some activities of daily living and to track people along the environment. Location tracking is vital in Ambient Assisted living and can be a useful information to improve AAL systems. A common problem in such systems is that each tracking model is based on a specific sensor's placing architecture. In order to assure that the system will work properly, the model has to be fitted by an expert. Modeling is usually costly and it relies on a specific architecture. In our previous work, the tracking model needed to be fitted manually. In order to introduce adaptability, this work proposes an approach to automatically fit the model avoiding the need of an expert to fit a different model for each kind of sensor's placing architecture. The proposed approach was evaluated using real data from a set of pyroelectric infrared sensors and a set of scenarios performed in a simulated apartment.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9526-7; POD:978-1-4673-9527-4","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414030","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414030","","Adaptation models;Infrared sensors;Internet of things;Smart homes","Internet of Things;assisted living;infrared detectors;patient care;pyroelectric detectors;telemedicine","AAL smart homes;Internet of Things;adaptive tracking model;ambient assisted living;automatic fitting;daily living activities;human intervention;location tracking;medical nursing home;pyroelectric infrared sensors;specific sensor's placing architecture","","3","","16","","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a tiered data integration scheme for mHealth systems that works on the schema, entity, and event levels. The proposed scheme incorporates an algorithm that merges and ranks sensor streams for schema integration and event identification, and performs contextual record registration and deduplication for entity resolution.

The connection of IoT to applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is common in order to propose practical solutions. Simultaneously, games are known to increase interest and motivation among students when they are designed with pedagogic intent. Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them.

To this aim, in this paper, we propose to exploit field effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs) to devise a molecular antenna capable of transducing molecular messages into electrical signals. In particular, focusing on the use of SiNW FET-based biosensors as molecular antennas, we develop deterministic and noise models for the antenna operation to provide a theoretical framework for the optimization of the device from communication perspective. We numerically evaluate the performance of the antenna in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the electrical output.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0366-2; POD:978-1-5090-0367-9; USB:978-1-5090-0365-5","10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389134","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389134","Bio-cyber interface;Internet of Bio-NanoThings;Molecular antenna;Molecular communications;SiNW bioFET","Antennas;Biological system modeling;Internet;Logic gates;Steady-state;Stochastic processes;Transducers","Internet of Things;antennas;biocybernetics;bioelectric phenomena;biological techniques;biomedical communication;biomedical electronics;biosensors;elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;medical signal processing;nanowires;optimisation;silicon","FET-based biosensors;Internet of BionanoThings;SNR;Si;antenna operation;bioFET;biochemical domain;biocyber interfaces;electrical domain;electrical signals;electromagnetic networks;field effect transistor based biosensors;macroscale cyber networks;medical domain;molecular antenna;molecular messages;molecular nanonetworks;noise models;signal-to-noise ratio","","5","","22","","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health. This paper proposes an IoT-based architecture for the sport of football, called IoT Football. Our proposal aims to embed sensing devices (e.g. sensors and RFID), telecommunication technologies (e.g. ZigBee) and cloud computing in the sport of football in order monitor the health of footballers and reduce the occurrence of adverse health conditions.

These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City.

As the data keeps growing in complexity, users find it difficult to navigate and understand the relationships between the sets. There are limitations such as scalability and sub-optimal layouts being produced with the state-of-the-art visualization methods such as Euler diagrams, Treemap diagrams and ConSets. So, an effective visual method is in great need to produce an optimal layout and identify set properties with ease. This motivated us to develop a novel visual method called “Spherule diagrams” to improve the analysis of set relationships effectively. Then a small-scale user preference study was conducted to compare Euler diagrams with Spherule diagrams, where 80% participants preferred Spherule diagrams for its simplicity, navigation, better layout and set ordering characteristics. The other results based on error rate and rating, Spherule diagrams outperformed Euler diagrams. Thus, we provide evidence that Spherule diagrams are preferred over Euler diagrams for visualizing set relations.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7910-6; POD:978-1-4673-7911-3; USB:978-1-4673-7909-0","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380712","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380712","Euler diagrams;Set theory;human-computer interaction;information visualization;visualization techniques","Data visualization;Error analysis;Green computing;Layout;Navigation;Visualization;Yttrium","Internet;computational complexity;data visualisation;matrix algebra;trees (mathematics)","ConSets;Euler diagrams;error rate;internet;matrix-based set visualization;set ordering characteristics;spherule diagrams;state-of-the-art visualization methods;suboptimal layouts;treemap diagrams;visual method;visualization techniques","","4","","19","","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The incapability to search on the basis of the relation between the keywords and the user concepts, generates noise and hence, results in irrelevant retrieval. This leads to the idea of performing Semantic information processing by mapping the user's Concept and Context of the query with the retrieved results to filter (remove) noise from the query. The present study suggests Noise Removal for Semantic Information Processing (NRSIP) framework for the Search Problem (SP): find expert(s) in Panjab University. The framework allows the user to perform categorical search. Instead of inputting all the keywords, it allows the user to select the best matched option from the available choices to formulate the Semantic Query (SQ). The relevant information for the SQ is then retrieved by the Present Search Engine (PSE) used.

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7910-6; POD:978-1-4673-7911-3; USB:978-1-4673-7909-0","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380509","Android App;Android Smartphones;Mean Shift Algorithm;Patients with diabetes;RGB color evaluation","Algorithm design and analysis;Diabetes;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Smart phones;Wounds","cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones","Android App;Android smartphone;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;caregivers;chronic ulcer image analysis;diabetic patient;diabetic ulcers;flexible wound assessment system;healing status;high-resolution digital camera;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;skin color;visual examination;wound assessment;wound image analysis system;wound size","","1","","9","","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blood centers collect, process and transport blood to hospitals and other health care centers. Sometimes blood is collected directly from blood donors rather than taking it from blood bank. Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases. The proposed system is a web based application which helps to reduce the human mistakes or errors and different techniques can be applied for blood type classification, diagnosing diabetic symptoms, classifying blood type and identifying different donors reaction and apply preventive measures against them.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7910-6; POD:978-1-4673-7911-3; USB:978-1-4673-7909-0","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380516","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380516","Blood Bank;Classification algorithm;Data Mining;Database;DonorHart tool","Blood;Classification algorithms;Cloud computing;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern matching;Safety","Internet;data mining;health care;medical information systems;pattern recognition;safety","DonorHART system;Web based application;automatic pattern recognition;blood donor safety;data mining;donor reactions information;risk monitoring","","","","27","","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The topographical map of the brain is divided into different regions and synchrony measures are computed between these different regions to identify the region responsible for epileptic seizure. The molecular and biochemical process of seizure generation during pre-ictal period is essential for seizure to start and this property has been investigated here in EEG signals to predict the onset of epileptic seizure. Particular region of the brain responsible for seizure is identified by pairing the EEG signals from different regions of brain and identifying the changes in synchrony measures corresponding to those regions. Two synchrony measures one from time domain, correlation, and other from frequency domain, coherence, are used in this work to validate the observations. Coherence and correlation increases in pre-ictal state and hence seizure onset can be predicted in advance.

Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality constitutes the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme for an e-health application. This scheme allows both of sensors and the Base Station (BS) to authenticate each other in order to secure the collection of health-related data. Our scheme uses nonces and Keyed-Hash message authentication (HMAC) to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides authentication with less energy consumption, and it terminates with a session key agreement between each sensor and the Base Station. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that our scheme saves energy.

A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32. The proposed system is intended to be powered by an energy scavenging circuit without compromising its own performance.

There is also the emergence of smart environments such as smart homes, cars, highways, cities, factories and grids. Presently, it is difficult to quickly forecast or prevent urgent health situations in real-time as health data are analyzed offline by a physician. Sensors are expected to be overloaded by demands of providing health data from IoT networks and smart environments. This paper proposes to resolve the problems by introducing an inference system so that life-threatening situations can be prevented in advance based on a short and long term health status prediction. This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud. The inference system can also resolve the problem of data overload in sensor nodes by reducing data volume and frequency to reduce workload in sensor nodes. This paper presents a novel idea of tracking down and predicting a personal health status as well as intelligent functionality of inference in sensor nodes to interface IoT networks.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9348-5; POD:978-1-4673-9349-2","10.1109/ATNAC.2015.7366781","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366781","Cloud;Health status;Inference;IoT;Life expectancy;big data;data mining;mHealth;mIoT","Big data;Intelligent sensors;Medical services;Sensor systems;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;cloud computing;data mining;health care;inference mechanisms;mobile radio","IoT networks;converged Internet of Things;data overload problem;inference system;long-term health status prediction;mHealth;mobile health perspective;personal health information;predictive data mining;sensor nodes;short-term health status prediction;smart cars;smart cities;smart factories;smart grids;smart highways;smart homes;smart wearable devices","","","","24","","","","18-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation. Also, the demand on high security increases difficulties of designing reliable platform for integrating and managing multi-resource life-logging health data. This paper investigates the possibility of collecting and aggregating life-logging data with the use of wearable devices, mobile apps and social media. It compares existing personal health data collection solutions and identifies essential needs of designing a life-logging data aggregator in the IoT environments. An integrated data collection solution with high secure standard is proposed and deployed on a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare platform: MHA [15] by integrating five life-logging resources: Fitbit, Moves, Facbook, Twitter, etc. The preliminary experiment demonstrates that it successfully record, store and reuse the unified and structured personal health information in a long term, including activities, location, exercise, sleep, food, heat rate and mood.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.342","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363388","interdisciplinary;internet of things;life-logging data;wearable computing","Biomedical monitoring;Data collection;Facebook;Media;Medical services;Mobile communication;Twitter","Internet of Things;data aggregation;data integration;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;social networking (online)","Facbook;Fitbit;Internet of Things;IoT environments;Moves;Twitter;heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation;interdisciplinary healthcare collaboration;interdisciplinary healthcare research;life-logging personal health data;long-term health data collection;mobile apps;multiresource life-logging health data integration;multiresource life-logging health data management;personal health data collection solutions;social media;wearable devices","","6","","29","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS).

The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism.

Currently, the gold standard in terms of sleep analysis is overnight polysomnography (PSG), during which several techniques like EEG (eletroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram), EMG (electromyogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) and for example respiratory airflow and respiratory effort are recorded. These expensive and complex procedures, applied in sleep laboratories, are invasive and unfamiliar for the subjects and it is a reason why it might have an impact on the recorded data. These are the main reasons why low-cost home diagnostic systems are likely to be advantageous. Their aim is to reach a larger population by reducing the number of parameters recorded. Nowadays, many wearable devices promise to measure sleep quality using only the ECG and body-movement signals. This work presents an android application developed in order to proof the accuracy of an algorithm published in the sleep literature. The algorithm uses ECG and body movement recordings to estimate sleep stages. The pre-recorded signals fed into the algorithm have been taken from physionet1 online database. The obtained results have been compared with those of the standard method used in PSG. The mean agreement ratios between the sleep stages REM, Wake, NREM-1, NREM-2 and NREM-3 were 38.1%, 14%, 16%, 75% and 54.3%.","","Electronic:978-8-8875-4808-2; POD:978-1-4673-9793-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7356980","Heartbeat;REM stage;algorithm;body-movement;non REM stage;sleep stage","Classification algorithms;Electrocardiography;Electromyography;Heart beat;Signal processing algorithms;Sleep","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;signal classification;sleep","ECG;EEG;EMG;EOG;NREM-1 sleep stage;NREM-2 sleep stage;NREM-3 sleep stage;REM sleep stage;SpO2;android application;blood oxygen saturation;body movement recordings;body-movement signals;electrocardiogram;electromyogram;electrooculogram;eletroencephalogram;low-cost home diagnostic systems;polysomnography;sleep analysis;sleep stage classification;wake sleep stage;wearable devices","","","","20","","","","29-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we propose an IoT framework where medication intake is ensured with real time continuous activity recognition. We present our use case with the focus of application and network layers. We utilize an activity classification scheme, which considers inter-activity detection consistency based on non-predefined feature extraction as the application layer.

Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8321-9; POD:978-1-4673-8077-5","10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7331376","Approximate Computing;Biomedical Healthcare;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT;Wearable Devices","Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Encoding;Histograms;Medical services;Monitoring","biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring","Huffman table;battery-operated wearable devices;biosignal compressor;compression technique;energy supply;hardware resources;ultralow-power design;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable device energy consumption;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;wireless communication","","2","","32","","","","4-9 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service.

Given the importance of developing safe and secure software for these applications, it is interesting to observe that the vast majority of software for these devices is written in the C programming language -an inherently unsafe language as compared to other modern languages. This paper examines the characteristics and requirements that uniquely differentiate embedded systems from other application domains. The result is a blueprint for a modern, high-level programming language specifically designed for embedded systems.","","Paper:978-1-84919-970-4","10.1049/cp.2014.1541","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284225","","","C language;embedded systems;software fault tolerance","C programming language;application domains;blueprint;computational power;embedded system programming language;high-level programming language;software development;software flaws","","","","","","","","4-6 Dec. 2014","","IET","IET Conferences"

In order to solve the newly appearing problem of automatic brain cognitive control detection, we design a system in this paper. An auditory cognitive control EEG experiment was used to acquire EEG data of the user. We proposed a complete cognitive control process which contains three stages: (sensory stage: 110~140ms, identification stage: 260~320ms, execution stage: 500~700ms). Based on this cognitive process, each EEG sample is divided into three parts. Average amplitude in time domain and LZC (LempelZiv Complexity) was computed for the divided part of each EEG sample and used to extract features from the EEG signal. Optimized SVM was used to recognize the EEG sample. The results show that the union of average amplitude time domain and nonlinear dynamics parameter-LZC with the better recognition accuracy of 99.33%. The experiment result shows that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of automatic brain cognitive control detection.

With the rapid increase in the number of Internetconnected devices, the increased demand of real-time, low-latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional cloud computing framework. Also, our irreplaceable dependency on cloud computing demands the cloud data centers (DCs) always to be up and running which exhausts huge amount of power and yield tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. In this work, we assess the applicability of the newly proposed fog computing paradigm to serve the demands of the latency-sensitive applications in the context of IoT. We model the fog computing paradigm by mathematically characterizing the fog computing network in terms of power consumption, service latency, CO2 emission, and cost, and evaluating its performance for an environment with high number of Internet-connected devices demanding realtime service. A case study is performed with traffic generated from the 100 highest populated cities being served by eight geographically distributed DCs. Results show that as the number of applications demanding real-time service increases, the fog computing paradigm outperforms traditional cloud computing. For an environment with 50% applications requesting for instantaneous, real-time services, the overall service latency for fog computing is noted to decrease by 50:09%. However, it is mentionworthy that for an environment with less percentage of applications demanding for low-latency services, fog computing is observed to be an overhead compared to the traditional cloud computing. Therefore, the work shows that in the context of IoT, with high number of latency-sensitive applications fog computing outperforms cloud computing.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2485206","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286781","Carbon-dioxide emission;Cloud computing;Fog computing;Internet of things (IoT);Power consumption;Service latency","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Context;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Real-time systems","","","","31","","","","","20151001","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Thus, personal career planner (PCP) via brain-computer interface (BCI) proposed in this paper to complete the career assessment through the analysis of instant brainwave response corresponds to the prompted questions. Those excitement levels are retrieved by using Emotiv neuroheadgear and are distributed evenly to the respective questionnaires. The questionnaire is designed based on Dr. Holland career theory - The Holland Codes. The system will then classified accordingly and upshot the recommended career opportunities. This paper includes experiments to prove that brainwaves can response instantaneously to external stimuli, which are the major concerns in the proposed system.

Such performance can be obtained with time-based digital pixel sensors (DPS) working at ultra-low voltage (ULV), at the expense of lower dynamic range, higher fixed-pattern noise (FPN) and thus poorer image quality. To address this problem, three key techniques were developed in this work for DPS pixels: wide-range adaptive body biasing, low-gating of the 2-transistor in-pixel comparator and digital readout performing delta-reset sampling with low switching activity and robust timing closure. These concepts were demonstrated by designing and fabricating a 128 × 128 CMOS image sensor array in a 65 nm low-power CMOS logic process. Operating at 0.5 V, it features an FPN of 0.66%, a dynamic range of 42 dB and a fill factor of 57% with a 4 μm pixel pitch, while consuming only 17 pJ/(frame.pixel) and 8.8 μW at 32 fps.

In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals.

The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities.

IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people.

While more wireless sensing devices are becoming available, network connectivity and scalability remain the key obstacles in achieving seamless information flow and service provision as envisaged by the vision of the Internet of Things. In this paper, a mobile 6LoWPAN network architecture is proposed by engaging Android-based mobile devices as edge routers to address the connectivity and scalability issues with the wider IP network for pervasive healthcare applications. The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor network, together with the Android edge router, form a mobile sub-network that allows seamless information exchange with the Internet and improves service availability for each end user. The proposed architecture includes a customised bare-metal 6LoWPAN protocol designed for ultra low power wireless sensor nodes for long term vital signs monitoring and integrated with Android devices for mobile internet access.

In business, industries, institutions and organizations, individuals contribute the data volume like technical reports, seminar reports, research papers, dissertations, thesis etc. For instance, 30 billion web pages are accessed or the World Wide Web. With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms.

Also, it can be folded, cut, perforated, crumpled, etc. This article focuses on monitoring porous Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) layer on paper-based substrate for the detection of humidity. Porous AAO is a material with cylindrical pore geometry and high aspect ratio. Further, this material has many advantages, such as, easy fabrication, pore diameter's uniformity with high pore density (10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) and its use like humidity sensors. In summary, the AAO process fabrication on paper substrate is challenging causes of his ease of implementation, cost-effective and the use of a highly economical, conformable and ecological substrate. In this study, an experimental setup had been developed to anodize an aluminum layer deposit on flexible substrate by using phosphoric acid. Various anodization parameters (voltage, current density, temperature and concentration) have been investigated to obtain an AAO layer with good electrical properties and high reliability on flexible substrate. An interdigital capacitance has been deposited on the best AAO layer produced to fabricate a moisture sensor. The different sensors produced had been characterized versus humidity concentration and frequency in a climatic chamber. Depending on the AAO morphology parameters, the average sensitivity can be tuned from 0.8 pF/RH% to 9 pF/RH%.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8625-5; POD:978-1-4799-8545-6; USB:978-1-4799-8626-2","10.1109/DTIP.2015.7161018","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7161018","aluminium oxide;humidity sensor;nanoporous AAO layer;paper-based substrate;thin film","Artificial intelligence;Biomedical monitoring;Moisture measurement;Monitoring;Polymers;Pressure measurement;Voltage measurement","aluminium compounds;anodisation;capacitance;flexible electronics;humidity sensors;paper;phosphors;porosity;thin film sensors","AAO morphology parameters;AAO process fabrication;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;Internet Of Things;aluminum layer deposit;anodization parameters;climatic chamber;cylindrical pore geometry;electronics component;flexible electronics;flexible substrate;food safety;high aspect ratio;interdigital capacitance;medical diagnostic applications;microtechnology;moisture sensor feasibility;paper-based substrate;phosphoric acid;porous AAO layer","","0","","24","","","","27-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers.

However, MQTT-SN faces a new set of challenges for service guarantees when operated for a reliable or time-critical applications. The impact of various network parameters on the MQTT-SN service assurance requires an end-to-end system study, which are unexplored yet. In this paper we analyze in detail about the end-to-end service assurance parameters such as content delivery delay and probability of content delivery for a MQTT-SN to be used in health care Internet of Things (IoT). To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals. Both these service assurance parameters will give more insight into the number of content/request arrivals that can be supported for a given service assurance requirement. In addition these service assurance parameters will be of help to design the system more effectively.

In this paper, the Erlongshan Reservoir region of Heilongjiang province is selected as research area, and a secondary segmentation framework is proposed for small objects recognition based on salience detection and Hough Transform. Firstly, the salience of particular small objects is calculated to find candidates of small objects. Next, the Hough Transform is performed on an enhanced RSI constrained by the size of small size to identify small objects from others, such as highway fragment, river fragment, house and farmland and so on. The experiments results regarding small reservoir segmentation show that the method has high robustness and generalization ability, and the idea of classification can be used to the automatic interpreting process of other kind of small objects of RSI.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7533-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-7534-1; POD:978-1-4799-7535-8","10.1109/ICAIOT.2015.7111562","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111562","Hough Transform;remote sensing image;saliency detection;small object recognition","Encoding;Image resolution;Image segmentation;Sensors","Hough transforms;feature extraction;image segmentation;object recognition;remote sensing","Hough transform;RSI;object recognition;remote sensing image;salience detection;targets segmentation","","0","","11","","","","17-18 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More other diseases such as chickenpox, malaria, etc. are also serious threat to people's physical and mental health. Therefore proper techniques for disease surveillance are highly demanded. Recently, social media analysis is regarded as an efficient way to achieve this goal, which is feasible since growing number of people post their health information to social media such as blogs, personal website, etc. Previous work on social media analysis mainly focused on English materials but hardly considered Chinese materials, which hinders the use of such technique for Chinese people. In this paper, we proposed a new method of Chinese social media analysis for disease surveillance. More specifically, we compared different kinds of methods in the process of classification, and then proposed a new way to process Chinese text data. The Chinese Sina micro-blog data collected from September to December 2013 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that a high classification precision of 87.49% in average is obtained.

In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5967-9; POD:978-1-4799-5968-6","10.1109/iThings.2014.16","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059641","artifical neural network;hypertension prediction;logistic regression","Analytical models;Artificial neural networks;Diseases;Hypertension;Logistics;Predictive models;Regression analysis","backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis","ANN;AUC;BP algorithm;BRFSS;Internet of Things;IoT technology;MLP neural network model;area under the receiver-operator curve;artificial neural network-based approach;back propagation;behavior risk factor surveillance system;binary logistic regression model;cardiovascular diseases;chronic disease prediction model;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;healthcare technology;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;multilayer perception neural network model;population aging;quality of life improvement","","2","","30","","","","1-3 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the growing interest of the research community in IoT, and the emergence of several surveys and papers addressing its architecture and its elements, we are still lacking a thorough analysis of the security and privacy properties that are required for a system where the constituent devices vary in their capabilities. In this paper we provide a threat model based on use-cases of IoT, which can be used to determine where efforts should be invested in order to secure these systems. We conclude by recommending measures that will help in providing security and assuring privacy when using IoT.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7907-3; POD:978-1-4799-7908-0","10.1109/SIoT.2014.10","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058906","Internet of Things;Security;Threats","Actuators;Context;Internet of things;Medical services;Privacy;Security;Sensors","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","Internet of Things;IoT;privacy analysis;smart cities;smart homes;threat model;threat-based security analysis;user trust","","15","","43","","","","10-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the advent of modern technologies the need-gap may be augmented. Sensor is one such technology which can be used to enable Internet of Things based health-care monitoring system. In this paper, implementation of such a system is described. In a real time health monitoring system, there are many sensors connected to a local data processing unit through a shared channel having a fixed bandwidth. These sensors have a wide variety of channel access requirements. The access to the channel should be discrete, so that each and every sensor avails the required bandwidth and delay in the shared channel. In this paper, a scheduling technique is proposed for the IoT based system, which nullify interference among different sensors and consequent distortation of precious health data. Implementation of this technique in our prototype health-care monitoring application is discussed in this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4272-5; POD:978-1-4799-4271-8","10.1109/EAIT.2014.50","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052038","Healthcare;IoT;Scheduling;WSN","Bandwidth;Electrocardiography;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical telemetry;health care;patient monitoring;scheduling;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT based system;channel access requirements;consequent distortation;delay;fixed bandwidth;health data;health-care monitoring application;health-care monitoring system;health-care services;local data processing unit;real time health monitoring system;scheduling technique;sensor interference aware scheduling;shared channel","","3","","11","","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Log compression is being used to compress the data to 8 bits. Since log compression is a non linear compression it is very difficult to trace the original characteristics of the signal. In this paper various global and local compression techniques were studied as a replacement for log compression so that the dynamic range of image can be retrieved if the physician has a better monitor for display, and also ensure minimum error in the retrieved signal leading to minimum error in retrieved image. From the results it is observed that Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of wavelet compressed image is 1.02 times more and that of gamma compressed image is 2.24 times more than log compressed image. Gamma based compression can be preferred to log and wavelet based compression, as it gives good quality image when compared with other compression techniques, but cannot be used to retrieve the statistical properties when expanded, since these statistical properties are helpful for doctors for better analysis. Wavelet based compression serves this purpose and hence is best suited for Internet of Things (IoT) enabled ultrasound system for remote diagnosis in the cloud.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4084-4; POD:978-1-4799-4083-7","10.1109/IECBES.2014.7047584","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047584","Gamma compression;Log compression;Nakagami distribution;Structural SIMilarity (SSIM);Visual Information Fidelity (VIF);Wavelet based compression","Dynamic range;Image coding;Imaging;Indexes;Nakagami distribution;Radio frequency;Ultrasonic imaging","Internet;Internet of Things;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;cathode-ray tubes;laptop computers;liquid crystal displays;medical image processing;notebook computers;wavelet transforms","CRT;Internet of Things;IoT enabled ultrasound imaging system;IoT enabled ultrasound system;Structural SIMilarity;cathode ray tube;cloud-based patient diagnosis;display monitor;doctor analysis;dynamic image range;dynamic transducer range;gamma compressed image;gamma-based compression;global data compression techniques;good quality image;handheld ultrasound imaging system;image statistical properties;liquid crystal display;local data compression techniques;log compressed image;log compression replacement;log-based compression;nonlinear data compression;original signal characteristics;physician analysis;remote patient diagnosis;retrieved image minimum error;retrieved signal minimum error;transducer echo signals;ultrasound imaging transducer;ultrasound machine LCD monitor;wavelet based compression;wavelet compressed image SSIM","","1","","17","","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed-and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2378783","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979219","Body Area Networks;Encryption;One-Time Pad;Privacy;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Biomedical monitoring;Body area networks;Computer security;Encryption;Intelligent sensors;Medical devices;Medical services;Privacy;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless sensors networks","","","","4","","31","","","20141208","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a WBAN, network longevity is a major challenge due to the limitation of the availability of energy supply in body nodes. Therefore, routing protocols can play a key role towards making such networks energy efficient. In this work, we exhibit that a routing protocol together with an effective body node coordinator (BNC) deployment strategy can influence the network lifetime eminently. Our initial work shows that the variation in the placement of a BNC within a WBAN could significantly vary the overall network lifetime. This motivated us to work on an effective node placement strategy for a BNC, within a WBAN; and thus we propose three different BNC placement algorithms considering different features of available energy efficient routing protocols in a WBAN.

In addition, self-synchronous switching is achieved by applying electrodes to the track of the rolling ball. A new passive prebiasing mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the pulse generator. Both simulation and experimental results were conducted to demonstrate the improvement. Experimental results show that 76% more energy can be extracted by the prebias mechanism compared to the unbiased case. A transmission circuit based on a Colpitts oscillator was built to test the performance of the capacitor-powered oscillator, which is designed as the load of the pulse generator.

With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.","","Electronic:978-1-63190-043-3; POD:978-1-4799-5328-8","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257621","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014600","30 day readmission;Cloud;Collaboration;Internet of things;M2M;Management;Policy;Predictive Analytics;Sensors;e-health","Context;Electronic mail;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Sensors;Wide area networks","Internet of Things;cloud computing;hospitals;medical computing;patient care;risk analysis","30 day readmission protection program;Internet of things;US healthcare affordable care act;care quality;compromised data;data availability;data unavailability;e-health architecture;healthcare outcomes;hospitals;loT enabled cloud based e-health;post discharge;post discharge care;proactive care;readmission avoidance efforts;reduced payment penalties;risk patterns","","0","","12","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, this paper proposes an architecture that considers the use of different types of health managers and gateways, but keeping interoperability by the use of widely adopted standards. The main contribution of this work is the distribution of health managers in different locations, such as mobile devices and cloud applications, enabling the use of a single health service for different types of PHDs. The ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is used as core technology, enabling the transport of PHD information over different technologies and protocols.

Their massive adoption and use is expected to increase further, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately: their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the CloudIoT paradigm. To bridge this gap, in this paper we review the literature about the integration of Cloud and IoT. We start analyzing and discussing the need for integrating them, the challenges deriving from such integration, and how these issues have been tackled in literature. We then describe application scenarios that have been presented in literature, as well as platforms -- both commercial and open source -- and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm.

We identify a number of design principles and features that need to be satisfied by such a framework. The most important of these principles is the separation of networking protocol aspects into abstraction representations, which are exposed in a unified format to upper layers of PalCom, and communication mechanisms which are hidden by media-specific implementations of our proposed media-abstraction framework for PalCom.

"An On-Demand WebRTC and IoT Device Tunneling Service for Hospitals","T. Sandholm; B. Magnusson; B. A. Johnsson","HP Labs., Palo Alto, CA, USA","2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","20141215","2014","","","53","60","In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4357-9; POD:978-1-4799-4356-2","10.1109/FiCloud.2014.19","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984175","iot;medical applications;palcom;rtc;webrtc","Browsers;Hospitals;Logic gates;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Standards;WebRTC","Internet;Internet of Things;biomedical equipment;firewalls;health care;hospitals;internetworking;wireless LAN","NAT;VPN solutions;WebRTC gateway service;WebRTC traffic;ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic;concurrent streams;direct browser-to-browser connection;external machines;home-care deployments;hospital firewall;local WiFi network;local gateway services;local home network;local hospital network;medical devices;on-demand IoT device tunneling service;on-demand WebRTC service;tunnel sensor","","4","","22","","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, user acceptance of such systems is a critical factor that hinders the adoption of this promising approach due to severe privacy concerns. We present UPECSI, an approach for user-driven privacy enforcement for cloud-based services in the Internet of Things to address this critical factor. UPECSI enables enforcement of all privacy requirements of the user once her sensitive data leaves the border of her network, provides a novel approach for the integration of privacy functionality into the development process of cloud-based services, and offers the user an adaptable and transparent configuration of her privacy requirements.

Knowledge discovery will be achieved through the analysis of intensive data generated by the simulation of any possible scenario in the real system. The challenge is to provide knowledge of critical, non-usual or extreme situations. Simulation is the only way to obtain information about these kinds of situations, as it is not possible to test such scenarios in the real system. We show how simulation of the real system through advanced computing is a source of big data, as it allows rapid and massive data generation. The potential of high performance computing makes it possible to generate a very large amount of data within a reasonable time, store this data, then process and analyze it to obtain knowledge. We describe the methodology proposed for this goal, which is based on the use of the simulator as a sensor of the real system, and so as the main source of data. The application of data mining techniques will open the doors to knowledge. To verify that the proposed methodology works, we propose a case study in which the aim is to obtain knowledge from a set of data already available, obtained from the simulation of a reduced set of scenarios of the real system.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4357-9; POD:978-1-4799-4356-2","10.1109/FiCloud.2014.65","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984221","Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS);Big Data;Data Mining (DM);Decision Support Systems (DSS);Emergency Department (ED);Knowledge Discovery","Analytical models;Big data;Computational modeling;Data mining;Data models;Hospitals","Big Data;data mining;digital simulation;medical information systems","big data;data mining techniques;hospital emergency department;knowledge discovery;quality of service;simulation","","1","","21","","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica.

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2363986","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949053","Cyber–physical social networks;Cyber???physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion","Algorithm design and analysis;Behavioral science;Complex networks;Context modeling;Design methodology;Global Positioning System;Internet;Internet of things;Market research;Media;Medical services;Public policy;Social factors;Social network services","Internet of Things;mobile computing;social networking (online);social sciences computing","Internet of Things;big data;cyber world;data-driven analysis;interpersonal trust;online network;physical network;smartphone;social persuasion","","4","","34","","","20141106","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. This editorial paper presents a snapshot of recent developments in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the I-Health perspective. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these recent developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging concept.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3351-8; POD:978-1-4799-7527-3","10.1109/WCCAIS.2014.6916635","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916635","android;i-health;internet of things;wireless sensors","Medical services;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Smart phones;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;health care;smart phones;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","Android;I-Health systems;Internet of Things;WSN;intelligent healthcare system;wireless communications technology;wireless sensor network","","0","","18","","","","17-19 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is not just things connected to the Internet - it is intelligent systems that we will be able to build on top of IoT that will introduce us to a better quality of life. However, IoT is facing a major problem: fragmentation and interoperability problems.

The industry must adopt current standards and provide interoperability among other systems and developers must be aware of this issue too.

A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research.

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803112","Body Area Networks;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage","Decision support systems;Internet","body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks","bandwidth consumption;healthcare;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;power consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;statistical techniques;wireless human gait monitoring system","","0","","5","","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations.

Electronic innovation is becoming increasingly more important in the evolution of our society. Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile. We will explore how these automotive trends translate to future challenges for technology platforms, integrated circuit module development, system-on-chip integration, design of safe systems, and implementation of secure but diagnosable systems.","2164-1676;21641676","Electronic:978-1-4799-1166-0; POD:978-1-4799-1165-3","10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749653","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6749653","","Joints","automotive electronics;road safety;system-on-chip","Internet of Things;accelerated system;automobile;autonomous driving system;communication infrastructure;decision making;detection classification;electronic innovation;emission standards;functional blocks;integrated circuit module development;integrated sensing systems;multiple diverse software environments;safe system design;secure domain controllers;system-on-chip integration;vehicle network","","0","","","","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a multiplier is proposed in the open literature. We have performed complexity analysis for the proposed lightweight architectures, and the results show that the hardware complexity of the proposed superserial multiplier is reduced compared with that of regular serial multipliers. This has been also confirmed through our application-specific integrated circuit hardware- and time-equivalent estimations.

Each tremor assessment task lasts for 10 seconds. A total of 5 patients with tremor were tested with the first prototype. Time-frequency analysis and statistical analysis were realized based on the inertial measurement unit signals. Results indicate that the tremor frequency was stable for all patients; however, the tremor amplitude fluctuated all the time. Valid state detection algorithm was performed for each assessment task. The mean tremor amplitudes of valid rest and postural tremor tasks correlate well with the clinical scores.

In addition, these systems can sometimes suffer from interference from existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is both comfortable to use and does not encounter interference with existing wireless traffic is required. This paper presents a system design that includes a probe, sensor, radio, and receiver for a long term heart rate monitoring in a senior center.

In this study, we propose a persuasion method which integrates machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion for enhancing adherence, and we design a mobile application Win-Win ASleep (WWaS). We performed a 6-week study to evaluate the usability of WWaS on enhancing behavioral and recording adherence in comparison to a paper-based diary. Results show that machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion enhanced the adherence of patients in different manner, and WWaS assists users keeping a sleep diary accurate and complete.

With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5616-9; POD:978-1-4673-5615-2","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548958","6LoWPAN;IEEE802.15.4;U-Healthcare;WBAN;WSN","Accelerometers;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Protocols;Real-time systems;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;health care;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing","IEEE802.15.4;Internet of Things;Labview program;TCP client;TCP/IP;Zigbee;bluetooth;communication platform;edge router;gateway application;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;interoperability problem;next generation u-healthcare system;real-time healthcare monitoring;real-time monitoring;remote PC;smart devices;u-healthcare systems;ubiquitous healthcare","","9","","15","","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, any smart device can be used as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things for information interaction. It will be the new research aspect for Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) to regard the human brain (the most intelligent “device”) as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things and to construct the network based on the human brains (we name it as Internet of Brains). In this paper, a model of wearable affective computing was proposed for discriminating different emotional states and constructing the Internet of Brains, by means of effective connectivity of EEG-based brain network. Firstly, we proposed a rational emotion-induced psychological experiment to collect the EEG data under different emotional states. Then, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to decompose different independent components based on different emotional states; Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was utilized to detect the interactive dependencies between each independent component in order to construct the causal connectivity brain network (CCBN); Dynamic characteristics, including causal density and causal flow of the CCBN, were extracted based on Graph Theory. Finally, the corresponding law between characteristics of EEG pattern and “inner” emotional state was discovered to establish affective computing model. Furthermore, the model of wearable affective computing was constructed based on above law with the portable EEG acquisition device, and prototype system of wearable affective computing based on Internet of Brains was achieved for BCI.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5214-7; POD:978-1-4673-5213-0","10.1109/ICCMA.2013.6506157","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6506157","Causal Connectivity Brain Network;Granger Causality;Independent Component Analysis;Internet of Brains;Wearable Affective Computing","Affective computing;Analytical models;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Electroencephalography;Internet","Internet of Things;brain;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;graph theory;independent component analysis;medical signal processing","CCBN;EEG acquisition device;EEG-based emotion recognition;Granger causality;ICA;Internet of Things;Internet-of-brains;brain imaging technology;brain network;brain-computer interface;causal connectivity brain network;causal density characteristics;causal flow characteristics;cognitive status;electroencephalography;graph theory;human emotion change;independent component analysis;information technology;neuroscience;psychiatric disorder;rational emotion-induced psychological experiment;wearable affective computing","","2","","25","","","","20-22 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform-based in-home healthcare station is proposed.

"The future of cloud integration: Cloud Middleware?","M. Sain","Dongseo University, Busan, Republic of Korea","2013 15th International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology (ICACT)","20130328","2013","","","1","1","As we know cloud computing can be defined in many ways, but in simple terms ""the cloud"" can be called as a metaphor for the Internet, which is quite familiar cliche, but when it combined with ""computing,"" the meaning gets bigger and fuzzier. Several analyst and service vendors define cloud computing as an updated version of Service oriented computing with virtualization: basically virtual servers available over the Internet. In this regard Charles Babcock definition of Cloud Computing serves very well which says, ""one of the secrets of cloud computing is that cloud software reflects a new architecture that best exploits the clustered resources around it. It exploits them in such a way that one instance of the software potentially can serve hundreds or thousands of users, and a handful of instances can serve hundreds of thousands."" Cloud Computing is needed to address the dynamic, exponentially growing demands for real-time, reliable data processing of 'Internet of Things' . The future of cloud computing services is heading towards offerings of flexible development and deployment environments. The cloud, with its vast elasticity and democratization of software access to end users, has created challenging software delivery problems like cost efficiency delivery, scalability, and the need for codification of critical operating workflows. If we remember middleware/infrastructure software has provided a common layer that acts as a single point of interest shared by IT network level operators and software developers. For example IIS, WebSphere, database servers, etc. typically provide a wealth of tooling to network folks in support of applications. Here cloud middleware system integrators may determine the future adoption of cloud computing. These systems normally support open platform stacks, provide generic interfaces between components, support infrastructure abstraction, and utilize standard communication frameworks. There are several proposed solution available wh- ch are known as Cloud Middleware such as Carbon 3.0, WS02, SaaSGrid, Sky Computing, Altocumulus etc. In this tutorial we would like to explore the future of cloud middleware and will discuss about what are the challenges ahead in cloud computing as well as cloud Integration. We will also take a look on some existing cloud middleware and see how they are helpful in cloud computing as well what are the future scopes for middleware in cloud computing.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-89-968650-1-8; POD:978-1-4673-3148-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488122","","Embedded systems;Medical services","Internet of Things;cloud computing;middleware;service-oriented architecture","Altocumulus;Carbon 3.0;IIS;IT network level operator;Internet of Things;SaaSGrid;Sky Computing;WS02;WebSphere;cloud computing service;cloud middleware system integration;cloud software;clustered resource;communication framework;component interface;cost efficiency delivery;critical operating workflow;database server;infrastructure abstraction;infrastructure software;open platform stack;real-time reliable data processing;service oriented computing;software access;software architecture;software delivery problem;software developers;virtual server;virtualization","","0","","","","","","27-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable ""things"" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which ""things"" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4684-1; POD:978-1-4673-1328-5","10.1109/IMIS.2012.109","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296947","Ambient Intelligent;DomoNet;E-Health;Machine Learning;Ontology;SOA;XML;domotics;home automation","Ambient intelligence;Context;Monitoring;Ontologies;Semantics;Senior citizens","data structures;ecology;embedded systems;emergency services;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Internet of Things;Internet-capable things;ambient intelligence;artificial intelligence techniques;automated home;computational significance;digital traces;distributed environmental context information;domestic environment;e-health system;embedded intelligence;emergency situations;everyday life;health hazards anticipation;human behavior;intelligent ecosystem;intelligent things;interoperability;machine learning;natural abstraction;occupants behaviors;ontology-based IoT domotic environment;semantic Web;semantic knowledge representation;technology-independent manner","","7","","15","","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reach these services and feedback capabilities, it is required a full integration of the clinical devices and efficient processing of the collected data. The presented knowledge acquisition and management architecture is composed of, on the one hand, a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the integration of clinical devices, wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. On the other hand, it is complemented with a data model and pre-processing module called YOAPY, which analyses the data from the sensors at the personal devices level. This offers an enriched data to the knowledge-based systems, and this also aggregate the data acquired in order to improve the performance of the communications to the constrains from the Smart Objects in aspects such as low bandwidth, frame size and power consumption.

At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality.

Among these features, the flexibility of the network requires nodes to apply corresponding measures when scene changes. For example, in emergency situations (e.g. an accident occurs, and a doctor is needed), the location of the user is available, while under normal circumstances, the user's location information is confidential. This paper is in the background of the above scene to present an identity based system for personal location in emergency situations. The proposed system consists of registration subsystem, user authentication subsystem, policy subsystem and client subsystem. The system confirms the identity of the user through the user authentication subsystem and gets the level of the emergency through the policy subsystem. Then it can make sure that user's location information can be accessed only by some authorized user, and only when necessary. The proposed system strengthens the protection of the user's privacy while providing the location of the user, and prevents the disclosure of the users' information.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-159-5; POD:978-1-61284-158-8","10.1109/ICBNMT.2011.6155923","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6155923","emergency situations;internet of things (IOT);privacy;security;virtual identity","Accidents;Authentication;Internet;Medical services;Privacy;Servers","Internet;authorisation;data privacy;emergency services;message authentication","IOT;Internet of things;authorized user;client subsystem;emergency situation;identity-based personal location system;network flexibility;policy subsystem;protected privacy;registration subsystem;security features;security requirement;user authentication subsystem;user identity;user location;user privacy protection;virtual identity","","6","","10","","","","28-30 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6271-1; POD:978-1-4244-6270-4","10.1109/ITNG.2010.104","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501633","Near Field Communication (NFC);Pervasive Healthcare;RFID;Telemedicine;eHealth","Ambient intelligence;Communications technology;Decision making;IP networks;Medical services;Pervasive computing;Radiofrequency identification;Safety;Senior citizens;Web and internet services","Internet;handicapped aids;health care","Internet of things;KIT technology;ambient assisted living;closed loop healthcare services;keep in touch;near field communication;people-to-people communication;radio frequency identification;smart homes;technological advancements;telemonitoring processes","","98","3","16","","","","12-14 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6606-1; POD:978-1-4244-6605-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470547","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470547","Ambient Assisted Living;Barcode;Internet of things;NFC;Ontology;Rule-Based System","Artificial intelligence;Cellular phones;Costs;Drugs;Hospitals;Information systems;Intelligent systems;Internet;Knowledge based systems;Pharmaceuticals","Internet;drug delivery systems;knowledge based systems;medical information systems","Internet-of-things;active ingredients;adverse drugs reaction;allergy interactions;electronic health record;near field communication;nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance;pharmaceutical intelligent information system","","10","","18","","","","March 29 2010-April 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults.

First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation.

The pressure to expand the device supplying model depends on each application market, so such status of each application is to be discussed and also whether the expansion of the model is really necessary and practical or not.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4089-9; POD:978-1-4799-4088-2","10.1109/ASSCC.2014.7008941","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008941","","Awards activities;Committees;Educational institutions;Electrical engineering;Medical services;Mobile communication;Patents","Internet of Things;elemental semiconductors;large scale integration;silicon","Internet of Things;IoT;LSI designers;PC;Si;silicon value;smartphone","","0","","","","","","10-12 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities","A. Sheth","Wright State Univ., Dayton, OH, USA","2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","20150108","2014","","","2","3","Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain an- the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5666-1; POD:978-1-4799-5667-8","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004204","","","Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","Big Data;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity;Big Data volume;continuous semantics;domain models;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;metadata;ontologies;personalized digital health;semantic interoperability;semantic perception;smart data;vocabularies","","1","","","","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
