Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out.

However, with the adoption of IoT, new challenges arise, such as the design of architectures able to support the requirements of the new applications. Towards this goal, we explore a three layered architecture, able to acquire, process and store Healthcare data as well as to provide real-time decision making.

In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2324-4; POD:978-1-5386-2325-1; USB:978-1-5386-2323-7","10.1109/MASS.2017.62","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108772","Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing;Shannon Mapping","Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Medical services;Power demand;Sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic","AJSCC device;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;Analog Signal compression;FPMM receiver;FPMM technique;IoT applications;IoT devices;IoT scalability;SNR operating region;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;analog domain;analog encoding;encoding method;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;healthcare Internet of Things;joint modulation;mean square error;miss detection rate;multiplexing technique;multisignal compression method;power consumption;power saving;traffic data","","","","","","","","22-25 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and access by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while prevent unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system which supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2017.2751640","AXA Research Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Research Foundation Singapore; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8036213","access control;break-glass;healthcare system;lightweight;secure IoT","Access control;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Cryptography;Hip;Informatics;Medical services","","","","","","","","","20170913","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback.

This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions.

The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363124","","Computers;Conferences;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing","Internet of Things;health care;public key cryptography","DTLS session resumption technique;IoT;end-to-end security;energy performance evaluations;healthcare Internet-of-Things;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;remote end-users;remote patient monitoring prototype;security context;session resumption technique;smart gateways","","3","","22","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism.

Mobile and wearable devices that have sensing and Internet access capabilities offer the opportunity of changing how medical services are delivered to the patients. The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology. The protocol stacks of the edge router and router are validated through successful connectivity tests and packet drop tests. The single-hop communication latency is also measured to give an indication of the overheads introduced by the stack.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7645-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-7646-1; POD:978-1-4799-7647-8","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.74","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307037","6LoWPAN;Internet of Things;pervasive healthcare;ultra-low power miniaturized mote","IP networks;Internet;Medical services;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet of Things;biomedical communication;health care;intelligent sensors;medical computing;patient monitoring;personal area networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","IPv6 accessibility;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet access capabilities;WSN;bare metal 6LoWPAN protocol;connectivity tests;edge router;embedded BAN supporting tree topology;healthcare services;medical services;mobile devices;packet drop tests;patient body area networks;power constraints;protocol stacks;router stack;single-hop communication latency;ultra-low power embedded mote;vital sign monitoring;wearable Internet of Things mote;wearable devices;wireless sensor networks","","1","","20","","","","9-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems.

Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the Intensive Care Unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a bio-sensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real-time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system act as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application.

Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose a- innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing.

However, these scenarios will critically rely on the large-scale deployed sensors that constantly transmit streaming data to cloud platform for real-time estimation, which brings the issue of privacy disclosure since smart devices will gather kinds of data including personal sensitive information. Meanwhile, there is not some universal method to solve privacy problem in 5G because of diversified security needs for different applications. In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter based differentially private steaming data share scheme is proposed to protect user privacy for cloud platform in IoT. The proposed method can ensure that released data will not compromise individual privacy, and improve the utility of released data simultaneously. The proposed scheme is evaluated by four real-world datasets and compared with the results of utility optimization scheme based on Kalman filter. Experiments show that the proposed scheme enhances the utility of released streaming data under the premise of effective privacy preserving and achieve better practicability and validity.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2797159","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267193","5G;IoT;differential privacy;privacy protection;streaming data","5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Kalman filters;Privacy;Security;Smart homes","","","","","","","","","20180123","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. The present paper address some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a Secure Digital Camera (SDC) integrated with the Secure Better Portable Graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this work is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection: concurrent encryption and watermarking which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management (DRM). The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: (1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image, and (2) frequency domain watermarking using block-wise DCT of size 8×8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant incre- se of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795478","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8263198","Better Portable Graphics;Consumer Electronics;Image Communications;Internet of Things (IoT);Secure Digital Camera;Smart Healthcare","Computer architecture;Digital cameras;Image coding;Medical services;Watermarking","","","","","","","","","20180118","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Skarmeta","","Interacting with Computers","20180118","2014","26","2","145","168","Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the us- rs and the system, are demonstrated.","0953-5438;09535438","","10.1093/iwc/iwt030","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155471","assistive technologies;novel interaction paradigms;systems and tools for interaction design;ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools;ubiquitous and mobile devices;usability testing","","","","","","","","","","","March 2014","","OUP","OUP Journals & Magazines"

Internet of things (IoT) is an implementation of smart nodes that sense the data, interpret, process and give response within a required time in a network. The ability to embed sensing devices into real environment enables the transformation of smart environment. However, there is a very little practical use of IoT infrastructure in real life. Many traditional approaches are proposed by researchers that do not address this issue correctly. We have focused on the smart sewerage system of a smart city in this paper. The sewerage system is represented by a graph in which a junction is assumed as a node and flow of water is represented as a directed edge in the graph theory. The flow of water is controlled by defining a safe path from one junction to another by predicting behavior of water and safe state of the system. The graph based model is transformed into a formal model using Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL).

Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities.

Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner.

With the increase in patient population, remotely prioritizing and diagnosing patients becomes a major problem. Research has been conducted to address this issue. However, many models fail to support the condition of comorbidity. In this paper, we developed a multi-task machine learning model that supports remote patient prioritization based on disease severity. This model not only considers patients diagnosed with a single disease, but also acknowledges comorbidity of a patient to calculate their severity utilizing physiological data. Classifying a comorbid patient based on their disease(s) severity is a challenging task. We achieve this by exploiting the commonalities and differences between the diseases using multi-task machine learning. Based on the correlation between diseases, we classify the patient into appropriate severity level. In addition to this, our model also supports continuous patient monitoring based on their severity levels, which is made possible by implementing in Apache Spark.

These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1324-5; POD:978-1-5386-1325-2","10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251290","Haar transform;Haar wavelet;IoT;clustering;correlation;distance measure;healthcare;time series","Correlation;Euclidean distance;Market research;Medical services;Physiology;Time series analysis;Transforms","","","","","","","","","","23-25 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1392-4; POD:978-1-5386-1393-1; USB:978-1-5386-1391-7","10.1109/HIC.2017.8227623","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227623","","Aging;Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Instruments;Monitoring;Sociology;Stability analysis","Internet of Things;assisted living;body sensor networks;cloud computing;gait analysis;handicapped aids;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sensor fusion","assistive device;assistive technologies;chronic disease;cloud storage;deployable gait monitoring;discrete gait monitoring;gait cycles;global healthcare system;health monitoring;hybrid sensorized canes;mobile device;mobility impairments;multisensor IoT;multisensor fusion algorithm;particular impairments;unobtrusive activity monitoring;walkers;wearable devices","","","","","","","","6-8 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors.

Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information.

A need-based HMM-IOT hybrid has been used for the smart hospital scheme proposed here, and it continuously synchronizes itself with the current spectral analysis data of the bio-signals of the admitted patients acquired by non-invasive processes like Electroencephalogram, Electromyogram, Electrocardiogram etc. The results of the experimentation are really promising.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3038-5; POD:978-1-5090-3039-2","10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204069","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8204069","Hidden Markov Models;Hospital Information System;Internet of Things;Smart hospitals;Spectral Analysis","Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Hidden Markov models;Hospitals;Internet of Things;Synchronization","Internet of Things;hidden Markov models;hospitals;medical information systems;probability","HMM-IOT hybrid;Hospital Information System;Internet of Things;current spectral analysis data;dynamic probabilistic nature;hidden Markov model;hybrid driven smart hospital;predictive analysis","","","","","","","","3-5 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN) is a special kind of the generic IoT network, which is composed of the different nodes such as the gateway node, cluster head nodes and sensing nodes organized in a hierarchy In HIoTN, there is a need where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool. UAKMP offers several functionality features including offline sensing node registration, freely password and biometric update facility, user anonymity and sensing node anonymity compared to other related existing schemes. In addition, UAKMP is also comparable in computation and communication costs as compared to other existing schemes.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780232","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8168328","AVISPA simulation.;Generic IoT network;authentication;hierarchical IoT network;key management;security","Authentication;Internet of Things;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20171206","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data.

The IoT devices equipped with sensors are changing every domain of the world to become smarter. In particular, the majorly benifited service sectors are agriculture, industries, healthcare, control & automation, retail & logistics, and power & energy. The data generated in these areas is massive requiring bigger storage and stronger compute. On the other hand, the IoT devices are limited in processing and storage capabilities and can not store and process the sensed data locally. Hence, there is a dire need to integrate these devices with the external data sources for effective utilisation and assessment of the collected data. Several existing well-known message exchange protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are applicable in IoT communications. However, a thorough study is required to understand their impact and suitability in IoT scenario for the exchange of information between external data sources and IoT devices. In this paper, we designed and implemented an application layer framework to test and understand the behavior of these protocols and conducted the experiments on a realistic test bed using wired, wifi and 2/3/4G networks. The results revealed that MQTT and AMQP perform well on wired and wireless connections whereas CoAP performs consistently well and is less network dependent. On the lossy networks, CoAP generates low traffic as compared to MQTT and AMQP.

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data.

Due to the criticality and sensitivity of the data in the healthcare domain, ensuring the S&P of the Internet of medical things (IoMT) makes matters even more problematic. Lack of proper S&P in IoMT will not only leave patients' privacy at risk but may also put patients' lives at risk. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the S&P issues of IoMT. We also provide an approach to quantify IoMT risks and demonstrate how to assess risks in two IoMT devices.

Although the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services towards 5G.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2772959","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105799","5G.;Big data;Emotion-aware healthcare;IoT;emotion recognition;local binary pattern","5G mobile communication;Big Data;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Medical services;Speech;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20171113","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end to end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSN), to incorporating the internet of things (IoT), to communication links, to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise is of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and the future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level towards the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision - aking regarding their PHI/EHR. A lot of work and effort is necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/ pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767561","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8089328","Access Control;Anonymity;Privacy;e-Healthcare","Access control;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Medical services;Privacy;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20171030","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

"ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare","A. Walinjkar; J. Woods","Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering University of Essex Colchester, Essex","2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)","20171009","2017","","","1","8","A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered a- d relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5057-4; POD:978-1-5090-5058-1","10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057360","ECG classification;FHIR;GP Connect;HL7;MITDB;Physionet;Wearable IoT;arrhythmia Neural-Net;arrhythmia detection;preventive health-care;real-time ECG","Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Heart;Monitoring;Real-time systems","Web services;biomedical telemetry;cardiology;data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;health care;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;patient monitoring;pattern matching;real-time systems;signal classification;telemedicine","3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit;ECG abnormalities;ECG equipment;ECG readings;ECG waveforms;Electronic Health Record;abnormal ECG events;arrhythmia classification;cure institutions;health care;k-NN Classification models;machine learning phase;misclassification error value;modern wearable health monitoring devices;neuralnet fitting models;personalized healthcare;potential health hazards;prediction models;prediction tasks;real-time ECG Classification;real-time analyses;tele health analytical server;timely medical treatment;trained classification models;unique feature extraction method;wearable biomedical devices;wearable devices;wearable systems","","","","","","","","19-20 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation.

Use of Centralized and Distributed anomaly detection methods suffer from significant latency and energy consumption issues. Hence, we propose a novel anomaly detection method, called Fog-Empowered anomaly detection, by harnessing the processing power of the Fog computing platform and using an efficient hyperellipsoidal clustering algorithm. The end nodes in the Fog computing architecture do not perform any processing or clustering on the data. The Fog layer and the Cloud layer nodes perform the clustering and anomaly detection process, thus helping to achieve anomaly detection in a timely manner.

However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based Internet of Things (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2759728","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057766","Internet of Tings;Markov decision process;Q learning;cognitive networks;deep learning.","Bit error rate;Internet of Things;Machine learning;Relays;Scheduling;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20171004","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Researchers or developers associated with these domains frequently require diverse types of IoT devices to implement or test their IoT related innovations. However, building an IoT-testbed by purchasing these IoT devices in every few months is infeasible considering that most of them will be used only for a small amount of time and will become obsolete with the arrival of an upgraded version of those devices. Instead, a better approach would be rented out the IoT devices in on-demand, just-in-time, and pay for only the time the devices are used basis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose IoTbed - an architecture to deliver a large scale Testbed as a service using the IoT devices located in the users' proximal networks. IoTbed enables testbed providers to build their testbeds in the edge of the network and allows easy and secure access for IoT service providers to run experiments on those testbeds. IoTbed presents an economic model that offers monetary incentives to the device owners for using their devices in the testbed experiments. We posit that such an incentive model will encourage more testbed providers to rent out their smart devices through IoTbed. To demonstrate the feasibility of IoTbed, we implemented a prototype of IoTbed to run on Contiki powered IoT devices and evaluated the performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2011-3; POD:978-1-5386-2012-0; USB:978-1-5386-2010-6","10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.14","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039053","Architecture;Contiki;Cooja;Incentive;Internet of Things;Testbed","Big Data;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Logic gates;Monitoring;ZigBee","Internet of Things","Internet of Things-based systems;IoT devices;IoT related innovations;IoT service providers;IoTbed;smart devices;testbed providers;users proximal networks","","","","","","","","25-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT), edge and cloud computing technologies, we propose an architecture which is capable of providing cloud based clinical services using human activity data. Such services could supplement the shortage of staff in primary healthcare centers thereby reducing the burden on healthcare service providers. The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients.

This makes it even harder to match personal data from incoming devices. This paper proposes a traceability route formation using a network graph based on techniques such as tuple of inputs and the Büchi automaton.

In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes. The system is flexible and can incorporate more policy rules, professionals, and data classes.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0752-7; POD:978-1-5386-0753-4","10.1109/ICWS.2017.111","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029854","Internet of Things;access control;ambient assisted living;authentication;multi-level access control","Access control;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;authorisation;data privacy;health care;home computing;medical computing;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;public key cryptography","ABAC;Internet of Things;IoT;IoT-based healthcare systems;PKI;ambient home solution framework;ambient sensors;attribute-based access control;biometric sensors;collected healthcare data;data classes;healthcare domain;high-level activity recognition task;mobile medical applications;multilevel access control;multilevel privacy-preserving Access Control;personal healthcare monitoring;privacy-preserving monitoring;public key infrastructure;security policies","","","","","","","","25-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Analytics over Arbitrarily Partitioned Data","S. Mehnaz; E.

In many situations, multiple parties would share data towards a common goal if it were possible to simultaneously protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations described in the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics require parties to transfer their raw data to a trusted mediator, who then performs the desired analysis on the global data, and shares the results with the parties. Unfortunately, such a solution does not fit many applications where privacy is a strong concern such as healthcare, finance and the internet-of-things. Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy, in this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving multi-party analytics, where the goal is to enable analytics on multi-party data without compromising the data privacy of each individual party. We propose a secure gradient descent algorithm that enables analytics on data that is arbitrarily partitioned among multiple parties. The proposed algorithm is generic and applies to a wide class of machine learning problems. We demonstrate our solution for a popular use-case (i.e., regression), and evaluate the performance of the proposed secure solution in terms of accuracy, latency and communication cost. We also perform a scalability analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution as the data size and the number of parties increase.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1993-3; POD:978-1-5386-1994-0; USB:978-1-5386-1992-6","10.1109/CLOUD.2017.51","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030607","Multi-party Analytics;Privacy","Cryptography;Data privacy;Hospitals;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols","business data processing;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);trusted computing","arbitrarily partitioned data;data privacy;data size;data-driven business processes;enterprises;global data;individual party;internet-of-things;machine learning problems;multiparty data;privacy-preserving multiparty analytics;raw data;secure gradient descent algorithm;trusted mediator","","","","","","","","25-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yang","Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong","IEEE Access","20170906","2017","5","","16441","16458","In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2739804","10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC Key Project; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002920 - RGC General Research Fund; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010408","Edge devices;Internet of Things;distributed computing;distributed intelligence;mesh network","Cloud computing;Decision making;Edge computing;Resource management;Security;Sensors;Servers","Internet of Things;cloud computing;embedded systems;internetworking;mobility management (mobile radio);network servers;open systems;software fault tolerance","ICT;Internet-of-Things;IoT;centralized cloud computing;centralized server;communication capabilities;communication interoperability;computation capabilities;context awareness;decision-making tasks;distributed intelligence;distributed processing;edge computing;edge mesh computing paradigm;embedded devices;fault tolerance;fog computing;gateway devices;healthcare;intelligent transportation system;mobility support;real-time processing;smart home;software framework;task allocation problem;task management framework","","","","","","","20170814","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3035-8; POD:978-1-5386-3036-5","10.1109/CBI.2017.34","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010750","Assisted Living;Dementia care;Internet of Things;Multicriteria evaluation;e-Health","Dementia;Industries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;analytic hierarchy process;diseases;health care","AHP;Internet of Things;IoT;analytic hierarchy process;chronic diseases;dementia care;health care services;multicriteria evaluation;special needs","","","","","","","","24-27 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features.

Since MC is directly inspired by communication processes in biological cells, the engineering of biological circuits through cells' genetic code manipulation, which enables access to the cells' information processing abilities, is a candidate technology for the future realization of MC components. In this paper, inspired by previous research on channel coding schemes for MC and biological circuits for cell communications, a joint encoder and modulator design is proposed for the transmission of cellular information through signaling molecules. In particular, the information encoding and modulation are based on a binary parity check scheme, and they are implemented by interconnecting biological circuit components based on gene expression and mass action reactions. Each component is mathematically modeled and tuned according to the desired output. The implementation of the biological circuit in a simulation environment is then presented along with the corresponding numerical results, which validate the proposed design by showing agreement with an ideal encoding and modulator scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8999-0; POD:978-1-4673-9000-2","10.1109/ICC.2017.7997032","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997032","Hill function;Molecular communication;biochemical simulation;biological circuit;chemical reaction modeling;parity-check encoding","Biological information theory;Cells (biology);Chemicals;Encoding;Gene expression;Modulation;Proteins","Internet of Things;binary codes;biocommunications;cellular biophysics;channel coding;genetic engineering;modulation coding;molecular communication (telecommunication);parity check codes","Internet of Things;MC;binary parity check scheme;biological cells;biological circuit component interconnection;biological circuit design;cell communications;cell genetic code manipulation;cellular information transmission;channel coding schemes;gene expression;information encoding and modulation;mass action reactions;modulated parity-check encoding;molecular communication","","","","","","","","21-25 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723843","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through the Post-Doctoral Research Fellow Dr. V.

This transformation is facilitated by embedded devices, collectively known as Internet of Things (IoT), which produce real-time feeds of sensor data which are collected and processed to produce a dynamic physical model used for optimized real-time decision making. At the infrastructure level, there is a need to develop a scalable architecture for processing massive volumes of present and historical data at an unprecedented velocity to support the IoT paradigm. To cope with such extreme scale, we argue for the need to revisit the hardware and software co-design landscape in light of two key technological advancements. First is the virtualization of computation and storage over highly distributed data centers spanning across continents. Second is the emergence of a variety of specialized hardware accelerators that complement traditional general-purpose processors. Further efforts are required to unify these two trends in order to harness the power of big data. In this paper, we present a formulation and characterization of the hardware acceleration landscape geared towards real-time analytics in the cloud.

Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements.

In the authors' system, the GP-generated attackers targeted publish-subscribe communications within a wireless sensor networks that was protected by an artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS) taken from the literature. The GP attackers successfully suppressed more legitimate messages than the hand-coded attack used originally to test the IDS, whilst reducing the likelihood of detection.

This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2716344","10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council Future Fellowships; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950903","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;energy harvesting;maximum power point tracking;wireless body area network","Body area networks;Maximum power point trackers;Solar energy;Solar panels;Temperature measurement;Wearable sensors;Wireless communication","Bluetooth;Internet;Internet of Things;body area networks;computerised monitoring;energy harvesting;health care;mobile computing;patient monitoring;wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth low energy transmission;Internet of Things;IoT connected healthcare applications;Web-based smartphone application;autonomous WBAN;autonomous wireless body area network;continuous medical monitoring;flexible solar energy harvester;output-based maximum power point tracking technique;solar energy harvesting;time 24 h;wearable sensor node","","1","","","","OAPA","20170616","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules.

This connection will have impact on many sectors of our life such as industry, economy, social life, and ICT sector. Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT.

Jo","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","2017","PP","99","1","1","The recent proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and wearable devices has given rise to crowdsourcing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure threefactor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card, 2) password and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Burrows- Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic.

The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world.

One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups.

Existing IoT architectures are highly centralized and heavily rely on a back-end core network for all decision-making processes. This may lead to inefficiencies in terms of latency, network traffic management, computational processing, and power consumption. In this paper, we advocate the empowerment of front-end IoT devices to support the back-end network in fulfilling end-user applications requirements mainly by means of improved connectivity and efficient network management. A novel conceptual framework is presented for a new generation of IoT devices that will enable multiple new features for both the IoT administrators as well as end users. Exploiting the recent emergence of software-defined architecture, these smart IoT devices will allow fast, reliable, and intelligent management of diverse IoT-based applications.

However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2600633","Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education; Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Nature Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002865 - Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing Science and Technology Commission; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546882","I.I.D. multi-armed bandit;channel-grouping;fairness access scheme;modified UCB-tuned","Agriculture;Cognitive radio;Internet of things;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cognitive radio;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;cognitive radio technology;distributed learning algorithm;fair channel-grouping scheme;multi armed bandit channel access scheme;spectrum scarcity problem;water-filling principle;wireless sensor networks","","10","","","","OAPA","20160817","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IETF has standardized the RPL routing protocol to provide the interoperability for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). LLNs cover a wide scope of applications, such as building automation, industrial control, healthcare, and so on. LLNs applications require reliable and energy-efficient routing support. Point-to-point (P2P) communication is a fundamental requirement of many LLNs applications. However, traditional routing protocols usually propagate throughout the whole network to discover a reliable P2P route, which requires large amount energy consumption. Again, it is challenging to achieve both reliability and energy-efficiency simultaneously, especially for LLNs. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient region-based routing protocol (ER-RPL), which achieves energy-efficient data delivery without compromising reliability. In contrast of traditional routing protocols where all nodes are required for route discovery, the proposed scheme only requires a subset of nodes to do the job, which is the key of energy saving. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies demonstrate that ER-RPL has a great performance superiority over two conventional benchmark protocols, i.e., RPL and P2P-RPL.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2593438","Early Career Scheme; University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; 10.13039/100006978 - BEARS has been established by the University of California at Berkeley as a center for intellectual excellence in research and education in Singapore; 10.13039/501100001381 - Republic of Singapore¿s National Research Foundation (NRF) through a grant to the Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore (BEARS) for the Singapore-Berkeley Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics (SinBerBEST)Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004377 - The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516707","Energy-efficiency;low-power and lossy networks (LLNs);point-to-point (P2P) communication;region-based;reliability;routing protocol (RPL)","Energy consumption;Internet of things;Reliability;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computer network reliability;energy conservation;energy consumption;machine-to-machine communication;open systems;routing protocols;telecommunication power management","ER-RPL;IETF;Internet of Things;LLN;P2P communication;energy consumption;energy saving;energy-efficient data delivery;energy-efficient region-based RPL routing protocol;interoperability;low-power and lossy network;machine-to-machine communication;point-to-point communication;route discovery","","7","","","","","20160719","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.","1932-4545;19324545","","10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2591923","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant; 10.13039/501100001381 - National Research Foundation Singapore; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737055","Hybrid compression;internet-of-things;lossless;lossy;wearable devices;wireless sensors","Data compression;Electrocardiography;Hybrid power systems;Propagation losses;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;biomedical communication;data compression;electrocardiography;entropy codes;health care;medical signal processing;radio transceivers;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth transceiver;ECG;Internet-of-Things;IoT wireless sensors;adaptive data rate selection;compression ratio;data transmission scheme;decompressed lossy data;electrocardiogram;entropy coding;healthcare applications;hybrid data compression scheme;hybrid transmission mode;lossless compression;lossless transmission;lossy compression technique;power reduction;wireless transmission","","3","","","","","20161107","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties.

Meanwhile, Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) have proved themselves to be promising tools for driving and managing devices within IoT systems. However, past works have not fully addressed how the IoT-based BPMS can continue their execution when the involved IoT devices do not have a reliable Internet connection. In this paper, we propose a system design for decentralised device-to-device (D2D)-based BP execution, where mobile nodes have the capability of both executing BPs but also migrating BP execution to other nodes during runtime. We apply this design to the field of smart logistics, in order to enable smart goods monitoring. The presented goods monitoring solution enables reacting to events as soon as they occur, while also generating a trace of the monitoring execution history. A prototype focusing on the migration functionality of the platform has been implemented and tested to evaluate its performance in the context of the mentioned smart logistics scenario.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.69","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917097","Business Process Management Systems;Business Process Migration;Device-to-Device;Goods Monitoring;Internet of Things;Smart Logistics","Companies;History;Logistics;Monitoring;Sensors;Transportation","Internet;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication","BPMS;Internet connection;IoT-enabled information system;WiseWare;agriculture;decentralised D2D-based BP execution;device-to-device-based business process management system;healthcare;industrial Internet of Things;mobile nodes;smart goods monitoring;smart logistics","","1","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Securely gathering sensor measurements by adopting traditional cryptographic mechanisms is fraught with vulnerabilities emanating from the inability to safeguard secrets on edge devices, often in adversarial environments, where appropriate hardware protection logic and power consumption overheads are counterproductive to the desire to keep the devices low cost and long lasting. This paper continues recent efforts into investigating an alternative secure sensing approach with the potential to provide a solution for resource-restricted IoT devices. In particular, we investigate the possibility to exploit unreliability of a physical unclonable function (PUF) resulting from its sensitivity to variations in supply voltage conditions to guarantee the veracity of physical measurements from potentially any transducer capable of converting a physical phenomenon to a voltage signal. Therefore we present an approach that has the potential to realize a universal PUF sensor where the PUF itself acts as a sensor or is integrated with a sensor. Thus, for a PUF sensor, cryptographic processes and sensing are inseparable. Further, we rely on a dominant external condition-voltage-responsible for unreliability to secure sensing. We validate the feasibility of the proposed universal PUF sensor approach based on experimental data extracted from RO-PUFs (Ring Oscillator PUFs).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4338-5; POD:978-1-5090-4339-2","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917639","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917639","PUF sensor;hardware security;physical unclonable function;secure sensing","Cryptography;Frequency division multiplexing;Hardware;Internet of Things;Sensors;Transducers","Internet;Internet of Things;computerised instrumentation;cryptography;oscillators;reliability;security;sensors;transducers","Internet of Things;PUF sensor;RO;alternative secure sensing approach;critical infrastructure monitoring;cryptographic mechanism;hardware protection logic;healthcare;physical measurement security;physical unclonable function;power consumption;resource-restricted IoT device;ring oscillator;transducer","","1","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing.

IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework.

However, being reachable through the Internet, cloud is not efficient enough for latency sensitive multimedia services and other time-sensitive services, like emergency and healthcare. Fog, an extended cloud lying within the proximity of underlying nodes, can mitigate the issues traditional cloud cannot solve being standalone. Fog can provide quick response to the requiring applications. Moreover, it can preprocess and filter data according to the requirements. Trimmed data is then sent to the cloud for further analysis and enhanced service provisioning. However, how much better is it to have a fog in any particular scenario instead of a standalone cloud working without fog is a question right now. In this paper, we provide an answer by analyzing both cloud-only and cloud-fog scenarios in the context of processing delay and power consumption according to increasing number of users, on the basis of varying server load.

One promising solution, on-chip error correction coding (ECC), has gained traction among memory companies [1] and is now required by the LPDDR4 standard for the first time [2]. In this paper, a 2Gb LPDDR4 that dissipates 75% less refresh current than a conventional LPDDR4 is presented. The proposed LPDDR4 exploits ECC to reduce refresh current, periodically activated voltage regulators to reduce standby power, and dual CA buffers to save the buffer current during low frequency operation. In addition, circuit designs for cell screen of DRAM with on-chip ECC, and for high-speed wafer test for known good die (KGD) - essential for small form factor devices using system-in-package (SiP) - are presented.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3758-2; POD:978-1-5090-3759-9","10.1109/ISSCC.2017.7870426","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7870426","","Clocks;Computer architecture;Error correction codes;Maintenance engineering;Microprocessors;Random access memory;Regulators","DRAM chips;Internet of Things;buffer circuits;error correction codes;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;low-power electronics;power consumption;system-in-package;voltage regulators","Internet of Things;IoT applications;KGD;LPDDR4 SDRAM;SiP;bit rate 4.8 Gbit/s;buffer current;circuit designs;dual CA buffers;high-speed DRAM;high-speed wafer test;known good die;low frequency operation;low-frequency operation;low-power dissipation;on-chip ECC;on-chip error correction coding;power consumption;refresh current reduction;reliability;self-refresh current;small form factor devices;standby power reduction;system-in-package;voltage regulators","","","","","","","","5-9 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers","A. Alaiad; L. Zhou","Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan","IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","20170302","2017","60","1","4","23","Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-qu- lity expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2632822","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828160","Internet of things;smart home healthcare systems;usability;wireless-sensor network","Collaboration;Context modeling;Medical services;Predictive models;Smart homes;Technological innovation;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;health care;home computing;patient care;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Kvale approach;WSN-SHHS application;WSN-SHHS research;WSN-based smart home healthcare system;generic technology adoption model;home healthcare agency;home healthcare patient;human detachment;life-quality expectancy;patient-centered care;patients adoption;pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model;predictive power accounting;smart telecommunication technology;technology adoption theory;wireless sensor network","","1","","","","","20170120","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques.

Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications.

Magnetic Induction (MI) based communication is known in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT), near-field communication (NFC), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in challenging environments. In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate. In this work, we analyze the potential of the distributed beamforming based MI-BASNs.

In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application.

The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for time-sensitive healthcare applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early notification of emergency situations to support smart decision making. While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications. In this work, we present dynamic Fog, a high level programming model for time-sensitive applications that are geospatially distributed, large-scale, and latency-sensitive. We also analyze our fog model with healthcare data, more specifically with Heartrate data that is one of the most time-sensitive medical data which deals with life and death situations.

This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4470-2; POD:978-1-5090-4471-9","10.1109/WI.2016.0054","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817071","Bayesian inference;Nominal matrix factorization;probabilistic hierarchical model;routine pattern discovery","Bayes methods;Manganese;Matrix decomposition;Probabilistic logic;Robustness;Smart homes;Sparse matrices","Bayes methods;Internet of Things;behavioural sciences;data mining;health care;home automation;intelligent sensors;intelligent structures;matrix decomposition;mobile computing;pattern clustering;vectors","Bayesian lasso;Bayesian nominal matrix factorization;Internet of Things;IoT;activity pattern mining;basis vector reconstruction accuracy;basis vectors;daily activity routine analysis;data-driven paradigm;health care;hierarchical probabilistic model;human behavioral analysis;human interpretation;nominal data matrix decomposition;ordinal matrix factorization;senior adult well-being;sensor data collection;smart home;smart sensor technologies","","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively.

However, a majority of IoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of memory and computational ability, so that they cannot provide heavy security protocols and authentication. To protect connections over constrained networks, we introduce a back-end offload architecture which offloads the processing of a security protocol to a specified back-end offloader. The offloader assists constrained devices back-end by handling the packets of handshake procedure and encrypted application data. The load balancing of offloaders and the protection of offload messages are also provided in the design. The proposed architecture allows an extremely constrained device to establish a secure session by utilizing high-level authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate, without the burden of deploying heavy security modules.

It is the network that consist physical objects embedded with software, sensors, electronics. It provides connectivity that is used to enable things to exchange data with the manufacturer and other operator device which is based on the international global standards. It creates the capability to compute, conclude and understand environmental measure, from elegant ecologies. We can create IoT by distributing the work of devices in the communicating network. Using this approach we can get the way to combine actuators and sensing devices in a smooth way and common operating picture (COP) are developed by sharing information over the platforms. In this paper we show the vision, provocation, possible usage scenarios and the steps to build the Internet of Things. IP stacks and web servers technological developments are used for smart every day objects. This paper describes how IOT can be implemented in the realistic way to invoke the vision. The contents which we can use in IOT can come into picture from a big area of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders, electric clams in coastal water automobiles with the help of built in sensors among them. If we want to develop a fully integrated future internet then IOT is steeped out by enable and using the technologies which is based on wireless such as RFID tokens and attached from nodes of actuator and sensing devices.

Body area networks are quickly becoming increasingly important in the world of healthcare with wide application in the treatment and monitoring of chronic patients using on-body devices. Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys. We show that these measurements results in derived keys that are unpredictable and exhibit significant difference with previous keys. This is an improvement over existing schemes where keys vary for different hosts but tend to be similar over time.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0873-5; POD:978-1-5090-0874-2; USB:978-1-5090-0872-8","10.1109/ISIE.2016.7745050","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745050","Authentication;Internet-of-Things;Key Derivation;Physiology;Security;User-Centric","Biomedical monitoring;Body area networks;Cryptography;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Monitoring","Internet of Things;ad hoc networks;body area networks;body sensor networks;cryptography;electrocardiography;health care;motion measurement;patient monitoring;patient treatment;telecommunication security;telemedicine","BAN;ECG;Internet-of-Things;ad-hoc connections;body area sensor network;chronic patient monitoring;chronic patient treatment;device communication;electrocardiograms;emergency situation;healthcare;host movement;motion sensors;on-body devices;patient complication detection;physical access;physiological signals;response time;secure communication;security parameter negotiation;shared key derivation;wearable security","","","","","","","","8-10 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication.

Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP.

This paper explores and applies the Internet of Things paradigm in the ALFs context. In particular, we present the design, the implementation, and the experimental evaluation of a system capable of supporting the daily activities of healthcare assistants that operate in ALFs for people with physical or cognitive disabilities. The solution combines wearable and mobile technologies to improve assistance requests and anomaly detection. With this healthcare support system, caregivers can be automatically alerted of potentially hazardous situations that happen to the inhabitants while these are out of sight. Furthermore, inhabitants can require assistance instantly and from any point of the facility. We evaluated the system in two ways. We performed a functional test with two professional caregivers, and we deployed the system in an ALF in Italy for 36 hours, collecting the opinions of the involved caregivers and inhabitants.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8845-0; POD:978-1-4673-8846-7","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.29","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552034","Ambient Assisted Living;Disabilities;Healthcare support system;Internet of Things;Wearable devices","Assisted living;Biomedical monitoring;Guidelines;Hospitals;Internet of things;Monitoring","Internet of Things;assisted living;handicapped aids;mobile computing","ALFs;Internet of Things;IoT solution;ambient assisted living;anomaly detection;assisted living facilities;cognitive disabilities;healthcare support system;mobile technology;physical disabilities;time 36 hour;wearable devices","","1","","","","","","10-14 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms. Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems.

Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable.

Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen.

In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics.

This security service is still in its infancy when devices are deployed in unattended environments. We propose a new authentication mechanism based on the state of the art protocol μTESLA, that aims to reduce the delay of forged packets in the receivers buffer, by efficiently computing the key disclosure delay.

This means that a lot of data will be generated and the management of this data is going to be a big challenge. To transform IoT into reality and build upon realistic and more useful services, better resource management is required at the perception layer. In this regard, Fog computing plays a very vital role. With the advent of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) and remote healthcare and monitoring, quick response time and latency minimization are required. However, the receiving nodes have a very fluctuating behavior in resource consumption especially if they are mobile. Fog, a localized cloud placed close to the underlying IoTs, provides the means to cater such issues by analyzing the behavior of the nodes and estimating resources accordingly. Similarly, Service Level Agreement (SLA) management and meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements also become issues. In this paper, we devise a methodology, referred to as MEdia FOg Resource Estimation (MeFoRE), to provide resource estimation on the basis of service give-up ratio, also called Relinquish Rate (RR), and enhance QoS on the basis of previous Quality of Experience (QoE) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) records.

Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay.

We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2016.2533321","Swiss National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444198","Internet of Things;semantic technologies;service composition;smart factory;smart home;web of things","Context;Internet of things;Manufacturing;Mashups;Protocols;Semantics;Visualization","Internet of Things;inference mechanisms;meta data;ubiquitous computing;visual programming","Internet of Things;application program interfaces;embedded semantic API descriptions;goal-driven configuration;process-driven approach;reasoning;semantic metadata;service composition system;service mashups;smart environment;smart homes;ubiquitous computing;visual modeling tool","","4","","33","","","20160330","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Duty Cycle Challenges of IEEE 802.11ah Networks in M2M and IoT Applications","M. Qutab-ud-din; A. Hazmi; L. F. Del Carpio; A. Goekceoglu; B. Badihi; P. Amin; A. Larmo; M.

This IoT/M2M connectivity technology is deployed at the sub-1 GHz ISM bands, that are subject to various coexistence regulations set by the authorities. In Europe, devices in the Sub-1 GHz ISM bands must comply with the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%, provided that they also support Listen Before Talk (LBT) and Adaptive Frequency Agility (AFA) features. In this article we investigate the challenges of such duty cycle limitation and its effect on the IEEE 802.11ah network performance from the uplink transmission perspective, considering typical use cases characterized by different traffic models. We first derive the theoretical maximum duty cycles of both an individual station and an individual AP assuming full-buffer or saturated traffic. Then, with emphasis on more practical uses cases, such as home/building automation and healthcare, where the traffic of an individual station or node is strongly unsaturated, we analyze the IEEE 802.11ah network performance without and with the 2.8% maximum duty cycle limitation. The obtained results show IEEE 802.11ah networks can provide efficient support for the most important use cases such as sensor networking, home automation and healthcare, despite the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%. This shows that IEEE 802.11ah is one of the most prominent and scalable IoT/M2M connectivity technology, that can enable different types of IoT applications, even in the presence of the tight coexistence requirements at the ISM band.","","Paper:978-3-8007-4221-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7499282","","","","","","","","","","","","18-20 May 2016","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet.

To deliver a comprehensive view on the computational power of modern wearable devices (smart phones, watches, and embedded devices), we perform an evaluation of a variety of them utilizing bilinear pairing for real-time communication. In order to deliver a complete picture, the obtained bilinear pairing results are complemented with performance figures for classical cryptography (such as block ciphers, digital signatures, and hash functions).

Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time responses. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data has to be uploaded to the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, the cloud on the edge of the network, known as Fog or Micro Datacenter (MDC), plays an important role. Fog resides between the underlying Internet of Things (IoTs) and the mega datacenter cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. To achieve this, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we propose in this paper. Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can stop using resources at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management through Fog computing, we take into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. With the intent of showing practical implications of our method, we implemented it on Crawdad real trace and Amazon EC2 pricing.

Many organizations in the globe have surveys and announces emerging or disruptive technologies every year. Of course, they have developed their own processes to achieve the goal, but the insights of experts from related domains are usually absolute. In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results. We named this approach as Chi(Computer Human Interacting)-Delphi method for technology foresight. As Web goes to connect machine intelligences in the era of Internet of Things, the collaboration between human intelligence and machine intelligence will be eventually the next great wave for predicting the future.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8139-0; POD:978-1-4673-8140-6","10.1109/KST.2016.7440470","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440470","","Cognition;Collaboration;Floods;Internet;Machine intelligence;Organizations;Text mining","Internet;artificial intelligence;data mining;forecasting theory;groupware;health care;human computer interaction;inference mechanisms;security of data","Chi-Delphi method;InSciTe;Internet security;KISA;KISTI;KRIBB;NIPA;collaboration;complex event processing;computer human interacting;data gathering;data-intensive analysis;disruptive technologies;healthcare;human expert;identity resolution;intelligent service platform;machine intelligence;prescriptive analytics modules;reasoning;science and technology;text mining","","","","","","","","3-6 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested by analyzing healthcare data sets, mainly comprises of activities including walking, running, ECG. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core™i5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. The results show that the proposed architecture efficiently analyze the massive volume of data with a maximum throughput.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6314-0; POD:978-1-4799-6315-7","10.1109/ICSensT.2015.7438483","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7438483","IoT;architecture;efficiency;healthcare;throughput","Accelerometers;Decision making;Servers;Social network services;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","Big Data;Internet of Things;electrocardiography;gait analysis;health care","Big data;ECG;Hadoop single node setup;Internet of Things;UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core i5 machine;computational efficiency;dynamic data;healthcare data sets;running;walking","","3","","25","","","","8-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the healthcare research, the number of elderly people is rapidly growing and they need more support in their life. Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been established as a best communication paradigm for future internet, particularly in IoT. Based on hierarchically structured names, ICN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and provides an efficient and intelligent communication paradigm for both IoT and AAL (IoT-AAL) technologies.

IoTs are power and bandwidth-constrained with applications in smarthome, healthcare, transportation and industrial domains. Routing bears significant importance in IoTs where sensors acting as hosts deliver data to the gateways which in turn impacts power consumption. Thus there exists a need for modeling and analysis of routing in IoT networks towards predicting power consumption. In this work, we develop an analytical model of a naive flooding based routing protocol using Markov chains. In particular, we derive steady state transition probabilities of transmit and receive states using protocol execution traces and further utilize them towards predicting power consumption. Our approach to modeling is generic in that it can be applied to routing protocols across domains. Evaluation of the model shows that the predicted values for power consumption lie closer to the actual observations obtained using ns-2 simulation thus resulting in minimal mean square errors.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7309-8; POD:978-1-4673-7310-4","10.1109/CoCoNet.2015.7411258","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7411258","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Power demand;Routing;Routing protocols","Internet of Things;Markov processes;mean square error methods;routing protocols","Internet of Things;IoT networks;Markov chains;decision making capabilty;flooding-based routing protocol;healthcare;industrial domain;minimal mean square errors;ns-2 simulation;power consumption;protocol execution trace;real-time communication;receive state;routing analysis;routing modeling;smarthome;steady state transition probability;transmit state;transportation","","1","","33","","","","16-19 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected- pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that. Then will briefly talk about supervised and unsupervised learning and the use of three supervised approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Random Forests (RF); and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving radar signal classification and source identification problem. Results from applying the NN, RF and SVM (using R and Matlab) on complete data subset (without missing data) and the full dataset with substituted (up to 60%) missing data with MI, KNN-I and BTl will be critically analysed and discussed. Finally, I'll talk about the opportunities and challenges in applying computational intelligence and machine learning techniques to Big Data and the available software for Big Data.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9606-6; POD:978-1-4673-9607-3","10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407137","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7407137","","Transportation","Big Data;data analysis;neural nets;radar computing;radar signal processing;random processes;signal classification;unsupervised learning","BTl;Big Data;KNN-I;MI method;Matlab;RF;SVM;bagged tree imputation;computational intelligence;data analytics;k-nearest neighbour imputation;machine learning models;modem model-based approaches;multiple imputation method;neural networks;radar signal classification;radar signal large dataset preprocessing;radar signal source identification problem;random forests;supervised approaches;support vector machines;unsupervised learning","","","","6","","","","20-22 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an example surveillance or smart mobility applications adopt multiple photo and video cameras working at different spectral range (visible, near infrared, far infrared) and covering different fields of view, or they exploit arrays of radio/light detection and ranging (Radar/Lidar) sensors to detect the presence of targets, of their speeds, distance and direction. Even the access of distributed nodes in IoT towards a centralized cloud storage/processing center requires high data rate connections. Since low size and low weight of the nodes are needed, IoT can benefit from the high communication data rate, several Gbps, that can be provided by fully integrated mm-wave wireless transceivers. The wavelength at such frequency is few mm and hence the whole transceiver including the antenna can be integrated in a single chip. To this aim, this paper presents the design of 60 GHz transceiver key blocks (Low Noise Amplifier, Power Amplifier, Antenna) to ensure connection distances up to 10 m and data rate of several Gbps. Around 60 GHz worldwide there are freely-available (unlicensed) several GHz of bandwidth. By using a CMOS SOI technology RF, analog and digital baseband circuitry can be integrated in the same chip minimizing noise coupling. Even the antenna is integrated on chip reducing cost and size vs. classic off-chip antenna solutions. The proposed transceiver allows for the implementation of low cost nodes for IoT systems with data rates of several Gbps and with a 10 m link distance. These specifications are suitable for home/office scenarios, or for body area networks (healthcare, wellness) or for applications on board vehicles (cars, trains, ships, airplanes).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0366-2; POD:978-1-5090-0367-9; USB:978-1-5090-0365-5","10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389043","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389043","High-speed network;IoT (Internet of Things);Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);mm-wave integrated transceiver","Antennas;CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Gain;Noise figure;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","CMOS integrated circuits;Internet of Things;body area networks;body sensor networks;millimetre wave amplifiers;millimetre wave antennas;mobility management (mobile radio);optical radar;radio transceivers;sensor arrays;silicon-on-insulator","CMOS SOI technology RF;Internet-of-things;IoT systems;analog baseband circuitry;centralized cloud processing center;centralized cloud storage center;digital baseband circuitry;frequency 60 GHz;high bandwidth connections;high communication data rate;high speed sensing nodes;light detection-and-ranging sensor array;millimetre-wave integrated wireless transceivers;noise coupling minimization;radio detection-and-ranging sensor array;smart mobility applications;wireless sensor networks","","","","21","","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the histories of existing mobile communication markets may show applications that are different from the ones written in the above articles and new business schemes that are different from existing ones. In this article, I analyze the dominant non-voice applications of the existing mobile communication systems including paging services and identify the primary factors that made them dominant. I also analyze the business models of the network carriers. This analysis leads me to forecast that the next-generation of dominant mobile communication applications will be developed on the basis of a balance between the freedom of participants and suspicion, and the business models will become more liberal.

Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device. This article discusses the background, advantages, and design details of the architecture proposed, which is achieved by an open-ended question and a potential solution. It opens a new research direction of HealthIoT and smart homes.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2015.7368826","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368826","","Data collection;Intelligent sensors;Logic gates;Robot sensing systems;Software defined radio;Wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","15","","","","December 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A long-term collection of these health data will benefit to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration. But most wearable devices and mobile apps in the market focus on personal fitness plan and lack of compatibility and extensibility to each other. Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation. Also, the demand on high security increases difficulties of designing reliable platform for integrating and managing multi-resource life-logging health data. This paper investigates the possibility of collecting and aggregating life-logging data with the use of wearable devices, mobile apps and social media. It compares existing personal health data collection solutions and identifies essential needs of designing a life-logging data aggregator in the IoT environments. An integrated data collection solution with high secure standard is proposed and deployed on a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare platform: MHA [15] by integrating five life-logging resources: Fitbit, Moves, Facbook, Twitter, etc. The preliminary experiment demonstrates that it successfully record, store and reuse the unified and structured personal health information in a long term, including activities, location, exercise, sleep, food, heat rate and mood.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.342","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363388","interdisciplinary;internet of things;life-logging data;wearable computing","Biomedical monitoring;Data collection;Facebook;Media;Medical services;Mobile communication;Twitter","Internet of Things;data aggregation;data integration;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;social networking (online)","Facbook;Fitbit;Internet of Things;IoT environments;Moves;Twitter;heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation;interdisciplinary healthcare collaboration;interdisciplinary healthcare research;life-logging personal health data;long-term health data collection;mobile apps;multiresource life-logging health data integration;multiresource life-logging health data management;personal health data collection solutions;social media;wearable devices","","6","","29","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment.

Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8321-9; POD:978-1-4673-8077-5","10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7331376","Approximate Computing;Biomedical Healthcare;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT;Wearable Devices","Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Encoding;Histograms;Medical services;Monitoring","biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring","Huffman table;battery-operated wearable devices;biosignal compressor;compression technique;energy supply;hardware resources;ultralow-power design;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable device energy consumption;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;wireless communication","","2","","32","","","","4-9 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host. Within the proposed ETT, both the mobility model, as well as the detection thresholds are calculated solely based on sensory data, making the whole system both scalable and robust to dynamic changes.

Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing - in some cases, even eliminating - their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems).","","Electronic:978-1-4503-2975-0; POD:978-1-5090-0384-6","10.1145/2627369.2631644","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298286","Energy Harvesting;Internet of Things;Low Power;Perpetual Systems;Power Management;Wearable Computing","Batteries;Nonvolatile memory;Power demand;Random access memory;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;embedded systems;energy harvesting;power aware computing","Internet of Things;IoT devices;QUBE wireless embedded platform;batteries;environmental energy harvesting;intelligent system-level power management techniques;nonvolatile memory technologies;societal-scale problems;ultralow power hardware platforms;wireless connectivity","","19","","61","","","","11-13 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional sectors such as transportation, medical and avionics, are witnessing fundamental changes in the supply chain and in the content where the interactions between the physical world and the computing world are becoming increasingly tight. Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS. Indeed, low power consumption is an essential requirement for the swarm of devices especially in the domain of wearable devices for healthcare. Coupled with low cost and reliability, power consumption has to be taken into consideration for any CPS deployment.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-8008-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-8009-6; POD:978-1-4673-8010-2","10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273478","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273478","","","","","","1","","","","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity.

From the viewpoint of application development, ontology sharing is the most important to integrate services. This paper, the first step towards ontology sharing, defines the iKaaS data model as one that integrates data models used in all applications in the project. The data defined in the iKaaS data model is converted into RDF format and stored in the RDF database. The reasoning mechanism in semantic web allows the semantic integration of data and applications.

This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people.

This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats.

In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7272-5; POD:978-1-4673-7273-2","10.1109/ICWS.2015.56","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7195591","IoT data management;Web service;content-based subscription;scalability","Engines;Filtering;Servers;Temperature sensors;Throughput;Tunneling magnetoresistance","Internet of Things;Web services;application program interfaces;content-based retrieval;middleware;optimisation","COSS;Internet-Of-Things;IoT service;NP-hard problem;REST API;TMR model;Web service;balanced rule engine partitioning;content-based subscription service;content-based subscription system;environment monitoring;healthcare;message distribution;middleware;supply chain tracing;tenant-message-rule model;traffic monitoring;vehicle networks","","1","","20","","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Healthcare of things (HoT) would enhance healthcare using the insight provided by sensor data. Healthcare users will subscribe to HoT services that use sensors to get activity data (such as steps walked, hours slept and so on) along with other health vitals (such as heart rate, temperature and weight) to improve user's health. Similarly Smart home users subscribe to a Smart home cloud service that will use data from home sensors. Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers.

The wireless system is constructed on top of 6LoWPAN energy efficient communication infrastructure to maximize the operation time. Fault tolerance is achieved via backup routing between nodes and advanced service mechanisms to maintain connectivity in case of failing connections between system nodes. The presented fault tolerance approach covers many fault situations such as malfunction of sink node hardware and traffic bottleneck at a node due to a high receiving data rate. A method for extending the number of medical sensing nodes at a single gateway is presented. A complete system architecture providing a quantity of features from bio-signal acquisition such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Electromyography (EMG) to the representation of graphical waveforms of these gathered bio-signals for remote real-time monitoring is proposed.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6117-7; POD:978-1-4799-6118-4; USB:978-1-4799-6116-0","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133626","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133626","6LoWPAN;Fault Tolerance;Internet of Things;Remote Patient Monitoring;Scalability;Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);e-Health","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Logic gates;Medical services;Monitoring;System-on-chip;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;bioelectric phenomena;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;electromyography;fault tolerance;health care","6LoWPAN energy efficient communication infrastructure;Internet of Things based architecture;backup routing;bio-signal acquisition;electrocardiogram;electroencephalography;electromyography;fault tolerance;health monitoring;healthcare;medical sensing nodes;operation time;scalability;sink node hardware;traffic bottleneck;wireless system","","5","","20","","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GS1 EPCglobal has led the development of RFID standards from unique identifier, communication protocol to event repository. Recently, its scope starts to broaden with the new standard of EPC Information Service (EPCIS v1.1), while GS1 EPCglobal had focused on RFID middleware in the field of supply chain management (SCM). We believe that EPCIS can act as an event-based context repository for IoT. However, the challenges of scalability and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from a variety of sources. In this paper, we propose the novel open source platform complying with the EPCIS v1.1 specification called Oliot EPCIS, which can collect and share event data for a broad range of IoT applications. The main contribution of the paper is as follows. To resolve the challenges, we propose the scalable and flexible EPCIS architecture, the document-based model of EPCIS event and the new event called SensorEvent. We show that Oliot EPCIS generally outperforms two existing solutions through the comparative experiment. Also, with the healthcare case study, we show that Oliot EPCIS can capture and share sensor values requiring a very intensive data rate based on SensorEvent.","2374-0221;23740221","Electronic:978-1-4799-1937-6; POD:978-1-4799-1938-3; USB:978-1-4799-1936-9","10.1109/RFID.2015.7113075","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113075","EPCIS;EPCglobal Network;IoT;RFID;the Internet of Things","Context;Databases;Radiofrequency identification;Scalability;Standards;Subscriptions;XML","Internet of Things;information services;radiofrequency identification","EPC information service;EPCIS v1.1 specification;EPCglobal;Internet of Things;IoT;Oliot EPCIS;RFID middleware;SCM;SensorEvent;event-based context repository;radio frequency identification system;supply chain management","","4","","18","","","","15-17 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics.

In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5967-9; POD:978-1-4799-5968-6","10.1109/iThings.2014.16","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059641","artifical neural network;hypertension prediction;logistic regression","Analytical models;Artificial neural networks;Diseases;Hypertension;Logistics;Predictive models;Regression analysis","backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis","ANN;AUC;BP algorithm;BRFSS;Internet of Things;IoT technology;MLP neural network model;area under the receiver-operator curve;artificial neural network-based approach;back propagation;behavior risk factor surveillance system;binary logistic regression model;cardiovascular diseases;chronic disease prediction model;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;healthcare technology;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;multilayer perception neural network model;population aging;quality of life improvement","","2","","30","","","","1-3 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions.

Hence, the use of Internet Protocol (IP) into LoWPAN has broadened new research area known as 6LoWPAN. Nowadays, 6LoWPAN technology is swiftly gaining recognition for its extensive application, ranging from healthcare to environmental monitoring. One of the challenges in 6LoWPAN is the route break often occurs due to node mobility, node failure and channel impairments. There are types of routing protocol that have been proposed to reroute or provide alternative routing to overcome the route break problem. However, the network is burdened of load RREQ the whole network. In this paper, we proposed LABC mechanism in the Local Route Repair using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm in 6LoWPAN network to enhance the routing against route breakage.

Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will involve symbiotic networks of people (social networks), smart devices, and smart phones or mobile personal computing and communication devices that will form net-centric societies or cyber-physical social systems. These devices - and the network - will be constantly sensing, monitoring, and interpreting the environment; this is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things (IOT). The symbiosis of IOT and social networks will have significant implications for both the market for advanced computing and communication infrastructure and the future markets - for nearly 4.5 billion people - that net-centric societies will create.

With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.","","Electronic:978-1-63190-043-3; POD:978-1-4799-5328-8","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257621","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014600","30 day readmission;Cloud;Collaboration;Internet of things;M2M;Management;Policy;Predictive Analytics;Sensors;e-health","Context;Electronic mail;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Sensors;Wide area networks","Internet of Things;cloud computing;hospitals;medical computing;patient care;risk analysis","30 day readmission protection program;Internet of things;US healthcare affordable care act;care quality;compromised data;data availability;data unavailability;e-health architecture;healthcare outcomes;hospitals;loT enabled cloud based e-health;post discharge;post discharge care;proactive care;readmission avoidance efforts;reduced payment penalties;risk patterns","","0","","12","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This often requires combining physical (i.e., IoT) data with social data created by humans on the Web and increasingly on their mobile phones (i.e., citizen sensing) as well as other data such as structured open data and background knowledge available on the Web (i.e., cyber data and knowledge). In this paper, we explore how integration and analysis of multimodal physical-cybersocial data can support advanced applications and enrich human experience. Specifically, we illustrate the complementary role played by sensor and social data, often intermediated by other Web based data and knowledge, using real-world examples in the domain of situational awareness, traffic monitoring, and healthcare.

IoT is evolving our knowledge and conception of the world. IoT aims to offer a common communication paradigm for all objects via the Internet and its protocols. For that reasons, it is being applied in all areas of life, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, military, cities management, and industry. One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN.

One of the key components for IoT based mobile healthcare is an accurate, low-cost, and user-friendly physiological monitoring device. In this study, such an intelligent, unobtrusive conformable, user friendly physiological monitoring device is presented. In particular, the inkjet printing of silver nano-particle ink, NPS-JL from Harima Chemicals, is used to fabricate interconnections and a 2.4 GHz antenna on low-cost stretchable plastics. Interconnections between RF SoC and passive components are made with isotropic conductive adhesive. Finally, the platform is demonstrated as a `plaster' like sensor node that measures the ECG signal and transmits that in real-time to a mobile device using Bluetooth low-energy protocol. Up to 14 m reading distance was demonstrated using the printed antenna in a close vicinity of the body.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4026-4; POD:978-1-4799-4025-7","10.1109/ESTC.2014.6962739","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6962739","","Biomedical monitoring;Biosensors;Consumer electronics;Monitoring;Substrates;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;UHF antennas;UHF detectors;UHF integrated circuits;biomedical electronics;biomedical telemetry;conductive adhesives;electrocardiography;health care;ink jet printing;integrated circuit interconnections;nanoparticles;patient monitoring;physiology;plastics;protocols;radiotelemetry;silver alloys;system-on-chip;telemedicine","Ag;Bluetooth low-energy protocol;ECG signal meausurement;ICT;Internet-of-Things;IoT based mobile healthcare;RF SoC technology;antenna;cloud computing;frequency 2.4 GHz;home services;inkjet integration;inkjet printing;intelligent physiological monitoring device;isotropic conductive adhesive;low-cost stretchable plastics;mobile device;passive components;plaster like sensor node;printed antenna;remote healthcare services;silver nanoparticle ink;unobtrusive conformable physiological monitoring device;user-friendly physiological monitoring device;wireless physiological monitoring system fabrication","","4","","19","","","","16-18 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Snow","","IBM Journal of Research and Development","20141121","2014","58","5/6","15:1","15:11","In this paper, we propose a commerce-related architecture, the Smarter Commerce Customer Engagement Architecture (SCCEA). This architecture involves a new definition of the commerce lifecycle and an alternative metric for calculating customer experience and benefit, called customer lifetime benefit (CLB). Traditionally, commerce-related architectures have enabled the direct involvement and interaction between customers and companies from a purchasing, customer support center, or marketing perspective. These systems typically help measure financial success through the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric. SCCEA represents a shift in approaches from these architectures to one focused on the interactions with the products customers own and on how those products are operating. SCCEA analyzes the data gathered directly from the operations of products to make a determination of what actions can be taken to positively influence customer experience. SCCEA is realized through combining three foundational domains: Smarter Commerce™, Internet of Things, and Customer Engagement. The paper begins with a definition of the commerce lifecycle, followed by an overview of the three foundational domains. With this foundation established, the authors describe the SCCEA architecture, subsystems, and functional components. Finally, to help clarify the feasibility of the SCCEA approach, a representative scenario from the healthcare industry is presented.","0018-8646;00188646","","10.1147/JRD.2014.2346593","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6964873","","Consumer behavior;Consumer products;Customer services;Electronic commerce;Internet of things;Investments;Market research;Network architecture","","","","0","","","","","","Sept.-Nov. 2014","","IBM","IBM Journals & Magazines"

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2363986","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949053","Cyber–physical social networks;Cyber???physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion","Algorithm design and analysis;Behavioral science;Complex networks;Context modeling;Design methodology;Global Positioning System;Internet;Internet of things;Market research;Media;Medical services;Public policy;Social factors;Social network services","Internet of Things;mobile computing;social networking (online);social sciences computing","Internet of Things;big data;cyber world;data-driven analysis;interpersonal trust;online network;physical network;smartphone;social persuasion","","4","","34","","","20141106","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research.

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved.

It seems that the surge in the volume of data generated by huge number of Smart Items can only be matched if a large percentage of mobile users start sharing the computation capability of their personal devices and work together towards true Participatory Computing in the IoT systems. In this work we try to understand the challenges associated with running computation jobs on the mobile devices using different types of workload often observed in IoT applications. Based on the insights gained from experiments performed by us, we propose a scheme where mobile phones, residential gateways and other edge devices offer free slots to servers in a cloud based data analytics system. Based on the free time slots offered by the mobile phones, if commensurately sized computational jobs can be scheduled, the unpredictability associated with using mobile phones as grid resources can be solved.","1521-9097;15219097","Electronic:978-1-4799-2081-5; POD:978-1-4799-2082-2; USB:978-1-4799-2080-8","10.1109/ICPADS.2013.101","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6808238","analytics;cyber-physical;internet of things;iot;mobile grid;prediction;ubiquitous systems","Availability;Internet;Mobile communication;Sensors;Servers;Smart phones","Internet of Things;cloud computing;data mining;embedded systems;mobile computing;mobile handsets","Internet of things;IoT computation grids;RFID devices;actuators;buildings;business insights;cloud analytics platform;cloud based data mining platforms;edge devices;edge gateway;embedded computers;factories;grid resources;healthcare devices;home appliances;intelligent things;mobile phones;mobile users;participatory computing;personal mobile phones;residential gateways;sensor network;sensors;smart items;technology revolution;unstructured data;vehicles","","4","","32","","","","15-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing applications are domain-specific and use their own descriptions of devices and measurements. A major challenge is to combine M2M data provided by these heterogeneous domains and by different projects. It is really a difficult task to understand the meaning of the M2M data to later reason about them.

These devices primarily collect data that is about or produced by people, be it street noise level of a neighbourhood, or the energy footprint of an individual's home or her location and other situational context. As this unprecedented amount of data is collected, we are challenged with one fundamental research question: who owns this data and who should have access to it? Specifically, the emergent of the Human Data Interaction (HDI) topic which aims to put the human at the centre of the data driven industry, calls attention to the IoT community to address the data ownership aspect more carefully. In this note, we offer a reflection on the challenges that IoT faces in regards to the data ownership in HDI and advocate the roles that both ordinary people and industries must play to best answer those challenges in shaping the IoT landscape.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803139","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803139","","Access control;Biological system modeling;Companies;Data models;Home appliances;Home automation;Internet","Internet of Things;human computer interaction;ubiquitous computing","HDI;Internet of Things;IoT community;data driven industry;data ownership;energy footprint;human data interaction;ownership aspect;personal healthcare;tailored smart city services;ubiquitous devices","","3","","14","","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.","0018-9294;00189294","Electronic:978-1-4799-4799-7; POD:978-1-4799-4798-0","10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783258","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6783258","","Clouds;Electrocardiography;Internet;Medical services;Real-time systems;Servers;Temperature sensors","3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;Internet of Things;electrocardiography;health care;patient monitoring;personal area networks;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","3G connectivity;3G-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;4G connectivity;ECG signals;Internet-of-Things functionality;UbuntuOne;WiFi-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;data logging;remote U-healthcare monitoring;sensor nodes;serial-line-Internet-protocol;temperature data;ubiquitous real-time monitoring","","8","","13","","","","17-20 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One probable commonality in each of these services will be the abundance of different types of data from different sources with the success of the systems depending on real-time or near real-time analysis of data. Such analyses are normally performed via well-known algorithms with a time-constraint on the execution, thus creating a requirement for parallel execution techniques. Some of these analyses may have a higher frequency of execution on a relatively small set of data, in which case the current big-data frameworks may actually add an overhead. Further, the frameworks like Hadoop demand the algorithms to be mapped onto a particular paradigm, which may not always be a suitable option. This paper, which is a work-in-progress, provides an experience report on the use of Condor, a well known Grid framework, for data-parallel “black-box” style execution of analysis algorithms in the context of Internet of Things. We concentrate on algorithms which are already in use, and can be partitioned into data-parallel subtasks without any modification and use Condor, which has traditionally been used for high-performance or high-throughput computing, as the execution framework.","2160-4886;21604886","Electronic:978-1-4799-0428-0; POD:978-1-4799-0426-6; USB:978-1-4799-0427-3","10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673380","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6673380","analytics;black-box;cyber-physical;mobile data mining;mobile grid;parallel execution;ubiquitous systems","","Internet of Things;data analysis;data mining;grid computing;mobile computing;parallel processing","Condor;Internet of Things;IoT context;big-data frameworks;cyber-physical systems;data parallel analytics;data-parallel black-box style execution;data-parallel subtasks;execution framework;grid framework;high-performance computing;high-throughput computing;mobile data mining;near real-time data analysis;parallel execution techniques;real-time data analysis;sensor-based intelligent systems;ubiquitous systems","","3","","28","","","","7-9 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5616-9; POD:978-1-4673-5615-2","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548958","6LoWPAN;IEEE802.15.4;U-Healthcare;WBAN;WSN","Accelerometers;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Protocols;Real-time systems;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;health care;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing","IEEE802.15.4;Internet of Things;Labview program;TCP client;TCP/IP;Zigbee;bluetooth;communication platform;edge router;gateway application;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;interoperability problem;next generation u-healthcare system;real-time healthcare monitoring;real-time monitoring;remote PC;smart devices;u-healthcare systems;ubiquitous healthcare","","9","","15","","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented.

In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality.

Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework.","","Electronic:978-953-290-026-2; POD:978-1-4577-1439-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064380","","Automation;Buildings;Internet;Protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","IP networks;Internet;personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN-IPv6;IP-based sensor networks;Internet of things;IoT;WSN;actuator technology;all-IP infrastructure;building automation;environment monitoring;smart metering;wireless sensor network evolution","","12","","24","","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL.

The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.","2331-9852;23319852","Electronic:978-1-4244-5176-0; POD:978-1-4244-5175-3","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421661","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421661","","Aging;Communications technology;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Environmental management;Information security;Internet;Medical services;Radiofrequency identification;Senior citizens","Internet;cryptography;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;mobile computing;patient care;protocols;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN network;ICT;Internet of things;MIPv6 protocol;NFC technology;RFID technology;authentication;clinical process;context awareness;cryptographic SIM card;disable people;elderly people;healthcare;information and communication technologies;mobility;patient life;secure communications;sensor networks","","8","","20","","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities","","","2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","20171023","2017","","","xi","xiv","In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such valida- ions span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of D<sup>n</sup>y for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems.

Equipped with pervasive technologies such as RFID and ‘smart dust’ in addition to sensors, actuators and machine-to-machine devices, IoT has the potential to offer innovative solutions to global challenges faced by ageing populations, climate change, growing cost of healthcare as well as how we manage our environment and natural resources. The heterogeneous nature of the IoT as well as the computational constraints of many of the building blocks of the IoT make security, privacy and trust a challenging problem to solve on the one hand, while security, privacy and trust play a critical role for most if not all applications of IoT in domains such as surveillance, healthcare, security, transport, food safety, manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements.

"Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities","A. Sheth","Wright State Univ., Dayton, OH, USA","2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","20150108","2014","","","2","3","Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain an- the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5666-1; POD:978-1-4799-5667-8","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004204","","","Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","Big Data;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity;Big Data volume;continuous semantics;domain models;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;metadata;ontologies;personalized digital health;semantic interoperability;semantic perception;smart data;vocabularies","","1","","","","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are entering the second golden period for computational intelligence development, because effective and efficient solutions to many of today's grand challenges in e-healthcare, smart cities, internet-of-things, Big Data, etc., require better, faster and cheaper computational intelligence algorithms, methods and techniques. These new challenges pose new research questions that can stimulate the rapid growth of our research field. There are huge opportunities for all of us to contribute to developing novel computational intelligence solutions to these challenges. Why not share your ideas and experiences in tackling difficult real-world problems with the wider communities and submit your work to one of the CIS journals? Authors who had a paper recently presented at WCCI'14 might be interested in taking the feedback they got at the Congress, extending the work further and submitting an extended paper to a CIS journal. They are here encouraged to let the world know of any novel ideas and contributions.","1556-603X;1556603X","","10.1109/MCI.2014.2326093","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853473","","","","","","0","","","","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The growth of the Internet shows no signs of slowing down and it steadily becomes the cause of a new pervasive paradigm in computing and communications. This new paradigm enhances the traditional Internet into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) created around intelligent interconnections of diverse objects in the physical world, such as vehicles, cell phones, habitats, and habitat occupants. It utilizes low-cost information gathering and dissemination devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, that facilitate fast-paced interactions among the objects themselves as well as the objects and persons in any place and at any time. IoT will usher in a wide range of smart applications and services to cope with many of the challenges individuals and organizations face in their everyday lives. For example, remote healthcare monitoring systems could aid in managing costs and alleviating the shortage of healthcare personnel; intelligent transportation systems could aid in reducing traffic congestion and inevitably the ills caused by it such as air pollution; smart distribution systems from utility grids to supply chains could aid in improving the quality and reducing the cost of their respective goods and services; tagged objects could result in more systematic recycling and effective waste disposal, and so on.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069706","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6069706","","Computer applications;Internet;Mobile communication;Special issues and sections","","","","27","","","","","","November 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multi-channel EEG signals as well as a designed sparsifying basis to increase the sparsity of the EEG signal to improve the reconstruction quality, hence, increase the efficiency of the system.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5007-9; POD:978-1-5090-5008-6","10.1109/ICUWB.2017.8251001","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251001","EEG;Internet of things (IoT);compressive sensing (CS);joint sparsity","Brain modeling;Compressed sensing;Electroencephalography;Image coding;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sensors;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1104-3; POD:978-1-5386-1105-0; USB:978-1-5386-1103-6","10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249087","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8249087","Application;Applied engineering;Consumer electronics;Healthcare electronics;Intel Edison;Internet of Things;Mechatronics;Medical electronics;Patient care;SMS;Traumatic Brain Injury;Wireless computing","Acceleration;Brain injuries;Force;Head;Resistors;Sensors","","","","","","","","","","19-21 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe.

In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants’ activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcaremonitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes. Our proposed methodology models activities based on spatially recognized actions, with every activity expected to have a direct relationship with a specific set of locations. Furthermore, the proposed technique validates the assignment of labels based on the temporal relations among consecutive actions. We performed experiments to evaluate our proposed methodology on CASAS datasets, which indicated that the proposed methodology achieved better performance, to a statistically significant extent, than state-of-the-art methodologies presented in the literature.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779158","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125664","Data Mining;In Home Activities;IoT;Mobile Healthcare;Mobile Multimedia;Wireless Sensors","Biomedical monitoring;Hidden Markov models;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Multimedia communication;Training","","","","","","","","","20171204","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'.

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all.

Six main design goals guided the design of Alzimio, including periodic safety checks, refined user control, flexibility and efficiency of alarms, and optimized operation, among others. Providing reliable continuous sensing and operation without drastically affecting battery lifetime provided a challenge. Such challenge is not unique to Alzimio, but is general to most IoT healthcare devices. Novel activity-recognition and geofencing algorithms are designed and optimized to meet the goals and overcome the challenge. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. Alzimio is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65, to achieve best accuracy and delay.

This increased population demands improved medical facilities only to realize there are not adequate doctors on role leading to deaths of nearly 1M Indians every year & approximately 700M deprived of even preliminary health treatment thereby carrying 21% of the global disease burden. In general, doctors are either not willing to serve the rural areas or they are not available 24×7 that is causing rural population to travel to cities even for casual ailments. According to WHO (World Health Organization) reports, India have less than 0.7 doctor /1000 population which is lower as compared to ratio of 4.3 in Russian federation, 3.8 in Argentina, 2.4 in USA & WHO Benchmark. Indian government spends just around 30% of the total budget in healthcare which is a penny in comparison to the USA & the UK. This increased population demands lower operational cost with high accuracy, early detection followed by prevention. In this paper, a futuristic approach is proposed to support the existing healthcare system by designing a preliminary multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair with E-diagnostic feature within a medical booth, analogous to an ATM booth.

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence. This paper presents the results of applying models to real clinical data. Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14).

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.","1089-7798;10897798","","10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010262","Cloud computing;Internet of Things (IoT);blindness;privacy;wireless body area networks (WBANs)","Body area networks;Cloud computing;Delays;Hospitals;Servers;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","20170814","Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Personalized wearable systems for real-time ECG classification and healthcare interoperability: Real-time ECG classification and FHIR interoperability","A. Walinjkar; J.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to - ake appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4815-1; POD:978-1-5090-4816-8; USB:978-1-5090-4814-4","10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101902","Arrhythmia Neural-Net;Arrhythmia classification;Arrhythmia detection;ECG FHIR;ECG signal processing;GP Connect;HAPI FHIR;HL7;Healthcare monitoring;MITDB Physionet;SNOMED-CT FHIR;Wearable IoT","Adaptive filters;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Real-time systems","adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising","3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG classification;ECG event observations;ECG kits biopotential measurements;ECG monitoring;ECG waveforms;FHIR interoperability;MIT-BIH Physionet;MITDB arrhythmia database;SNOMED coding system;Savitzky-Golay filter;arrhythmia classification;electronic health records database;feature extraction method;healthcare interoperability;heart rate variability analysis;kNN classifiers;machine learning models;neural net fitting models;personalized health-care monitoring devices;personalized wearable systems;recursive least square adaptive filter;signal processing;wearable biomedical devices;wearable health monitoring devices","","","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It causes deterioration in health leading to multi-organ failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user’s infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user’s mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090542","Chikungunya;Cloud Computing;Decision Tree;Fog Computing;Temporal Network Analysis (TNA).","Cloud computing;Decision trees;Monitoring;Pain;Real-time systems;Sensors","","","","","","","","","20171031","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets. Some considerations about major measurement challenges that the CPS self-awareness feature - oses in maintenance and troubleshooting operations are then drawn.

This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration.

Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4912-7; POD:978-1-5090-4913-4","10.1109/ICoICT.2017.8074640","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074640","Digital;Healthcare;IoT;Logic fuzzy;Monitoring;Thermometer","Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Monitoring;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Testing","Internet of Things;biomedical telemetry;fuzzy logic;health care;pacemakers;patient monitoring;telemetry;thermometers","HI;HI-Thermo;Hi-Thermo;Information Communication Technology;Remote Digital Blood Pressure;Telemetry Digital Pacemaker;WIFI digital thermometer;adaptive system;data transmission;digital systems;energy consumption;energy efficient IoT;energy issues;existing traditional monitoring;fever body temperature monitoring;fever monitoring;fuzzy logic;health services;monitoring fever body temperature","","","","","","","","17-19 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) and latest developments or improvements in E-health, pointed towards the fifth generation (5G) paradigm of health care application and services. This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data. Further, we propose a protocol stack for 5G-CCN WBAN to provide a secure, efficient and reliable E-health application services to meet the required needs of the current IP protocol stack and IoT devices.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1698-7; POD:978-1-5386-1699-4","10.1109/ICIOTA.2017.8073614","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8073614","Caching;Content-Centric Network;Healthcare;Internet-of-things;Wireless body area network","5G mobile communication;Body area networks;IP networks;Medical services;Servers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","5G mobile communication;IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;body area networks;health care;transport protocols","5G-CCN WBAN;CCN router;Content-Centric networking based framework;E-health care application record databases;IP network;IP protocol stack;IoT devices;fifth generation network;fifth generation paradigm;unified communication framework;wireless body area network;wireless medical sensor prototype","","","","","","","","19-20 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The project aims at: (1) Providing patients and healthcare facilities with a concise, clear and communicative interpretation of data from heterogeneous sources such as anamnestic, anthropometric, clinical and instrumental data (in particular, data obtainable from wearable sensors and so-called personal health systems). For this purpose, we plan to set up an infrastructure with high computational capabilities that is able to process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify new associations (Data Mining) between variables that can enrich communication and generate new knowledge. (2) Promoting a patient empowerment approach aimed at making the patient fully aware of the significance of a specific piece of information and the implications that it entails for the patient's state of health and wellbeing. To this end, we applied the principles of persuasive computing technology, i.e. technologies developed in order to influence and possibly modify habits and lifestyle choices through persuasion and awareness. (3) Implementing effective strategies to maintain health and a healthy lifestyle, as well as to provide integrated and optimized management of acute and chronic pathologies with an economic and social benefit for both individuals and the healthcare system.

These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption.

In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity.

Various aspects of modern cities are being automated and integrated with information and communication technologies to achieve higher functionality, optimized resources utilization, and management, and improved quality of life for the residents. Smart cities rely heavily on utilizing various software, hardware, and communication technologies to improve the operations in areas, such as healthcare, transportation, energy, education, logistics, and many others, while reducing costs and resources consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT provides a platform for linking the cyber parts of a smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city, including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals, and other resources. Another useful technology is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable localized and real-time support for operating-enhanced smart city services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing is not an easy task. This paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing. We propose an SOM called SmartCityWare for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog Computing. SmartCityWare abstracts services and components involved in smart city applications as services accessible through the service-oriented model. This enhances integration and allows for flexible inclusion and utilization of the various services needed in a smart city application. In addition, we discuss the implementation and experimental issues of SmartCityWare and demonstrate its use through examples of smart city applications.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731382","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990214","Cloud of Things;Internet of Things;Smart city;cloud computing;cyber physical systems;fog computing;middleware;service-oriented middleware","Cloud computing;Edge computing;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Smart cities","cloud computing;middleware;smart cities;town and country planning","Cloud of Things;CoT;Fog Computing;SOM approach;SmartCityWare;cloud computing paradigm;communication technologies;operating-enhanced smart city services;optimized resource utilization;service-oriented middleware","","","","","","OAPA","20170724","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1999-5; POD:978-1-5386-2000-7; USB:978-1-5386-1998-8","10.1109/AIMS.2017.11","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8027264","Analytics;Healthcare;IoT;Monitoring;Optimization;Text Mining;Wearable Technologies","Biomedical monitoring;Diseases;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Wearable sensors","Internet of Things;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;medical computing;recommender systems;text analysis","Internet of Things;IoT world;eventual diseases;health attributes;machine learning classification model;mathematical optimization model;optimal wearable devices;personalized advised wearables;proactive health monitoring;recommendation engine;recommendation system;structured demographic attributes;text mining;unstructured medical history;wearable technological devices","","","","","","","","25-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support integrated healthcare services in elderly homecare can make an important contribution to reducing such costs. The SOCIALIZE AAL project aims to create a new reference platform for the elderly by applying technological solutions to simplify their daily activities and the means by which they access dedicated services in order to improve their quality of life. This paper describes the Elderly Monitoring service - an IoT module of the SOCIALIZE platform, whose aim is to collect environmental and physical user data so that they can be supervised by medical and caregiver staffs. The system has been designed to enable easy addition and/or substitution of new services and devices within the environment.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4722-2; POD:978-1-5090-4723-9; USB:978-1-5090-4721-5","10.1109/CHASE.2017.66","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010621","","Data privacy;Databases;Encryption;Medical services;Servers;Speech recognition","Internet of Things;cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition","background sound;caregiver queries;disabled people;elderly;encrypted voice data;healthcare systems;homomorphic encryption;in-home IoT devices;in-home healthcare applications;mHealth data;mood;patients;privacy-preserving voice-based search;smart personal assistants;speech recognition;tone;voice content;voice data privacy;voice feature similarity;voice recording;voice upload;voice-enabled feature","","","","","","","","17-19 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4117-6; POD:978-1-5090-4118-3; USB:978-1-5090-4116-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7952278","Data-driven compressive sensing;Internet of things (IoT);mobile healthcare;wearable sensing","Biomedical monitoring;Dictionaries;Physiology;Sensors;Sparse matrices;Training;Wireless communication","compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction","ECG signals;compression ratio;cotraining approach;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;isometry property;long-term health monitoring;personalized features;physiologic signals;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;sensing matrix;signal characteristics;signal sparsity","","","","","","","","5-9 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams.

This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546","Direcci¿n General de Investigaci¿n, Innovaci¿n y Postgrado of Federico Santa Mar¿a Technical University- Chile, in the Project Private and Secure Mobile Cloud Framework for Medical IoT Devices (UTFSM-DGIP 116.23.3); 10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea Funded by the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805329","Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy","Cloud computing;Data models;Data privacy;Internet of things;Logic gates;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Privacy","cloud computing;health care;middleware","Internet of Healthcare Things;IoHT devices;OECD privacy principles;accountability act;automated compliance;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;cloud-based healthcare services;concealment process;distributed data collection protocol;fog based middleware;health data;health insurance portability;healthcare Web services;healthcare data;healthcare delivery;healthcare provider;healthcare things;holistic privacy middleware;hospital setting;intensive privacy preserving processes;living organism;personal gateways;personal health information;personalized health insights;privacy laws;privacy regulation frameworks;sensitive health information","","2","","","","OAPA","","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline.

The layered access structures are integrated into a single access structure, and then, the hierarchical files are encrypted with the integrated access structure. The ciphertext components related to attributes could be shared by the files. Therefore, both ciphertext storage and time cost of encryption are saved. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be secure under the standard assumption. Experimental simulation shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient in terms of encryption and decryption.

In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists.

In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.33","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917061","Cloud;Elasticity;Hospitals;Performance","Cloud computing;Databases;Elasticity;Hospitals;Radiofrequency identification","Web services;biomedical equipment;client-server systems;cloud computing;decision making;health care;medical information systems;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;virtual machines","EMH model;RFID;centralized management control center;client-server Web service;cloud elasticity facility;distributed framework;elastic multihospital management model;health equipments;medical treatment;motion detection;multihospital environments;multiple healthcare institutions;object elastic management;physical space elastic management;radio-frequency identification sensor tracking technology;real-time decision making;virtual machines","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5256-1; POD:978-1-5090-5257-8; USB:978-1-5090-5255-4","10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917942","Authorization;IOT;Json Web Token;OAuth 2.0","Authentication;Authorization;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Real-time systems;Servers","Internet;Internet of Things;application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;open systems;real-time systems","IoT cloud scenario;JSON Web token;OAuth 2.0;authorization framework;automatic monthly payments;bank account;interoperable API;phishing attack;real time clinical care;secure health care services","","","","","","","","14-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the system of them should be operated by using limited capacity of power because of very small size of battery that can be loaded into a wearable device due to the device properties. For such a reason, Chip Vendors are recently launching MCUs with ultra-low power capability on the market and also MCU that supports 7-step low power mode was appeared at present[1-3]. But now, it is very rare case to completely use Low Power Mode offered by MCU vendor on the operating system (OS) that is applied to wearable devices, and there is no case to support low power mode by the OS at the board level. Therefore, this paper suggests optimal supporting mechanism for ultra-low power multi-step mode at the OS level of wearable device. The mechanism proposed in this paper is largely divided into two parts. First, it is Low Power Mode Governor (LPMG) which is a module used to select an optimal low power mode after computation of retention time in idle mode. Second, we proposed Power-Off Mode, which disconnects power to the board when idle mode lasts for a long time. When integrating these two technologies and applying them to the Tickless nanoQplus[4], the OS for wearable devices developed at our lab, in the same Wearable Application Scenario 2 test, power consumption after passing a certain duration of time is reduced by 98.05% compared to idle mode, and 96.33% compared to sleep mode.

Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data.

Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type.

Internet of Things (IoT) allows caring of people from remote locations with the help of integration of wireless sensor network with internet. Different sensors are used to measure different health parameters. Processing of smart health care data in an efficient manner is necessary. Slight time variation causes severe effect such as loss of life. In IoT, delay occur in processing large volume of sensor data in real time. Energy spent by the sensors also affected by processing delay. Because sensors spent energy in idle state. To reduce delay in processing smart health care data, Multi core technology is included with IoT. SixLoWPAN is the technique used to connect low configured devices with internet. In this paper, Task Level Parallelism (TLP) is applied to process different health parameters in parallel. TLP utilizes the available resources in optimal way. It makes our system as more efficient. The proposed system improves performance upto 65.5%. Efficient system also reduces power consumption of the devices.

The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure. Using the model, diseases are ranked according to the current symptoms and stored in the server. Information of diseases and appropriate treatment therapies is sent back to the patient as well as stored in a web portal for personal monitoring.","","","10.1109/NICS.2016.7725627","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7725627","","","Internet of Things;bioinformatics;diseases;health care;patient monitoring;patient treatment;pattern clustering;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","ESP8266 sensors;IVSM;Internet-of-Thing technology;IoT device;IoT technology;LM35 sensors;disease diagnosis;health informatics;heart beat;heart failure;hypothermia;intelligent system;intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system;intuitionistic fuzzy set;intuitionistic fuzzy vector;intuitionistic vector similarity measure;knowledge model;multicriteria IFRS;network connection;personal healthcare monitoring;physical conditions;pulse sensor;single-criterion IFRS;tachycardia;temperature measurement;viral fever","","","","","","","","14-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591351","","Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Monitoring;Parallel processing;Program processors;Sensors","Internet of Things;cardiology;diseases;health care;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes","Internet-of-hearts;data analytics;disease pattern recognition;global network;large-scale dynamic network;map reduce;mobile health system;mobile technology;multiple processors;network optimization;parallel computing;sensing technology;smart connected healthcare;stochastic gradient descent approach","","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

M2M standards provided by ETSI/oneM2M are essential for a paradigm shift, aiming at making the IoT truly interoperable without the need for human intervention. In this work, we map two applications that rely on the role of a smartphone as a gateway, which acts as a proxy to connect legacy devices to the IoT using a standard middleware. We illustrate the advantages of using M2M, and, as a proof-of-concept, we measure and quantify the energy savings obtained, showing improvements of smartphones' battery life.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1990-8; POD:978-1-5090-1991-5","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500481","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500481","Battery life;Internet of Things (IoT);Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications;crowdsensing;efficiency;healthcare;mobile gateways;smart cities","Internet of things;Logic gates;Medical services;Monitoring;Smart phones;Standards;Urban areas","Internet of Things;smart cities;smart phones","Internet of Things;M2M gateways;energy savings;machine-to-machine middleware;smart cities IoT applications;smartphones","","4","","21","","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For these systems, designing an efficient MAC protocol that is able to meet the challenges on network quality such as throughput, latency, data reliability and energy saving is an imperative task. This paper presents a polymorphic, multi-behavioral MAC protocol called PEAM (Polymorphic, Energy-Aware MAC Protocol) designed to support WBANs used in ubiquitous healthcare monitoring systems. The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states. PEAM was designed based on cross-layer constructs that allow across the layers synchronization and coordination orchestrated by the application layer and targeting the Data link layer services. PEAM has also been enabled to interplay with IPv6 networks through interaction with the 6LowPAN middleware. This protocol was evaluated and compared to the well-known IEEE 802.15.4 standard using the network simulator OMNET++, and exhibited clear superiority.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1990-8; POD:978-1-5090-1991-5","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500491","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500491","Cross-layer design;Energy efficiency;Internet of Things;MAC Protocol;Polymorphic protocols;WBAN","Biomedical monitoring;Body area networks;Media Access Protocol;Medical services;Sensors;Wireless communication","IP networks;Zigbee;access protocols;body area networks;health care;middleware;synchronisation;telecommunication power management","6LowPAN middleware;IEEE 802.15.4 standard;IPv6 network;PEAM;WBAN;care delivery;data link layer service;layer coordination;layers synchronization;network quality;network simulator OMNET++;polymorphic energy aware MAC protocol;polymorphic multibehavioral MAC protocol;remote healthcare monitoring;ubiquitous healthcare monitoring system","","","","9","","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario. Finally, we conducted a scalability analysis to determine the feasibility of deploying IReHMo in large numbers in regions of north Sweden.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8325-7; POD:978-1-4673-8326-4","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454565","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454565","Internet of Things;eHealth;remote health monitoring;sensor communication;smart city;smart region","Bandwidth;Encryption;Logic gates;Monitoring;Protocols;Senior citizens","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;data communication;geriatrics;patient monitoring","CoAP;HTTP;IReHMo;IoT-based remote health monitoring system;MQTT;ageing population;bandwidth requirements;data generation;healthcare data;home stay;network communication protocols;network requirements;north Sweden;scalability analysis;single sensor event;smart regions","","1","","22","","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The platform also connects the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patients' health data. Vital health parameters are measured using simple, non-restricting electrical sensors. The platform has outlier detection capabilities and is designed to send alerts to patients and their respective doctors in case any anomaly occurs.

Wireless sensor networks have facilitated our life using the remote sensing ability. However, these systems could be taken advantage by the malicious parties to mislead users since they are often not physically secured and are used in hostile environments. We have proposed theoretical and statistical framework for creating data integrity attacks and corresponding security defenses. The data integrity attack is defined as a type of attack that targets to mislead the system by altering some collected data of the system in such a way that to achieve the goal of attackers. We use the Intel lab sensor data and demonstrate that it is easy to attack only a few essential sensors values to change the behavior of system, such as the control of air conditioner. To be more specific, by changing the temperature and humidity data measured by a group of sensors, the attacker can control the air conditioner turning on and off without being detected by correlation check. On the top of data integrity attacks, we have further developed low overhead defense schemes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0366-2; POD:978-1-5090-0367-9; USB:978-1-5090-0365-5","10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389143","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389143","","Correlation;Humidity;Robot sensing systems;Security;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Intel lab sensor data;data integrity attacks;low overhead defense schemes;remote sensing ability;security defenses;wireless sensor networks","","1","","16","","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives.

Selecting the optimal route for data transmission is one of the vital factors from the perspective view point of a routing protocol In order to eliminate the redundancy of data and to enhance the QoS parameters, Statistical Ad-hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (S-AODV) routing protocol is proposed in this paper.

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7910-6; POD:978-1-4673-7911-3; USB:978-1-4673-7909-0","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380509","Android App;Android Smartphones;Mean Shift Algorithm;Patients with diabetes;RGB color evaluation","Algorithm design and analysis;Diabetes;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Smart phones;Wounds","cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones","Android App;Android smartphone;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;caregivers;chronic ulcer image analysis;diabetic patient;diabetic ulcers;flexible wound assessment system;healing status;high-resolution digital camera;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;skin color;visual examination;wound assessment;wound image analysis system;wound size","","1","","9","","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC.

This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult. In this paper we provide a solution to model the security concepts in BPMN by extending it with new designed security elements, which can be integrated with the BPMN diagram smoothly.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.346","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363392","BPMN;Healthcare;Internet of Things;Security Requirement","Authentication;Authorization;Business;Medical services;Standards","business data processing;data integrity;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;security of data","BPMN diagram;BPMN security extensions;EHR data management;EHR data storage;IoT technology;business process model and notation;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;digital information;electronic health record;health care process modelling;information privacy;information security;system vulnerability","","","","9","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2417684","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070665","6LoWPAN;Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP);RFID;WSN;healthcare;hybrid networks;radio frequency identification (RFID);representational state transfer (REST);smart environment;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Computer architecture;Hospitals;Monitoring;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Web services;biomedical telemetry;health care;medical control systems;medical information systems;patient monitoring;personal area networks;radiofrequency identification;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT-aware architecture;REST web service;UHF RFID functionalities;automatic patient monitoring;automatic patient tracking;biomedical devices;constrained application protocol;control center;local users;low-power wireless personal area network infrastructure;patient physiological parameters;radiofrequency identification;remote users;representational state transfer network infrastructure;smart healthcare systems;smart hospital system;smart mobile technologies;ultralow-power hybrid sensing network;wireless sensor network","","60","","26","","","20150327","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The call button of patient is batteryless and wireless. The positioning system is developed for this batteryless button. When the switch is pressed, a wireless telegram is sent to reference nodes that act like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This wireless message contains the module ID and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value. The reference nodes or beacons forward the information gathered from target node to a central receiver attached to a computer. A program is developed to read the incoming signals to the receiver module for processing. This program calculate the distance between target node (unknown location) and each reference node (known location), and then it determines the position of the call button which held by the patient. In parallel, nurses hold smart phones, and the position is determined via WiFi-Based Positioning System (WPS). Both systems are combined and linked to the nurse calling system. Therefore, when a patient hits the batteryless button, the system will compare the patient position with nurses' positions and notify the nearest nurse. The main goal of developing such system is to decrease the time taking for the nurse to provide healthcare for patients.","","Electronic:978-9-5329-0056-9; POD:978-1-5090-0053-1","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2015.7314058","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314058","Angle of Arrival (AoA);EnOcean Standard;Indoor Localization/Positioning;Internet of Things (IoT);Location Awareness;Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI);Time of Arrival (ToA);Trilateration;WiFi-Based Positioning System (WPS)","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Mobile handsets;Receivers;Switches;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","indoor navigation;smart phones;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","RSSI;WPS;WSN;WiFi indoor positioning system;WiFi-based positioning system;batteryless button;batteryless radio;healthcare;hospital nurse calling systems;indoor localization system;received signal strength indicator;smart phones;wireless message;wireless sensor networks;wireless telegram","","1","","29","","","","16-18 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities.

However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI.

With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms.

Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit.

In a real time health monitoring system, there are many sensors connected to a local data processing unit through a shared channel having a fixed bandwidth. These sensors have a wide variety of channel access requirements. The access to the channel should be discrete, so that each and every sensor avails the required bandwidth and delay in the shared channel.

Nanotechnology is providing a new set of tools to design and manufacture miniaturized devices such as sensors or on/off chips networks. Such devices require wireless communications for information sharing and coordination. Unfortunately, reducing the size of a classical metallic antenna down to a few micrometres would impose the use of very high resonant frequencies, from the near infrared to the optical ranges (tens of hundreds of THz). This would drastically limit their communication range and require the implementation of transceivers able to operate at this extremely high frequency. Graphene offers a new approach to radically downscale antennas thanks to its ability to support the propagation of Surface-Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in the terahertz frequency band. Graphene micro-antennas provide a better integrability for future miniaturized wireless systems and represents an enabling technology for applications such as Wireless NanoSensor Networks, Internet of Things and On/Off-Chip Wireless Networks. In this talk we will describe the fundamental properties behind graphene miniaturized antennas as well as its applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5447-6; POD:978-1-4799-5448-3","10.1109/IMWS-BIO.2014.7032435","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032435","","Antennas;Graphene;Nanotechnology;Resonant frequency;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","graphene;microwave antennas;polaritons;surface plasmons;terahertz wave devices;transceivers;wireless sensor networks","C;SPP waves;classical metallic antenna;fundamental properties;graphene microantennas;graphene miniaturized antennas;graphene wireless communications;high resonant frequencies;infrared ranges;internet-of-things;miniaturized devices;miniaturized wireless;nanotechnology;on/off-chip wireless networks;optical ranges;radical downscale antennas;surface-plasmon polariton waves;terahertz frequency band;transceivers;wireless nanosensor networks;wireless systems","","0","","","","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning.

Wireless sensor networks are composed of a large number of sensor nodes with limited energy resources. There is a need to design protocols that adapt much better to the constraints of the sensor network environment. I propose a protocol called Large Scale Environmental Monitoring and Maintaining Sensing Coverage in Sensor Networks. When an event is expected to occur in an area, the application requires a minimum percentage of sensor coverage. Since the sensor nodes are deployed randomly in the sensing field, it may consist of sensor nodes with overlapping coverage areas providing redundant data. It would be desirable to save energy in some sensor nodes by allowing them to sleep, when sensor node is covered by the neighbors of sensor nodes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4357-9; POD:978-1-4799-4356-2","10.1109/FiCloud.2014.47","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984203","Clustering;Energy efficiency;Sensor networks","Base stations;Clustering algorithms;Energy dissipation;Energy efficiency;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;redundancy;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","data redundancy;education field;healthcare field;large scale environmental monitoring;limited energy resource;monitoring field;overlapping coverage;protocol design;retail field;science field;sensing coverage maintainance;wireless sensor network energy saving","","0","","14","","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica.

Addition of enormous number of M2M devices into the cellular networks poses a heavy competition to existing Human-to-Human (H2H) devices for getting radio resources, thereby affecting the performance of the H2H communications. But, one can not treat all M2M flows as low priority and schedule them after H2H flows, as there are many M2M applications like healthcare and tracking which are of high importance and delay-intolerant. Hence, there is a need for class based priority scheduling of the traffic of M2M and H2H sessions in the network. In this paper, we propose a class based dynamic priority scheduling algorithm for uplink transmission of M2M and H2H traffic in LTE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by various metrics such as H2H throughput and system throughput and also compared with existing schedulers.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803179","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803179","","Delays;Heuristic algorithms;Internet;Resource management;Scheduling algorithms;Throughput;Uplink","Long Term Evolution;cellular radio","H2H communications;LTE networks;M2M communications;M2M devices;cellular service providers;class based dynamic priority scheduling algorithm;human-to-human devices;machine-to-machine communication;uplink transmission","","13","","9","","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are widely used in several areas (e.g., healthcare, disaster management, and manufacturing). However, their provisioning still faces several challenges such as cost and resource usage efficiency. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that may aid in tackling these challenges. It has three main facets: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper focuses on the IaaS aspects of robotic applications as cloud computing services. It proposes an architecture that enables cost efficiency through virtualization and dynamic task delegation to robots, including robots that might belong to other clouds. Overlays and RESTful Web services are used as cornerstones. A prototype is built using LEGO Mindstorms NXT as the robotic platform, and JXTA as the overlay middleware. Related work is reviewed, the functional entities and interfaces of the architecture are described, and the prototype architecture is presented along with the implemented scenario.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803195","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803195","Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS);Robotic applications;cloud computing;task allocation;task delegation","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Engines;Logic gates;Robot sensing systems;Virtualization","Web services;cloud computing;control engineering computing;middleware;robots;ubiquitous computing","IaaS;JXTA;LEGO Mindstorms NXT;PaaS;RESTful Web services;SaaS;cloud computing services;cost efficiency;disaster management;dynamic task delegation;healthcare;infrastructure as a service;manufacturing;overlay middleware;platform as a service;resource usage efficiency;robotic platform;software as a service;ubiquitous robotic applications;virtualization","","5","","18","","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803112","Body Area Networks;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage","Decision support systems;Internet","body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks","bandwidth consumption;healthcare;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;power consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;statistical techniques;wireless human gait monitoring system","","0","","5","","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Our initial numerical results show a reduction of the handoff costs on the mobile router which normally constitute a bottleneck in such a system.

Then the active linked data with data, task, context, computational organization, knowledge, presentation and interaction models is defined by extending the conventional linked data.

In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose standby slots that are deployed during each beacon interval. The standby slots are able to identify unscheduled data with low delivery latency. An adaptive beacon is then provided that quickly reschedules the time slots. Furthermore, the AB-MAC asymmetrically assigns energy consumption to a hub instead of the sensor nodes when possible in order to reduce node's energy waste.

How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4580-6; POD:978-1-4577-1976-9","10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.90","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142189","healthcare;save live;smartphone","Diseases;Fluids;Global Positioning System;Home appliances;Sensors;Smart phones;Vehicles","Global Positioning System;alarm systems;biomedical communication;gyroscopes;health care;patient monitoring;radiocommunication;sensors;smart phones","GPS coordinates;GPS positions;ambulance;bodily position;calories;defibrillator;driver indisposition;fluid;gyroscope;hazard warning flasher;healthcare;jogging;life-saving information;measured data;momentary state of health;patient condition;pedals;portable sensors;pulse counter;smartphones;sphygmograph;standing;steering wheel;travelling;walking;wireless communication","","1","","12","","","","19-22 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The m-health is currently bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare delivery and technology sectors. From the wireless communications perspective, the current decade is expected to bring the introduction of new wireless standards and network systems with true mobile broadband and fast internet access healthcare services. These will be developed around what is currently called the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. In this editorial paper, we will introduce the new and novel concept of 4G health that represents the long-term evolution of m-health since the introduction of the concept in 2004. The special section also presents a snapshot of the recent advances in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the evolved m-health perspective. It will also present some of the concepts that can go beyond the traditional “m-health ecosystem” of the existing systems. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging healthcare delivery concept.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2183269","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134672","4G mobile technologies;Body area network (BAN);Internet of Things (IOT);WiMAX;e-health;long term evolution (LTE);m-health;medical sensors;personal area network (PAN);telemedicine","Long Term Evolution;Medical services;Mobile computing;Personal area networks;Special issues and sections;Telemedicine;WiMAX","","","","38","","14","","","20120118","Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1941-0; POD:978-1-5090-1942-7","10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457124","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457124","","","Internet of Things;body sensor networks;radio links;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things security;IoT security;M2M communication;data session;health infrastructure;link fingerprint matching;machine-2-machine communication;medical applications;symmetric spatiotemporal characteristics;wireless bodyworn sensing device security;wireless link;wireless sensor networking","","","","","","","","14-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
