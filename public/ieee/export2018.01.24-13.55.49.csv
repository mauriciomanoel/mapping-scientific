System analysis is given about: Big Data market in Health Care, ways of Medical Information Systems development, and the direction of hospitals transition to new condition based on three “whales” (hybrid Cloud computing, supercomputer and data center). The Internet of Things ecosystem foregrounds some important aspects related to gerontology, genetics, biorhythmology, and gravitational biology. Sociological understanding of people's role in formation of the new high IT dependence reality allows to determine the main vectors of farsighted forecast. The technological evolution can be described as subsequent stages: distribution of IT — automation — Digital transformation and Internet of Things — Big Data analytics — Artificial Intelligence solutions — people connection to Augmented Reality — Context-as-A-Service — NBIC- and GRAIN-technologies — Humanity Plus. The essence of concept “patient” is changing. Patient transforms into an e-patient (all records about patient have been digitized) and then into Internet-patient with monitoring of health parameters within the Internet of Things surrounding people. Getting Augmented Reality patient is becoming a Digital patient. Augmented Reality methods are already being developed to treat patients. Medicine as part of social structure becomes more diffuse, covering common space of Internet of Things. Medical culture acquires a new value for society.

It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3035-8; POD:978-1-5386-3036-5","10.1109/CBI.2017.34","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010750","Assisted Living;Dementia care;Internet of Things;Multicriteria evaluation;e-Health","Dementia;Industries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;analytic hierarchy process;diseases;health care","AHP;Internet of Things;IoT;analytic hierarchy process;chronic diseases;dementia care;health care services;multicriteria evaluation;special needs","","","","","","","","24-27 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Things represent the physical objects which are provided with unique identification numbers and their purpose is to collect and transmit the data which are relevant to the scenario in which things are placed. From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification. In RFID system, proper authentication has to be performed between RFID tags and RFID reader.

The proposed platform consists of a Pro-Trinket microcontroller, NRF transceiver module, Wi-Fi module, and Raspberry Pi. Two piezoelectric sensors are mounted on the structure to collect data continually. A proposed mathematical model is implemented on the Pro-Trinket to detect the health of the structure using the piezoelectric sensors output. If there is any damage, the Pro-Trinket will determine the damage location and size, and send this information to the Raspberry Pi using NRF transceiver. Raspberry Pi acts as a hub to collect the data from many such NRF transceivers located in different locations on the structure. The Raspberry Pi will upload the data to the cloud using a Wi-Fi module. The data will be stored in the cloud and can be checked remotely from any mobile device.

The challenge in this regard is to deliver energy to the RFID sensors that are embedded inside the structures in a manner that they can continuously sense for occurrence of any rare structural events. This paper summarizes some of the progress that has been made to-date in the area of self-powered RFID sensor networks within the concept of IoT. The core sensor uses a self-powering method which directly harvests computational and storage energy from slight strain-variations in the structure. The event signatures can then be stored on a non-volatile memory and remotely retrieved at a later period of time. In this “sense now retrieve later” paradigm, self-powering is only used for continuous sensing and data-logging of essential statistics; whereas, data retrieval and reconfiguration is achieved using a low-cost commercial RFID system. Another advantage of using a commercial RFID system for data retrieval is that the related standards and FCC compliance are well established and the technology can be easily integrated with other IoT network infrastructure.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5341-7; POD:978-1-4799-5342-4; USB:978-1-4799-5340-0","10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7538983","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7538983","Fatigue prediction;Internet-of-Things;NFC;RFID;infrastructural health monitoring;piezo-floating gate sensor;self-powered sensor","Logic gates;Mechanical sensors;Monitoring;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Strain","Internet of Things;condition monitoring;data loggers;energy harvesting;information retrieval;radiofrequency identification;structural engineering computing;wireless sensor networks","FCC compliance;IoT network infrastructure;civil infrastructure;computational energy harvesting;continuous sensing;data reconfiguration;data retrieval;data-logging;infrastructural health monitoring;low-cost commercial RFID system;nonvolatile memory;radio-frequency identification tagging technology;self-powered Internet-of-Things;self-powered RFID sensor networks;sense now retrieve later paradigm;storage energy harvesting;strain-variations","","1","","","","","","22-25 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this vision e-health applications are one of the most promising applications in IoT. However, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality constitutes the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme for an e-health application. This scheme allows both of sensors and the Base Station (BS) to authenticate each other in order to secure the collection of health-related data. Our scheme uses nonces and Keyed-Hash message authentication (HMAC) to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides authentication with less energy consumption, and it terminates with a session key agreement between each sensor and the Base Station. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that our scheme saves energy. In addition, it is resistant against different types of attacks.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8659-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8660-6; POD:978-1-4799-8661-3","10.1109/NGMAST.2015.31","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373224","Authentication;E-Health;Identity;Internet of Things;Session key agreement","Authentication;Base stations;Internet of things;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;authorisation;medical administrative data processing","HMAC;Internet of Things;IoT context;authentication exchange;base station;data collection security;e-health applications;electronic health;keyed-hash message authentication;lightweight authentication scheme;security analysis;session key agreement","","2","","24","","","","9-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is also the emergence of smart environments such as smart homes, cars, highways, cities, factories and grids. Presently, it is difficult to quickly forecast or prevent urgent health situations in real-time as health data are analyzed offline by a physician. Sensors are expected to be overloaded by demands of providing health data from IoT networks and smart environments. This paper proposes to resolve the problems by introducing an inference system so that life-threatening situations can be prevented in advance based on a short and long term health status prediction. This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud. The inference system can also resolve the problem of data overload in sensor nodes by reducing data volume and frequency to reduce workload in sensor nodes. This paper presents a novel idea of tracking down and predicting a personal health status as well as intelligent functionality of inference in sensor nodes to interface IoT networks.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9348-5; POD:978-1-4673-9349-2","10.1109/ATNAC.2015.7366781","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366781","Cloud;Health status;Inference;IoT;Life expectancy;big data;data mining;mHealth;mIoT","Big data;Intelligent sensors;Medical services;Sensor systems;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;cloud computing;data mining;health care;inference mechanisms;mobile radio","IoT networks;converged Internet of Things;data overload problem;inference system;long-term health status prediction;mHealth;mobile health perspective;personal health information;predictive data mining;sensor nodes;short-term health status prediction;smart cars;smart cities;smart factories;smart grids;smart highways;smart homes;smart wearable devices","","","","24","","","","18-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments.

This paper proposes an environmental effect removal based structural health monitoring scheme in an IoT environment. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to eliminate environment effects from sensor data which contain both real vibration feature of architectural structure and environmental interferences. After environmental effects removal, Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) which is a classical method for signal analysis is used for structural health analysis and monitoring. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy in structural health monitoring and robust performance against environmental interferences.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4974-3; POD:978-1-4673-6229-0","10.1109/IMIS.2013.91","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603725","Environmental Effect Removal;Internet of Things;Principal Component Analysis;Structural Health Monitoring","Covariance matrices;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Sensors;Vectors;Vibrations","Hilbert transforms;Internet of Things;condition monitoring;environmental factors;principal component analysis;sensors;signal processing;structural engineering computing","HHT;Hilbert-Huang transformation;Internet of things;IoT;PCA;SHM;environmental effect removal;environmental interferences;principal component analysis;sensors;signal analysis;structural health monitoring;variable environmental conditions","","5","","21","","","","3-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally.

However, MQTT-SN faces a new set of challenges for service guarantees when operated for a reliable or time-critical applications. The impact of various network parameters on the MQTT-SN service assurance requires an end-to-end system study, which are unexplored yet. In this paper we analyze in detail about the end-to-end service assurance parameters such as content delivery delay and probability of content delivery for a MQTT-SN to be used in health care Internet of Things (IoT). To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals.

The sensor nodes in these applications need to transmit information data to personal station and receive control information from personal station to adjust working modes. However, unlike easily rechargeable personal station, body sensor nodes suffer from energy shortage, which affects the nodes' lifetime. To solve this problem, we design a novel MAC layer protocol to enhance the energy efficiency and extend the lifetime of body sensor nodes in wireless body area networks in this letter. The proposed protocol utilizes a hybrid scheme by taking the advantages of carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance scheme and time division multiple access scheme. In addition, we allocate the main transmission overhead at the personal station side and design a novel awaiting order state for sensor nodes to improve the energy efficiency. Also, the analysis and simulation results demonstrate the proposed protocol can provide from 6% to 15% decrease on energy consumption than other protocols.","","","10.1109/LSENS.2018.2795566","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8264722","MAC protocol;Wireless body area networks;energy efficiency;sensor networks","Body area networks;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Sensors;Time division multiple access;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","20180122","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Communication Protocol for Enabling Continuous Monitoring of Elderly People through Near Field Communications","A. J. Jara; P. Lopez; D. Fernandez; M. A. Zamora; B. Ubeda; A. F. Skarmeta","","Interacting with Computers","20180118","2014","26","2","145","168","Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the us- rs and the system, are demonstrated.","0953-5438;09535438","","10.1093/iwc/iwt030","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155471","assistive technologies;novel interaction paradigms;systems and tools for interaction design;ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools;ubiquitous and mobile devices;usability testing","","","","","","","","","","","March 2014","","OUP","OUP Journals & Magazines"

In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs — and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation — are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed.

Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities.

When designing an IoT-system, often various technological alternatives are available (e.g. communication technologies, types of sensors). Although this choice set can be narrowed down by mapping the functional and technical requirements on the technical specifications of the technologies, chances are that even after this step multiple alternatives are still feasible. In this work, we describe an IoT-system design methodology that also takes into account strategic and economic considerations. As a result, the choice set of feasible technologies can be limited to feasible alternatives that are also the most economic and strategic choices.

Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner.

Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrow-band signals because of multipath propagation. In this work, we design a positioning system using narrow-band signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing Received Signal Strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software defined radio techniques. In the given experiment results, we find that the positioning system achieves a mean positioning accuracy of 1.61m, which represents a 36.1% improvement over traditional RSS-based fingerprinting.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794337","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8259458","Ensemble Learning;Indoor Positioning;Internet of Things;Software Defined Radio","Bandwidth;Distance measurement;Pattern matching;Signal processing algorithms;Software algorithms;Wireless fidelity;ZigBee","","","","","","","","","20180116","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Current networks must adapt to and cope with the specific requirements of IoT applications since resources can be requested on-demand simultaneously by multiple devices on different locations. One of these requirements is low latency, since even a small delay for an IoT application such as health monitoring or emergency service can drastically impact their performance. To deal with this limitation, the Fog computing paradigm has been introduced, placing cloud resources on the edges of the network to decrease the latency. However, deciding which edge cloud location and which physical hardware will be used to allocate a specific resource related to an IoT application is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the IoT application service placement problem is proposed, which considers multiple optimization objectives such as low latency and energy efficiency. Solutions for the resource provisioning of IoT applications within the scope of Antwerp's City of Things testbed have been obtained. The result of this work can serve as a benchmark in future research related to placement issues of IoT application services in Fog Computing environments since the model approach is generic and applies to a wide range of IoT use cases.","","Electronic:978-3-901882-98-2; POD:978-1-5386-2153-0","10.23919/CNSM.2017.8255974","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255974","Centralized management;Fog Computing;ILP;IoT;Orchestration","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Logic gates;Optimization;Smart cities;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","","26-30 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy, and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5019-2; POD:978-1-5090-5020-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254418","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254418","","Algorithm design and analysis;Big Data;Feature extraction;Intelligent sensors;Meteorology;Real-time systems","","","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A promising approach to address this need is the novel concept of network slicing, which aims at allocating portions of network resources to specific tenants, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), IoT, e-health, connected vehicles, etc. While this has been traditionally done with long-term agreements between network operators and tenants as MVNOs, in this work we focus on a new business model where network operators offer network slices as a service (SlaaS).

To date, extensive research been made in above-mentioned areas, which is frequently named Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Recently, the term of Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging, which emphasizes the interconnection of all available resources both physical and virtual with the purpose of collecting and exchanging data. Thus, IoT technologies have been widely adopted for the gathering of health related resources to provide reliable and effective healthcare services especially to elderly and people with chronic diseases.

Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system.

"Validity of Biosignal Processing System based on Haar Transform in IoT Application","Y. Shin; J. Lee; S. Kim","","2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","20180111","2017","","","206","211","In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1324-5; POD:978-1-5386-1325-2","10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251290","Haar transform;Haar wavelet;IoT;clustering;correlation;distance measure;healthcare;time series","Correlation;Euclidean distance;Market research;Medical services;Physiology;Time series analysis;Transforms","","","","","","","","","","23-25 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for power management in smart homes focuses on reducing electricity cost and avoiding the high peak demand problems. For reducing electricity cost, another source of power can be used. The most preferable primary power unit will be solar power due to its availability in nature. This paper prioritizes the operation of power units. The proposed system consists of a controller, a photovoltaic system with battery, smart electrical appliance and smart communication network. The main use of the controller is to schedule the power units which may be solar power, battery power and grid supply. The proposed system uses Battery Energy Storage and Management (BESM) algorithm, which helped to reduce electricity cost.

This paper considers using sparse representation and well-defined inequality indexes drawn from the theory of inequality to distinguish ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) from non-VEBs. Our approach involves designing a separate dictionary for each arrhythmia class using a set of labelled training QRS complexes. Sparse representation, based on the designed dictionaries of each new test QRS complex is then calculated. Following this, its class is predicted using the winner-takes-all principle by selecting the class with the highest inequality index. Our experiments showed promising results ranging between 80% and 100% for the detection of VEBs considering the patient-specific approach, 80% using cross-validation and 70% on unseen data using independent sets for training and testing respectively. An efficient hardware implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is also presented.

An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions.

The development in the field of Internet of Things has been enormous and the application of these solutions is scalable to high limits. The quantum of Internet of Things (IoT) is developing fast and is predicted to reach each and every sector of the computing world. We are already converging towards smart homes, smart highways, and smart cities. The defense sector of any nation is also affected by these developments. Defense field's solution is primarily based on sensors and their deployments. The primary aim of sensory data is the conclusion of information suitable for tactical decision and analysis in the Future battlefield environment. From capturing soldier's vital health parameters to its weapons, ammunition, location status, every data has a purposeful meaning and is of particular importance to the tactical commander sitting in the command center. We are proposing a novel mechanism to combine Internet of Things with the emerging graph database for better decision support system so as to create a situational awareness about every parameter of the soldiers in the battlefield.

Air pollution leads to adverse effects on Human health, climate and ecosystem. Air is getting polluted because of release of Toxic gases by industries, vehicular emissions and increased concentration of harmful gases and particulate matter in the atmosphere. Particulate matter is one of the most important parameter having the significant contribution to the increase in air pollution. This creates a need for measurement and analysis of real-time air quality monitoring so that appropriate decisions can be taken in a timely period. This paper presents a real-time standalone air quality monitoring system which includes various parameters: PM 2.5, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity and air pressure. Internet of Things is nowadays finding profound use in each and every sector, plays a key role in our air quality monitoring system too. Internet of Things converging with cloud computing offers a novel technique for better management of data coming from different sensors, collected and transmitted by low power, low cost ARM based minicomputer Raspberry pi. The system is tested in Delhi and the measurements are compared with the data provided by the local environment control authority and are presented in a tabular form.

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors. The readings are shown in the form of graphs at IBM Watson IoT platform.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6471-7; POD:978-1-5090-6472-4","10.1109/CCAA.2017.8230004","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8230004","Arduino UNO;Healthcare System;IBM Bluemix cloud service;Internet of Things;Raspberry pi;cloud computing","Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","","","","","","","","","","5-6 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1392-4; POD:978-1-5386-1393-1; USB:978-1-5386-1391-7","10.1109/HIC.2017.8227623","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227623","","Aging;Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Instruments;Monitoring;Sociology;Stability analysis","Internet of Things;assisted living;body sensor networks;cloud computing;gait analysis;handicapped aids;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sensor fusion","assistive device;assistive technologies;chronic disease;cloud storage;deployable gait monitoring;discrete gait monitoring;gait cycles;global healthcare system;health monitoring;hybrid sensorized canes;mobile device;mobility impairments;multisensor IoT;multisensor fusion algorithm;particular impairments;unobtrusive activity monitoring;walkers;wearable devices","","","","","","","","6-8 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe.

In this paper, we describe the development of a new course on wireless communications and networks that makes heavy use of IoT technologies. The paper describes in detail one new laboratory experiment involving an SDR board (BladeRF) sending messages to an RFM22 based receiver using a specific modulation scheme and data frame structure. The BladeRF board together with a laptop running GNU radio and GRC (GNU radio companion) act as the transmitter.

This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6704-6; POD:978-1-5090-6705-3; USB:978-1-5090-6703-9","10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210833","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210833","Cloud e-Healthcare;Software-Defined Networking;Wireless Body Area Network","Conferences;IEC;IEC Standards;Noise measurement","","","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT applications and services have given rise to a number of sub-fields in the IoT space. Wearable technology, with its particular set of characteristics and application domains, has formed a rapidly growing sub-field of IoT, viz., Wearable Internet of Things (WIoT). While numerous wearable devices are available in the market today, security and privacy are key factors for wide adoption of WIoT. Wearable devices are resource constrained by nature with limited storage, power, and computation. A Cloud-Enabled IoT (CEIoT) architecture, a dominant paradigm currently shaping the industry and suggested by many researchers, needs to be adopted for WIoT. In this paper, we develop an access control framework for cloud-enabled WIoT (CEWIoT) based on the Access Control Oriented (ACO) architecture recently developed for CEIoT in general. We first enhance the ACO architecture from the perspective of WIoT by adding an Object Abstraction Layer, and then develop our framework based on interactions between different layers of this enhanced ACO architecture. We present a general classification and taxonomy of IoT devices, along with brief introduction to various application domains of IoT and WIoT. We then present a remote health and fitness monitoring use case to illustrate different access control aspects of our framework and outline its possible enforcement in a commercial CEIoT platform, viz., AWS IoT.

Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system.

Due to the open wireless medium, secure routing functionality becomes important. However, the current solutions focus on a constrain set of network vulnerabilities and do not provide protection against newer attacks. In this paper, we propose SCOTRES—a trust-based system for secure routing in ad-hoc networks which advances the intelligence of network entities by applying five novel metrics. The energy metric considers the resource consumption of each node, imposing similar amount of collaboration, and increasing the lifetime of the network. The topology metric is aware of the nodes’ positions and enhances load-balancing. The channel-health metric provides tolerance in periodic malfunctioning due to bad channel conditions and protects the network against jamming attacks. The reputation metric evaluates the cooperation of each participant for a specific network operation, detecting specialized attacks, while the trust metric estimates the overall compliance, safeguarding against combinatorial attacks. Theoretic analysis validates the security properties of the system. Performance and effectiveness are evaluated in the network simulator 2, integrating SCOTRES with the DSR routing protocol. Similar schemes are implemented using the same platform in order to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, SCOTRES is deployed on two typical embedded system platforms and applied on real CPSs for monitoring environmental parameters of a rural application on olive groves. As is evident from the above evaluations, the system provides the highest level of protection while retaining efficiency for real application deployments.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752801","10.13039/501100000780 - European Commission in the context of the H2020 COSSIM Project; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038766","Cyber-physical system (CPS);Internet of Things (IoT);secure routing protocols;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Jamming;Measurement;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","20170915","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An early-warning system for slope collapse and debris flow is essential to ensure safety of human beings and assets. Based on fiber optic sensing technology and Internet of Things, a new sensing transducer for internal earth pressure measurement in a soil slope is proposed, fabricated, and tested in this paper. The working principles, theoretical analysis, laboratory calibrations, and discussions of the proposed pressure transducers are elaborated. Extensive evaluations of the resolutions, physical properties, and response to the applied pressures have been performed through modeling and experimentations. The results show that the sensitivity of the designed pressure sensor is 0.1287 kPa/με across a pressure range of 140 kPa. Finally, a field soil slope was instrumented with the developed fiber optic sensors and other sensors. Through internet and cloud computing platform, the stability of the soil slope was analyzed. In the cloud computing platform, the numerical simulation is carried out by considering the slope internal deformations, rainfall infiltration, and limit force equilibrium. The factor of safety of the soil slope was calculated, which could be used to determine health condition of the instrumented slope. The performance was evaluated and classified into three categories. It proves that the proposed early-warning system has potential to monitor the health condition of the soil slopes.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2771494","Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of China; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002822 - Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101469","Fiber optic sensor;Internet of Thing;cloud computing;early-warning system;slope","Cloud computing;Optical fiber sensors;Pressure sensors;Soil;Strain;Temperature sensors","distributed sensors;fibre optic sensors;geotechnical engineering;mechanical stability;pressure measurement;pressure sensors;pressure transducers;soil","cloud computing platform;early-warning system;fiber optic sensing technology;fiber optic sensors;field soil slope;instrumented slope;internal earth pressure measurement;pressure 140.0 kPa;pressure sensor;pressure transducers;quasidistributed fiber optic sensor networks;slope collapse;slope failure;slope internal deformations","","","","","","","20171109","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IoT systems are mainly comprised of embedded devices with limited computing capabilities while having a cloud component which processes the data and delivers it to the end-users. IoT devices access the user private data, thus requiring robust security solution which must address features like usability and scalability. In this paper we discuss about an IoT authentication service for smart-home devices using a smart-phone as security anchor, QR codes and attribute based cryptography (ABC). Regarding the fact that in an IoT ecosystem some of the IoT devices and the cloud components may be considered untrusted, we propose a privacy preserving attribute based access control protocol to handle the device authentication to the cloud service. For the smart-phone centric authentication to the cloud component, we employ the FIDO UAF protocol and we extend it, by adding an attributed based privacy preserving component.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6458-8; POD:978-1-5090-6459-5; Paper:978-1-5090-6457-1; USB:978-1-5090-6456-4","10.1109/ECAI.2017.8166453","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8166453","FIDO;IoT attributes based authentication;IoT authentication;IoT privacy-preserving;QR-based authentication;U-Prove","Authentication;Cloud computing;Home appliances;Mobile handsets;Privacy;Protocols","Internet of Things;authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;home automation;private key cryptography;smart phones","ABC;Internet of Things;IoT authentication service;IoT device access;QR codes;attribute based cryptography';attributed based privacy preserving component;cloud component;cloud service;device authentication;embedded devices;privacy preserving attribute based access control protocol;robust security solution;security anchor;smart-home devices;smart-phone based privacy-preserving security framework;smart-phone centric authentication;user private data","","","","","","","","June 29 2017-July 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT architectures contribute to critical aspects of our society like transportation, health-care, industry, telecommunications and many others. Security is difficult to be implemented in the IoT context because the embedded devices are resource constrained and deployed in uncontrolled areas, thus being targeted by various security attacks. In scenarios like smart city, IoT networks are populated by both trusted and untrusted transient devices, thus mechanisms for mitigating complex security attacks must be implemented. Embedded networks with near real-time constraints are subject to denial-of-service attacks which can easily affect the applications availability by injecting malicious packets into the network.

The early design of PHM systems requires system engineering methodology to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of systems. However, as the complexity grows, there may be some misunderstanding in specification that are not obvious and it is hard to perform verification and evaluation in a more intuitive way. In order to enhance the intuitiveness and reduce the misunderstanding in early development stage, we present a visual model-based framework to simulate and evaluate the cloud-based prognostics and health management systems. The framework proposes a three-abstraction-layer hierarchical architecture to represent distributed data sources and cloud-based PHM service center. The design of the framework is based on system modeling language and allows flexible algorithm implementations of function modules.

Certain environments are proposed that are smart and self aware by direct communication between devices of various types that are part of the IoT. One category of devices such as the Low Power Lossy networks (LLNs) consists of numerous small sensors and low power devices as building block elements in IoT. The ROLL working group at Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT) has designed the Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) which is the core of the IoT protocol stack used for communication between these low-power devices. To our knowledge experimentation and evaluation of RPL is very much needed and not much done so far. A few simulation tools exist which enable evaluation of RPL for a realistic deployment scenario. This paper focuses on understanding of the architecture and protocol stack of RPL and thereby its place in IoT. The performance of RPL is carried out for a Smart Health environment scenario by the simulations done in the Contiki OS Cooja simulator with respect to the performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, latency, signalling overhead and energy consumption. The simulation results reveal that the RPL has shown certain suitable characteristics which may make it useful for larger scale deployments.","","CD:978-1-4673-8853-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-8855-9; POD:978-1-4673-8856-6","10.1109/ICCCI.2017.8117763","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117763","Internet of Things;RPL Routing Protocol","Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Routing protocols;Sensors;Standards","Internet;Internet of Things;health care;routing protocols","Contiki OS Cooja simulator;IEFT;Internet engineering task force;IoT protocol stack;ROLL working group;RPL routing protocol;direct communication;knowledge experimentation;larger scale deployments;low power devices;low power lossy networks;low-power devices;routing protocol for LLN;smart health environment scenario","","","","","","","","5-7 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the m-Therapy framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers.

Such research-oriented residential monitoring systems (RRMSs) usually face two major challenges, long-term reliable operation management and validation of system functionality with minimal human effort. Targeting these two challenges, this paper describes a monitor of monitoring systems with ground-truth validation capabilities, M<sup>2</sup>G. It consists of two subsystems, the Monitor<sup>2</sup> system and the Ground-truth validation system. The Monitor<sup>2</sup> system encapsulates a flexible set of general-purpose components to monitor the operation and connectivity of heterogeneous sensor devices (e.g. smart watches, smart phones, microphones, beacons, etc.), a local base-station, as well as a cloud server. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports different types of RRMSs in various contexts. The system also features a ground truth validation system to support obtaining ground truth in the field.

However, there are still numerous technological challenges to be solved particularly related to the time-critical Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of such applications. Runtime variations in the workload intensity as the amount of service tasks to be processed may radically affect the application performance perceived by the end-users or lead to the underutilization of resources. In order to assure the QoS of these containerized applications, monitoring is required at both container and application levels. Currently, there is a great lack of such multi-level monitoring systems.

This research takes up this challenge by storing and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research, sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner.

IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely via internet such as changing the room temperature by controlling an air conditioner, switching on the lights in your apartment, using smart watches to gather information about your body health (blood pressure and heart beat rate) and sends it to your private doctor to monitor it and so on. Performing a research on issues faced with IoT, it was realized that most challenges were of privacy/confidentiality and data integrity. This project further conducts research on finding ways of securing information that is shared between two or more interactive IoT devices. The main objective of the project was to develop a strategy of securing the IoT technology world. The method that was proposed to provide data security and integrity was through cryptographic methods/security algorithms that require decent memory and equitable CPU processing power. There were three security methods that were focused on in this project i.e. RSA, AES and TDES algorithms. Each of the encryption/decryption methods were presented with their detailed design and functionality. The most suitable and better performing security algorithm for IoT technology was chosen according to the measures of time, memory and processing power. With the tests performed on the proposed security algorithms, AES encryption standard seemed to perform better than other security algorithms in terms computational time, memory consumption and the required processing power. The test results also showed that it has a large encryption/decryption key size which also means better protection for data. However, through testing of the encryption methods there were shortcomings that were encountered such as inability of the security algorithms to provide authentication and encrypt different data formats such as video, picture and aud- o. The short comings will be further dealt with on the future work. The success of this research has potential impact on increasing the security of IoT internetwork which intern will increase the number of users in the IoT world.","","POD:978-1-5386-3837-8","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102332","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102332","AES;IoT;RSA;TDES;cryptography;security algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Ciphers;Encryption;Public key;Standards","Internet of Things;computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;internetworking","AES encryption standard;IoT internetwork;IoT technology world;IoT world;cryptographic methods;data formats;data integrity;data security;encryption methods;encryption-decryption key size;encryption-decryption methods;equitable CPU processing power;interactive IoT devices;security algorithms;security methods","","","","","","","","May 30 2017-June 2 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to - ake appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4815-1; POD:978-1-5090-4816-8; USB:978-1-5090-4814-4","10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101902","Arrhythmia Neural-Net;Arrhythmia classification;Arrhythmia detection;ECG FHIR;ECG signal processing;GP Connect;HAPI FHIR;HL7;Healthcare monitoring;MITDB Physionet;SNOMED-CT FHIR;Wearable IoT","Adaptive filters;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Real-time systems","adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising","3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG classification;ECG event observations;ECG kits biopotential measurements;ECG monitoring;ECG waveforms;FHIR interoperability;MIT-BIH Physionet;MITDB arrhythmia database;SNOMED coding system;Savitzky-Golay filter;arrhythmia classification;electronic health records database;feature extraction method;healthcare interoperability;heart rate variability analysis;kNN classifiers;machine learning models;neural net fitting models;personalized health-care monitoring devices;personalized wearable systems;recursive least square adaptive filter;signal processing;wearable biomedical devices;wearable health monitoring devices","","","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on such monitoring, anomalies and trends can be discovered, which possibly allows for early assessment of health issues and for prevention policies. However, when dealing with the home environment, and especially with older adults, obtrusiveness, usability, and cost concerns are of the utmost relevance. Smart objects can be designed to this purpose and deployed into the home: they usually feature low data rates and are customarily implemented by relying on conventional wireless sensor network approaches (ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc). This, however, results in “ad hoc” home networking, which is somehow obtrusive, complicated, and possibly expensive. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of behavioral sensors based on the familiar and ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology, suitable for a “plug-and-play” deployment. Sensors are connected to a cloud platform, embodying a genuine Internet of Things approach. With respect to conventional approaches, much better scalability, flexibility, and inexpensiveness can be attained. The main expected drawback comes from the higher power consumption, inherently needed to sustain much higher data rates. This paper focuses on such an issue, illustrating design techniques aimed at optimizing power consumption and battery lifetime. Performance results are shown, which definitely fall within a practical range and are fully comparable with more conventional approaches.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2017.2753458","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057592","Active assisted living;Internet of Things (IoT);Wi-Fi;continuous monitoring;smart homes","Assisted living;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Smart homes;Wireless fidelity;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;ad hoc networks;assisted living;cloud computing;computerised monitoring;home networks;radiotelemetry;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","AAL Wi-Fi;AAL Wi-Fi-based monitoring system;Internet of Things approach;IoT approach;active assisted living paradigm;ad hoc home networking;battery lifetime;behavioral sensors;cloud platform;daily living activities;data rates;design techniques;home environment;low data rates;plug-and-play deployment;power consumption;prevention policies;smart objects;ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology;unobtrusive monitoring;wireless sensor network approaches","","","","","","","20171003","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for predicting activities from sensor data.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2750669","10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100000070 - National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031060","Activity prediction;digital prompting;regression learning;smart environments","Activity recognition;Environmental factors;Feature extraction;Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Smart homes;Training data","Internet of Things;home automation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;regression analysis;sensor fusion","Internet of Things;IoT platforms;activity prediction problem;imitation learning;large-scale sensing data;learning activity predictors;mobile-device-based activity prompter;sensor data;simple regression learning problem;smart home testbeds","","","","","","Traditional","20170911","Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Design-To-Cost (DTC) is an effective technique for this situation. In Model-Based Design (MBD), DTC cost estimates are preferred to be generated from models as one of the parameters to optimize the design. However, most cost modeling methods focus in estimation on costs associated with new product development, and much fewer discuss the estimate of the switching costs for new products that are designed leveraging previous products. In this paper, we explore certain available tools for DTC for such purposes and discuss their advantages/disadvantages. We performed an experimental study on a building PHM (Prognostic and Health Monitoring) sensing system design example, and demonstrated an approach to achieve switching cost estimation using parametric modeling by treating part of the new product as another prior product. Finally, a multi-objective optimization is used for design selection, to achieve the best trade-off between cost and performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3403-5; POD:978-1-5386-3404-2","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088305","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088305","","Buildings;Estimation;Hardware;Sensors;Software;Switches;Tools","Internet of Things;condition monitoring;costing;optimisation;product development;production engineering computing","DTC cost estimates;Design-To-Cost;Internet of Things;IoT;cost modeling methods;design selection;massive production;material selections;multiobjective optimization;parametric modeling tools;product development;switching cost estimation;switching costs;system design","","","","","","","","11-13 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data. The paper also outlines how these concepts extend to related topics such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Everything (IoE).

The diagnosis of OSA requires an overnight sleep experiment in a laboratory. However, due to limitations in relation to the number of labs and beds available, patients often need to wait a long time before being diagnosed and eventually treated. In addition, the unfamiliar environment and restricted mobility when a patient is being tested with a polysomnogram (PSG) may disturb their sleep, resulting in an incomplete or corrupted test. Therefore, it is posed that a PSG conducted in the patient’s home would be more reliable and convenient. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the e-Health system. In this paper, we implement an IoT-based wireless polysomnography system for sleep monitoring, which utilizes a battery-powered, miniature, wireless, portable, and multipurpose recorder. A Java-based PSG recording program in the personal computer is designed to save several bio-signals and transfer them into the European Data Format. These PSG records can be used to determine a patient’s sleep stages and diagnose OSA. This system is portable, lightweight, and has low power-consumption. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed PSG system, a comparison was made between the standard PSG-Alice 5® Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system. Several healthy volunteer patients participated in the PSG experiment and were monitored by both the standard PSG-Alice 5® Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system simultaneously, under the supervision of specialists at the Sleep Laboratory in Taipei Veteran General Hospital. A comparison of the results of the time-domain waveform and sleep stage of the two systems shows that the proposed system is reliable and can be applied in practice.

The current work proposes an agent-based simulation framework to simulate sleeper movements on a simulated smart bed with load sensors. This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors.

Though technology is advancing at a rapid rate but the question of an eco-friendly living remains unanswered. With growing population figures, the transportation requirement is increasing at a significant rate but the vehicular pollution arising from surface transport has serious health hazards besides polluting the nature. This paper proposes the design of a Pollution Monitoring Mobile System (PMMS) that can monitor vehicular pollution in real-time along with the information about the area being monitored. The prototype consists of a primary unit, a mobile robot that has a combination of Arduino and Raspberry Pi micro-controller boards simulating a zero-pollution mobile electric vehicle equipped with features such as obstacle avoidance, video surveillance and GPS tracking, and has an on-board local server. The secondary unit consists of a pollution monitor that collects several kinds of data such as temperature, sound level and different gas levels. The pollution monitor uses an Arduino micro-controller board and a combination of different sensors and a Wi-Fi module. The combined data from the primary unit and the secondary unit is sent to the local server. The data from the local server can then be logged/stored on a cloud service for detailed analysis of the data. The initial performance evaluation results are encouraging. This system is a robust, flexible, easily deployable and an eco-friendly solution, in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT), to the ever concerning problem of pollution.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6255-3; POD:978-1-5090-6256-0","10.1109/TENCONSpring.2017.8069982","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8069982","GPS tracking;IoT;eco-friendly;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;vehicular pollution;video surveillance;wireless","Mobile communication;Monitoring;Pollution;Servers;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;cloud computing;collision avoidance;electric vehicles;microcontrollers;mobile radio;mobile robots;pollution measurement;video surveillance;wireless LAN","Arduino microcontroller board;Pollution Monitoring Mobile System;health hazards;high pollution level regions;mobile robot;on-board local server;surface transport;terrestrial mobile monitoring system;transportation requirement;vehicular pollution;zero-pollution mobile electric vehicle","","","","","","","","14-16 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is identified as an easier technique and quick diagnoses of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a preventable acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Common diabetic test on patients are done on urinary test and blood ketone test to monitor for diabetes condition. However, those methods are considers as invasive, inconvenient and expensive. Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors. This research is significant where patients can independently monitor their diabetic health and the IoT system can be alerted directly to medial officers in the hospitals.","","CD:978-1-5090-4751-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-4752-9; POD:978-1-5090-4753-6","10.1109/ISCAIE.2017.8074971","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074971","Internet of Things;acetone;exhaled breath;ketone;personal monitoring system;sensor","Data collection;Databases;Diabetes;Gas detectors;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Wireless fidelity","Internet of Things;biomedical measurement;blood;diseases;gas sensors;health care;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;wireless LAN","Arduino board;ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module;Internet of things system;IoT-based personal health care monitoring device;blood ketone test;breath acetone;breath measurement;diabetic ketoacidosis;diabetic patients;diabetic test;gas sensor;handheld health care;hardware connection;ketone biomarker;mouthpiece;noninvasive breath test;patient diagnosis;patients exhalation;personal monitoring;type 1 diabetes mellitus;urinary test","","","","","","","","24-25 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data.

"ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare","A. Walinjkar; J. Woods","Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering University of Essex Colchester, Essex","2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)","20171009","2017","","","1","8","A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered a- d relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server.

A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude.

A big challenge in WSN is providing energy. Battery management and maintenance of these sensors can be a prohibitively expensive exercise because of their abundance. Sensors' performance will deteriorate with the remaining energy level and dead sensor nodes will affect the performance of an entire network, especially in multi-hop networks. Improper battery disposal will also cause environmental pollution and health hazardous in the long run. The energy issue can be alleviated by energy harvesting. The ambience has energy in the forms of light, heat, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiations.

Due to the large size of the monitoring objects (e.g., civil structure or the power grid), plenty of sensors need to be deployed and organized to be a large scale of multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which tends to have quite high transmission cost. In-network processing is an efficient way to reduce the transmission cost in WSNs. However, implementing in-network processing for above domain-specific monitoring usually requires to losslessly distribute a dedicate domain-specific algorithm into WSNs, which is much different from most existing in-network processing works. This paper conducts a case study of a classic centralized SHM algorithm, i.e., eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and shows how to losslessly and optimally in-network process ERA, especially the typical feature extraction method, i.e., that is singular value decomposition (SVD) therein, in a WSN. Based on whether the intermediate data can be processed together or not by sensor nodes, we respectively implement tree-based in-network processing of SVD and chain-based in-network processing of SVD in WSNs. We prove that using an appropriate shallow light tree as routes for tree-based in-network processing of SVD, can achieve the approximation ratio ${text{1}}+sqrt{2}$ (in terms of transmission cost), while for the chain-based in-network processing of SVD, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms for searching the optimal routes.

The oil and gas (O&G) industry cannot remain immune to the impact of IoT. O&G industry has one of the most complex operations of any industry. A simple error in operations could be fatal in terms of human life; hence the industry focuses a lot of health, safety, and environment (HSE) metrics, and the higher safety score of HSE derives the business strategy and then the revenue and profits. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is the name for remote monitoring and controlling machines using coded signals over communication channels. It is a type of industrial control system (ICS).

In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes. The system is flexible and can incorporate more policy rules, professionals, and data classes.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0752-7; POD:978-1-5386-0753-4","10.1109/ICWS.2017.111","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029854","Internet of Things;access control;ambient assisted living;authentication;multi-level access control","Access control;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;authorisation;data privacy;health care;home computing;medical computing;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;public key cryptography","ABAC;Internet of Things;IoT;IoT-based healthcare systems;PKI;ambient home solution framework;ambient sensors;attribute-based access control;biometric sensors;collected healthcare data;data classes;healthcare domain;high-level activity recognition task;mobile medical applications;multilevel access control;multilevel privacy-preserving Access Control;personal healthcare monitoring;privacy-preserving monitoring;public key infrastructure;security policies","","","","","","","","25-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1999-5; POD:978-1-5386-2000-7; USB:978-1-5386-1998-8","10.1109/AIMS.2017.11","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8027264","Analytics;Healthcare;IoT;Monitoring;Optimization;Text Mining;Wearable Technologies","Biomedical monitoring;Diseases;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Wearable sensors","Internet of Things;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;medical computing;recommender systems;text analysis","Internet of Things;IoT world;eventual diseases;health attributes;machine learning classification model;mathematical optimization model;optimal wearable devices;personalized advised wearables;proactive health monitoring;recommendation engine;recommendation system;structured demographic attributes;text mining;unstructured medical history;wearable technological devices","","","","","","","","25-30 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2725224","10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation IGERT grant through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy, New York University; 10.13039/100000015 - Department of Energy; 10.13039/100000144 - National Science Foundation IGERT grant through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy, New York University; 10.13039/100000150 - National Science Foundation IGERT grant through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy, New York University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972976","Internet of things;cyber-physical systems;cyber-security;perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium;signaling game;trust","Cloud computing;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;Security;Stability analysis;Sugar","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;game theory;trusted computing","APT;CPS;FlipIt game;GNE;Gestalt Nash equilibrium;Internet of Things;IoT;advanced persistent threats;cloud-assisted insulin pump;cloud-enabled cyber-physical systems;glucose control;simultaneous signaling game;strategic trust;trust mechanism","","","","","","","20170711","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.","1549-8328;15498328","","10.1109/TCSI.2017.2694968","Mubadala-SRC Center of Excellence for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems Research Contract; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927419","ECG;Internet of Things;biomedical classifier;design-for-trust;hardware security;ventricular arrythmia","Electrocardiography;Hardware;Integrated circuit modeling;Reverse engineering;Security;System-on-chip","Internet of Things;application specific integrated circuits;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;power aware computing;power consumption;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security","ECG signals;Internet-of-Things;IoT-enabled medical devices;application specific integrated circuits;cardiovascular diseases;chip-specific ECG;communication channel;design-for-trust solution;health-care sector;low power enhanced technology;low-power ECG-processors;multilayered security infrastructure;noninvasive patient monitoring;on-chip resources;secure IoT sensing-preprocessing platform;thwarting hardware security;ultralow power;ventricular arrhythmia","","","","","","","20170512","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Indeed, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been widely used for enabling many connected health applications in diverse areas including: activity recognition, elder care, sports, and rehabilitation. Although the number of transistors in an integrated circuit follows Moore's law, it does not apply to batteries. Thus, in BSNs, the sensor node's compact size means it has a strict energy constraint. At the same time, body sensor nodes have sensing requirements that should provide an acceptable level of data fidelity in order to accurately infer the amount and type of activity. This paper investigates the energy challenges associated with combining MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and ball-tube motion detectors for BSNs. We examine multiple scenarios using these sensor types for body motion characterization. We then investigate the feasibility of these technologies along with collaborative sensing with the aim of reducing overall energy consumption. We conducted experiments examining sedentary (i.e. no movement) and non-sedentary activities. Our results show the possibility of 67 % reduction in energy consumption during the sedentary periods only, while maintaining the required level of data fidelity for inferring motion types.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4722-2; POD:978-1-5090-4723-9; USB:978-1-5090-4721-5","10.1109/CHASE.2017.52","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010567","Accelerometer;Ball-tube;Collaborative sensing;Data fidelity;Energy consumption;Motion sensing","Accelerometers;Batteries;Collaboration;Energy consumption;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;bioMEMS;biomedical measurement;body sensor networks;motion measurement","Internet of Things;IoT;MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units;Moore's law;activity recognition;ball-tube motion detectors;connected health;data fidelity;elder care;fidelity-energy trade-off;non-sedentary activities;rehabilitation;sports;wearable health;wireless body sensor networks","","","","","","","","17-19 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart textiles were developed and provided to users who were asked to discuss their feelings whilst holding/interacting with a smart textile during a walk. In the study discussed, respondents spoke aloud while using prototype handheld smart textiles with wireless capability, soft switches and accelerometers. Voice recordings were collected and transformed into verbal transcripts which were comparatively analysed to assess their validity for understanding individuals' emotional states in Internet of Things-enabled mental health service design. This paper reports on the talk aloud protocol, and the creation of a data analytics model for semantically analysing the transcripts in order to identify the `anxious' from the `not so anxious' participants. The model comprises of two main parts: Latent Semantic Analysis, for semantically analysing the transcripts; and the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm to naturally place the data into the two groups.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking.

In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications. Moreover, we observe that latencies between a smartphone GW and cloud hosted services vary largely depending on the user mobility, and on the promotion delay of the used wireless network.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689682","builds upon software and datasets that resulted from I-City for Future Health; financed by the applicable financial framework: Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), through Portugal 2020 and the European Regional Development Fund, FCT/MEC through national funds and when applicable co-funded by FEDER PT2020 partnership agreement; project NanoSTIMA; 10.13039/501100001871 - direct funding by PT Inova¿¿¿¿o - Altice Labs.

This paper presents a case study on the conceptual architecture design in such an environment, and co-develops the architecture and the domain solution to improve prototyping rapidness. First, on applying systems thinking and technologies, during architecting, we include the tasks of meeting both functional and performance requirements especially with respect to analytics, in a single architecture description framework. Second, we study a domain-specific issue, where un-attempted methods must be researched, and provide a solution that re-uses existing system elements, through which the mutual impacts between the information from both architecture and domain solutions are shown. Practical and important issues including benefits, standards, and implementations are also explored as part of the required tasks for architecting.

The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively.

This paper proposes a lightweight, scalable agentless system which can be configured, setup, and begin monitoring network health within minutes. The architecture utilizes a polling script to query Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) demon for metrics, Prometheus Time Series Database instances for storage, and a Grafana Dashboard for metric presentation and alerting. The system design removes the learning curve necessary for most open source monitoring systems, while still providing similar metrics. The approach demonstrated here shows the ease and security with which specific site network monitoring can be deployed in a cloud configuration.

Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification.

Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks. We evaluated both protocols through a specific e-health scenario. Tests revealed the usage of mobile networks increases response time and overhead of both protocols, on average, when compared to traditional networks.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6196-9; POD:978-1-5090-6197-6","10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983155","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7983155","","Authentication;Middleware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Time factors","Internet of Things;computer network security;health care;medical computing;middleware;protocols;radiocommunication","DTLS protocols;Internet of Things;IoT applications;IoT middleware systems;IoT systems;TLS protocols;communication layer;communication services;e-health applications;e-health environment;mobile networks;network latency;packet loss","","","","","","","","8-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure.

To do so, we examine the requirements for orchestrating connected entities and address them with domainspecific design concepts.

However, by collecting and sharing information about building's inhabitants and their activities, these services also open the door to privacy risks.

Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements.

On the other hand, power consumption has become a major concern for almost every digital system, from the smallest embedded circuits to the biggest computer clusters, with all the shades in between. Fine-grain control mechanisms are then needed to cap power consumption at each level of the stack, still guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLA) to the hosted applications. In this work, we propose DockerCap, a software-level power capping orchestrator for Docker containers that follows an Observe-Decide-Act loop structure: this allows to quickly react to changes that impact on the power consumption by managing resources of each container at run-time, to ensure the desired power cap.

Modern building has several monitoring and control systems which should cooperate together to achieve energy saving while keeping indoor comfort and healthy environment. The overall building management systems (BMS) provides an integrated way to gather data from the building and issue control commands to the installed technology. The parameters that are monitored in modern buildings are not only temperature and humidity but todays buildings monitor also concentration values of CO2 or volatile organic compounds (VOC). The experience from last decades shows necessity to monitor also the structure of the building. Renewable materials (wood) are today often used for building construction. This material is quite sensitive to environmental factors like humidity and the environment has to be monitored in order to avoid structural health problems in future. Specially timber when exposed to humidity or moisture can degrade quite quickly and can lose load capacity. Modern communication technologies allows installation of many sensors directly into the structure which allows continuous monitoring of the building construction as well as the indoor climate in the building.

The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to the battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, and the susceptibility of devices to cyber and physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and the information dissemination in the presence of adversaries.

An IoT device is a kind of real-time systems, of which power-savings have been widely studied in terms of processor's dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. However, recent research has shown that memory subsystems are getting reached to a significant portion of power consumption in such systems. In this paper, we show that power consumption of real-time systems can be further reduced by combining voltage/frequency scaling with task allocation in hybrid memory. If a task set is schedulable in a low voltage mode of a processor, we can expect that the task set will still be schedulable even with slow memory. By considering this, we adopt non-volatile memory technologies that consume less power than DRAM but provide relatively slow access latency. Our aim is to allocate tasks in non-volatile memory if it does not violate the deadline constraint of real-time tasks, thereby reducing the power consumption of the system further. To do so, we incorporate the memory allocation problem into the problem model of processor's voltage scaling, and evaluate the effectiveness of the combined approach.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5507-4; POD:978-1-5090-5508-1","10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960033","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7960033","dynamic voltage scaling;hybrid memory;internet-of-things (IoT);non-volatile memory;real-time task scheduling","Magnetic tunneling;Memory management;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change materials;Power demand;Random access memory;Real-time systems","Internet of Things;power aware computing;processor scheduling;random-access storage;real-time systems;storage management","Internet-of-Things;battery-based IoT devices;energy-efficient IoT task scheduling;hybrid memory;memory allocation;memory subsystems;nonvolatile memory technologies;power consumption reduction;power-savings;processor dynamic voltage-frequency scaling;processor voltage scaling;real-time systems;real-time task deadline constraint;task allocation","","","","","","","","24-26 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a fully printed sensor capable of noninvasive material thickness detection. By applying an oscillating signal between two millimeter-scale electrodes, the fringing electric field is measurably perturbed by a material placed directly on top of the electrodes, leading to a linearly varying capacitance with change in the material's thickness. We simulate this electric field perturbation and experimentally demonstrate the linear correlation between capacitance and overlying material thickness. Various parameters, from sensor size and structure to substrate and ink materials, are studied to optimize the performance of the printed sensors. Sensors made of metallic carbon nano-tube ink yield the best sensitivity, exhibiting a capacitance change of 26 fF per mm thickness of rubber-ten times more sensitive than devices composed of silver nanoparticle ink. Finally, we demonstrate an effective application of the sensors in automobile tires. By applying the sensors directly beneath the tread (within the tire), mm changes in the tread depth are able to be detected in a 99% confidence interval. These findings provide a straightforward, low-cost approach for monitoring mm changes in material thickness using noninvasive, printed sensors applicable to innumerable Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2710085","Fetch Automotive Design Group, LLC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936474","Aerosol jet printing;Internet-of-Things (IoT);carbon nanotubes;material thickness detection;printed sensors","Capacitance;Capacitance measurement;Capacitive sensors;Electrodes;Ink;Substrates","Internet of Things;carbon nanotubes;electric sensing devices;nanoparticles;nanosensors;silver;thickness measurement","Ag;C;Internet-of-Things;aerosol jet printed sensors;electric field perturbation;metallic carbon nanotube ink;noninvasive material thickness detection;silver nanoparticle ink","","","","","","","20170531","July15, 15 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Gadallah","The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt","IEEE Access","20170623","2017","5","","10744","10756","A reliable wireless sensor network (WSN) is defined as a network that functions satisfactorily, in terms of both its coverage and connectivity to the sink(s), throughout its intended mission time. Deploying reliable WSNs is especially important for critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as industrial, structural health-monitoring, and military applications. In such applications, failure of the WSN to carry out its required tasks can have serious effects, and hence, cannot be tolerated. However, the deployment of reliable WSNs is a challenging problem. This is primarily attributed to the fact that sensor nodes are subject to random failures due to different factors, such as hardware failures, battery depletion, harsh environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, the problem of deploying a WSN with a specified minimum level of reliability at a minimum deployment cost is addressed. This problem is coined the minimum cost reliability constrained sensor node deployment problem (MCRC-SDP). The MCRC-SDP is proved to be an NP-Complete. An ant colony optimization algorithm coupled with a local search heuristic is proposed as a solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding high-quality solutions to the problem.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2711484","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938614","Wireless sensor networks;ant colony optimization;greedy heuristic;local search;network reliability;sensor node deployment","Ant colony optimization;Measurement;Monitoring;Optimization;Reliability engineering;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;ant colony optimisation;computational complexity;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT applications;MCRC-SDP;NP-complete;WSN;ant colony optimization approach;battery depletion;hardware failures;harsh environmental conditions;local search heuristic;minimum cost reliability constrained sensor node deployment problem;reliable wireless sensor network deployment;structural health-monitoring","","","","","","OAPA","20170605","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, the high-power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements if not equipped with backscattering technologies such as RFID. This work shows how a quantum tunneling RFID tag enables the use of RFIDs in new applications by minimizing battery waste and by drastically improving the range of backscattering systems. The highly sensitive 5.8 GHz quantum tunneling RFID tag achieves backscattering free space ranges above 1.2 km while consuming biasing powers as low as 20.4 μW. This is over 10 times higher than the maximum range of a semi-passive 5.8 GHz RFID ideal link. The quantum tunneling tag is characterized by return gains as high as 35 dB, a simple RF front-end, a sensitivity of -84 dBm, and increasing SNRs for increasing RF impinging powers.

HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3716-2; POD:978-1-5090-3717-9","10.1109/ICCCSP.2017.7944086","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944086","Cardiovascular disease;Diabetic mellitus;Heart Rate Variability (HRV);Hypertension;Internet of Things (IoT);Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT);Transport Level Security (TLS);Zigbee","Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate variability;Hypertension;Monitoring;Servers;ZigBee","Internet of Things;Zigbee;biomedical telemetry;cardiology;diseases;electronic messaging;file servers;patient monitoring;protocols;telemedicine;wireless LAN","HRV analysis;HRV parameters;Internet of Things technology;IoT-based remote HRV monitoring system;MQTT protocol;WiFi technology;Wireless Zigbee-based pulse sensor;Zigbee technology;cardiovascular disease;diabetic mellitus;disease states;heart rate variability;hypertensive patients;short message service","","","","","","","","10-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles.

According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing- into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used. The output of the LSTM network is deciding the current life condition of components and offering the alerts for components before the end of their life.

In the medical field, staff members of a certain hospital are in need for a system that tracks where patients/medical staff/devices are at any given time. LoCATE, which is Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment, provides a near-real time tracking tool for medical systems using the existing 802.11 WiFi infrastructure. The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara<sup>®</sup> RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions. While implications for an IoT system such as LoCATE are wide-ranging; its primary objective is to provide an easy to use, low-cost solution to track the location of medical assets in real-time.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1848-6; POD:978-1-5386-1849-3","10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937703","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937703","Cloud Computing;E-Health Care;Internet of Things (IoT);Localization","Cloud computing;Hospitals;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Transmitters;Wireless communication;Wireless fidelity","Internet of Things;Web services;cloud computing;diseases;health care;medical information systems;radiofrequency identification;wireless LAN","Amazon Web Services;Internet of Things;IoT technology;LoCATE system;Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment;RFID technology;Sentara RMH hospital;WiFi infrastructure;cloud computing platform;cloud storage platform;disease;health care system;medical asset location;medical system;mobile app;near-real time tracking tool;patient health data;radiofrequency identification;real-time location data;wireless technology","","1","","","","","","28-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.","","","10.1109/TETCI.2017.2699218","National Research Fund of Luxembourg; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935485","Autonomic computing;IoT-based system;big data;cognitive computing;design patterns","Big Data;Complex systems;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Monitoring;Scalability","Big Data;Internet of Things;cognitive systems;fault tolerant computing;health care;medical information systems","Big Data;Internet of Things;autonomic cognitive IoT-based systems;autonomic cognitive design patterns;cognitive monitoring system;health care;heterogeneous large-scale data stream integration;heterogeneous large-scale data stream processing;heterogeneous wearable devices;model-driven methodology;patient health management;response time;scalability management;smart IoT-based systems;system functional requirements;system nonfunctional requirements;system performance evaluation","","3","","","","","","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the age of industrial Internet of Things, a smart production unit can be perceived as a large connected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics that can relay data and communicate with each other. While, traditionally, the focus has been on machine health and predictive maintenance, the manufacturing industry has also started focusing on analyzing data from the entire production line. These applications bring a new set of analytics challenges. Unlike traditional data mining analysis, which consists of lean datasets (that is, datasets with few features), manufacturing has fat datasets. In addition, previous approaches to manufacturing analytics restricted themselves to small time periods of data. The latest advances in big data analytics allows researchers to do a deep dive into years of data. Bosch collects and utilizes all available information about its products to increase its understanding of complex linear and nonlinear relationships between parts, machines, and assembly lines. This helps in use cases such as the discovery of the root cause of internal defects.

The target of learning two projection matrices is to maximize the inter-class data and minimize the intra-class data. Meanwhile, we propose the class-constrained regularization which enforces the neighboring samples with the same class to be still close to each other so as to further improve the discrimination of CTLDA. The class-constrained regularization possesses two strategies, i.e., hard constraint and soft constraint.

Therefore, it is crucial that each entity has the capability of safeguarding its security features on its own. Methods based on harnessing the random identification and authentication from the physical device and environment, such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), if securely run, are promising primitives for protecting lightweight IoT devices. This paper presents the first Built-In-Self-Test scheme for on-the-fly evaluation of PUFs that can also be utilized for assessing the desired statistical properties of TRNGs. Unlike earlier known PUF evaluation suites that were software-based and offline, our methodology enables online assessment of the pertinent statistical and security properties all in hardware. Specifically, the BIST structure is designed to evaluate two main properties of PUFs: unpredictability and stability. Our work is the first online test suite that thoroughly evaluates the internal health of the entropy source of TRNGs along with the statistical properties of the generated bit stream. Comprehensive real-time evaluation by the BIST method is able to ensure robustness and security of both TRNG and PUF in the face of operational, structural, and environmental fluctuations due to variations, aging, or adversarial acts. Proof-of-concept implementation of our BIST methodology in FPGA demonstrates its reasonable overhead, effectiveness, and practicality.","","","10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2519902","Multidisciplinary Research Program of the University Research Initiative; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100000006 - Office of Naval Research; 10.13039/100000181 - Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387751","BIST;Built-In-Self-Test;IoT;hardware security;internet of things;physical unclonable functions;puf;trng;true random number generators","Built-in self-test;Entropy;Field programmable gate arrays;Generators;Jitter;Security;Stability analysis","","","","1","","51","","","20160120","Jan.-March 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A five layered architecture of IoV is proposed considering functionalities and representations of each layer. A protocol stack for the layered architecture is structured considering management, operational, and security planes. A network model of IoV is proposed based on the three network elements, including cloud, connection, and client.

Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data.

A target tracking and acquisition application is presented in detail to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the proposed design. Complete design details of the platform are also presented. The designed module implements the basic proportional-integral-derivative control and a custom target acquisition algorithm. Details of the sliding-window-based algorithm are also presented. This algorithm performs $20\times $ faster than comparable approaches in OpenCV with equal accuracy. Additional modules can be integrated for more complex applications, such as search-and-rescue, automatic object tracking, and traffic congestion analysis. A hardware architecture for the newly introduced Better Portable Graphics (BPG) compression algorithm is also introduced in the framework of the extensible quadrotor architecture. Since its introduction in 1987, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) graphics format has been the de facto choice for image compression. However, the new compression technique BPG outperforms the JPEG in terms of compression quality and size of the compressed file. The objective is to present a hardware architecture for enhanced real-time compression of the image.

As these systems are generally battery operated, major research efforts focus on reducing power consumption, especially for communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the most power-hungry components of a WSN. Moreover, with the advent of energy-neutral systems, the emphasis has shifted toward research in microwatt (or even nanowatt) communication protocols or systems. A significant number of wake-up radio receiver (WUR) architectures have been proposed to reduce the communication power of WSN nodes. In this work, we present an optimized ultra-low power (nanowatt) wake-up receiver for use in WSNs, designed with low-cost off-the-shelf components. The wake-up receiver achieves power consumption of 152 nW (with -32 dBm sensitivity), sensitivity up to -55 dBm (with maximum power of 1,2 μW), latency from 8 μs, tunable frequency, and short commands communication. In addition, a low power solution, which includes addressing capability directly in the wake-up receiver, is proposed. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate low power consumption, functionality, and benefits of the design optimization compared with other solutions, as well as the benefits of addressing false positive (FP) outcomes reduction.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2016.2524982","SCOPES SNF; SFI Marei Centre and Analog Devices at UCC.; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399719","Nanowatt wake-up radio receiver (WUR);Power Optimization.;Ultra Low Power;Wireless Sensor Networks;power optimization;ultra-low power;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Optimization;Power demand;Receivers;Rectifiers;Sensitivity;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;radio receivers;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WSN;WSN nodes;WUR architectures;communication protocols;environmental monitoring;flexible low latency nanowatt wakeup radio receiver;home automation;mobile health;power consumption;radio transceiver;wireless sensor networks","","18","","26","","","20160205","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Vehicle crashes on the roads and highways cost loss of lives and damages to properties. Technology exists today to help identify and respond quickly to crashes, which is specially critical in rural areas. A feature that enables a car to warn its driver against an eminent crash or to recommend the proper speed based on traffic and weather conditions is much needed in today's Internet of Things (IoT) era. Connected Vehicle (CV) technologies are contributing towards fulfilling this need. In this paper, we present a safety driving system through a cooperative hazard awareness and avoidance (CHAA) system based on V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communications. Our approach is based on DSRC-based V2V communications. It aims to alert drivers and recommend the proper speeds for vehicles that are approaching a hazardous zone due, for instance, to low visibility conditions. We also validate the proposed hazard alert and speed recommender system under various scenarios through simulations using the iTetris platform and SUMO simulator and we demonstrate its outperformance, compared to a regular environment, in terms of risk reduction and road safety efficiency. To this end, we have adapted iTetris by updating some of its existing features (like the Geo-broadcast routing capability) which is another contribution of this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6231-7; POD:978-1-5090-6232-4","10.1109/WAINA.2017.17","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929679","CHAA;CV;DSRC/WAVE;Road Safety;Road hazard;V2I;V2V","Hazards;Meteorology;Roads;Standards;Vehicle crash testing;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;cooperative communication;road safety;road traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","CHAA system;DSRC-based V2V communication;Internet of Things;IoT;V2I communication;connected vehicle technology;cooperative hazard awareness and avoidance system;iTetris platform;public health issue;risk reduction;roadway safety;traffic conditions;vehicle crash;vehicle-to-infrastructure communication;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;weather conditions","","","","","","","","27-29 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effective bearing fault diagnosis is important for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and operating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitoring systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals acquired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification performance on various bearing faults under different working conditions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the presented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds.","0093-9994;00939994","","10.1109/TIA.2017.2661250","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836314","Acoustic emission (AE) sensor;bearing fault diagnosis;deep learning;large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network","Big data;Fault diagnosis;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Machinery;Neurons;Signal processing","acoustic signal processing;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);machine bearings;mechanical engineering computing","LAMSTAR neural network;STFT;acoustic emission signals;bearing fault diagnosis;deep learning based approach;large memory storage retrieval;sensor signal preprocessing;short-time Fourier transform;spectrum matrix","","","","","","","20170130","May-June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since IoT applications are mainly for smart sensing, such as metering, home surveillance, disaster detection, and e-health, their special sensing/uploading behaviors will result in periodic and/or event-driven small data transmissions, which may potentially decrease the radio resource efficiency. On the other hand, the widespread deployment of IoT raises the concurrent massive connectivity of IoT devices. How to solve these two problems is a critical issue. In this paper, we investigate an uplink resource allocation problem which considers the periodic, event-driven, and query-based IoT traffic behaviors over LTE-M. The proposed approach takes advantage of data aggregation and both spatial and temporal reuse. Our solution exploits long-term static scheduling for periodic data to ensure the latency and data rate, and employs short-term dynamic scheduling for event-driven, query-based data to improve transmission efficiency. Therefore, both small data and massive connectivity problems are relieved. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve resource efficiency and enlarge network capacity effectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4183-1; POD:978-1-5090-4184-8","10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925549","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7925549","","Data aggregation;Delays;Dynamic scheduling;Logic gates;Quality of service;Resource management;Uplink","Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;data aggregation;data communication;frequency allocation;query processing;radio links;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","Internet of Things;IoT applications;IoT deployment;LTE-M networks;M2M communication;data aggregation;event-driven small data transmissions;long-term static scheduling;machine-to-machine communication;massive connectivity problems;network capacity;periodic data transmissions;query-based IoT traffic behaviors;radio resource efficiency;resource efficiency improvement;short-term dynamic scheduling;small data connectivity problems;smart sensing;spatial aggregation;spatial reuse;temporal aggregation;temporal reuse;transmission efficiency improvement;uplink resource allocation problem","","","","","","","","19-22 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues.

This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia.

Proper hand hygiene is the single biggest defense against spread of diseases and therefore the caregivers' compliance with hand hygiene is one of the most effective tools in preventing Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) in such institutions. In this paper, we present a system prototype of interconnected hand-hygiene stations that use a combination Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies for monitoring the hand hygiene compliance rate.

In this paper, the various medical services of IoT such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), Internet of m-health, community healthcare, indirect emergency healthcare and embedded gateway configuration are surveyed. Further, the applications of IoT in sensing the glucose level, ECG monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, wheelchair management, medication management and rehabilitation system are analyzed. The analysis results show that the use of IoT in the medical field increases the quality of life, user experience, patient outcomes and real-time disease management. The introduction of medical IoT is not without security challenges. Hence, the security threats such as confidentiality, authentication, privacy, access control, trust, and policy enforcement are analyzed. The presence of these threats affect the performance of IoT, thus, the cryptographic algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) are used. The investigation on these techniques proves that the RSA provides better security than the AES and DES algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1338-8; POD:978-1-5090-1339-5","10.1109/CAST.2016.7914983","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914983","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES);Data Encryption Standard (DES);Internet of Things (IoT);Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA);medical applications;medical services;security threats","Access control;Biomedical monitoring;Encryption;Medical services;Monitoring","Internet of Things;assisted living;authorisation;data privacy;health care;human factors;medical computing;mobile computing;public key cryptography;trusted computing","AAL;AES algorithm;DES algorithm;ECG monitoring;Internet of Things;Internet of m-health;IoT applications;RSA algorithm;Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm;advanced encryption standard algorithm;ambient assisted living;blood pressure monitoring;community healthcare;cryptographic algorithms;data authentication;data confidentiality;data encryption standard algorithm;data privacy;embedded gateway configuration;glucose level sensing;indirect emergency healthcare;medical services;medication management;patient outcomes;policy enforcement;quality of life;real-time disease management;rehabilitation system;security threats;trusting computing;user experience;wheelchair management","","1","","","","","","19-21 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To keep data traces of IoT devices, provenance can play a vital role as it solves many issues related to data trustworthiness, decision-making, data reconciliation and data replication.

To overcome these key challenging issues a new system have been implemented for monitoring the contaminated water quality by adapting new technologies such as IoT(Internet of Things), WSN's(Wireless sensor network) and communication standards. IoT and WSN's have been grabbed attention towards it in all real time applications (Manufacturing system, Health care system and Industrial monitoring systems) for providing worldwide network to each interconnected objects for collecting data about physical things by using standard communication protocol. The performance analysis of the proposed systems is carried out by collecting water parameters data from different sensing elements (Turbidity, Density, Temperature and PH) at base station and comparing with its threshold value at the monitoring unit.

The ability of plants to detoxify these compounds makes biological systems the promising technologies for this purpose. Although precise mechanisms how plants remove VOC are unknown and current knowledge is based on experiments conducted under controlled conditions, it does not prevent us not to use biological air purifiers. Our measurements under uncontrolled conditions in environments where people live, showed that houseplants' ability to reduce VOC differs from one to another environment.

IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework.

Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-qu- lity expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2632822","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828160","Internet of things;smart home healthcare systems;usability;wireless-sensor network","Collaboration;Context modeling;Medical services;Predictive models;Smart homes;Technological innovation;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;health care;home computing;patient care;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Kvale approach;WSN-SHHS application;WSN-SHHS research;WSN-based smart home healthcare system;generic technology adoption model;home healthcare agency;home healthcare patient;human detachment;life-quality expectancy;patient-centered care;patients adoption;pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model;predictive power accounting;smart telecommunication technology;technology adoption theory;wireless sensor network","","1","","","","","20170120","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this talk, we will discuss the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) since several game-changing technological advances happened on `mobile things' such as mobile phones, trains, and cars, where rich sets of sensors, connected via diverse sets of wireless Internet technologies, are changing and influencing how people communicate, move, and download and distribute information. In this space, challenges come from the needs to determine (1) contextual information such as location, duration of contact, density of devices, utilizing networked sensory information; (2) higher level knowledge such as users' activity detection, mood detection, applications usage pattern detection and user interactions on `mobile things', utilizing contextual information; and (3) adaptive and real-time parallel and distributed architectures that integrate context, activity, mood, usage patterns into mobile application services on mobile `things'.

Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques.

Because many of these desired insights have high temporal value, such as occupancy during emergency situations, such insights are needed in real time. However, augmenting buildings with new sensors is often expensive and requires a significant capital investment. In this paper, we propose and describe the real-time, streaming system called Namatad that we developed to infer insights from many sensors typical of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. We evaluate the effectiveness of this platform by leveraging machine learning to infer new insights from environmental sensors within buildings.

With BigData analytics becoming mainstream since the turn of the century and the growing need to leverage real-time data to grow business, several real-time systems are being researched and deployed in the consumer space. Although a lot of emphasis is being laid on real-time processing, the notion of real-time is not well defined. This, in part, stems from the fact that the notion of real-time is a function of the target application.

Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations. In addition, a parallel random forest algorithm is developed using the MapReduce framework and then implemented on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Experimental results have shown that the random forest algorithm can generate very accurate predictions.

To overcome, this problem in the IoT, we have proposed a novel architecture for building a service using open authentication protocol where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system through the IoT device.

OAuth provides client applications secure delegated access which is commonly used for Internet users to log in to third party websites using their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts without exposing their password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the user, giving the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. We are proposing a smart fire alarm system that notifies the user about the occurrence of fire in his house. User gets an alert message through his twitter and Gmail account simultaneously. Fire alarm system is built by integrating IoT technology with temperature detecting sensors. In order to use Gmail and twitter our device need to authenticate on behalf of the user. For this we use OAuth protocol for delegated access to applications like Gmail and twitter. Conventional end-to-end encryption based techniques are not accurate to ensure better quality of security because of exceeding slow response time of the smart devices, and has extremely low processing clock speed. The proposed wo- k can offer very high level of security without compromising on the processing lack. Results shows that, device offers a low latency as compared to existing system having with 35 to 45 milliseconds for implementing the OAuthenticaion scheme.","","DVD:978-1-5090-1283-1; Electronic:978-1-5090-1285-5; POD:978-1-5090-1286-2","10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823267","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823267","Authorization;Internet of things;open authentication (OAUTH) Protocol","","Internet of Things;alarm systems;data protection;fires;message authentication;open systems;protocols;social networking (online);software architecture","Gmail account;Internet of Things;IoT;OAuth protocol;Twitter;data access;data privacy;data protection;open authentication protocol;service architecture;smart fire alarm system","","1","","","","","","26-27 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an indigenous mobile health (or mHealth) solution, named GRAVID, to address the gap of unavailability of context-based information on nutrition, medical, drug and substance use appropriate to meet identified needs of gravid women and subsequently their babies (for 5 years); within the African context. GRAVID also provides a monitoring tool for healthcare givers to track the progress of the gravid woman they oversee. The project was implemented with Android software development kit (SDK) for cost-effective development and widespread community coverage.

Our study finds that whilst cryptographic algorithms for confidentiality and authenticity are supported in hardware on a popular class of devices, there is no adequate support for random number generation available. We show how to non-invasive manipulate the on-board source for randomness, and thereby we can completely undermine the security provided by (otherwise) strong cryptographic algorithms, with devastating results.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1138-4; POD:978-1-5090-1139-1","10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823912","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823912","","","Internet of Things;cryptography;random number generation","CC2538;Internet of Things;cryptographic randomness;data authenticity;data confidentiality;random number generation;security features","","","","","","","","4-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application.

At the same time, in the decade, we have witnessed the fast growing deployment of billions of sensors and actuators in multiple applications domains, such as transportation, manufacturing, connected/wearable health care, smart city and so on, stimulating the emerging of Edge Computing (a.k.a., fog computing, cloudlet). However, data, as the core of both cloud computing and edge computing, is still owned by each stakeholder and rarely shared due to privacy concern and formidable cost of data transportation, which significantly limits Internet of Things (IoT) applications that need data input from multiple stakeholders (e.g., video analytics collects data from cameras owned by police department, transportation department, retailer stores, etc.). In this paper, we envision that in the era of IoT the demand of distributed big data sharing and processing applications will dramatically increase since the data producing and consuming are pushed to the edge of the network. Data processing in collaborative edge environment needs to fuse data owned by multiple stakeholders, while keeping the computation within stakeholders' data facilities. To attack this challenge, we propose a new computing paradigm, Firework, which is designed for big data processing in collaborative edge environment (CEE). Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of datasets and a set of functions, where the functions are privacy preserved and bound to the datasets. Firework targets to share data while ensuring data privacy and integrity for stakeholders. By pushing the data processing as close as to da- a sources, Firework also aims to avoid data movement from the edge of the network to the cloud and improve the response latency.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5409-1; POD:978-1-5090-5410-7","10.1109/HotWeb.2016.12","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785712","","","Big Data;Internet of Things;cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy","CEE;Firework;Internet of Things;IoT;actuators;cloud computing;collaborative edge environment;data integrity;data privacy;data sources;data transportation;distributed Big Data processing;distributed Big Data sharing;edge computing;geographic distributed data fusion;multiple applications domains;sensors;stakeholder data facility;virtual shared data views","","","","","","","","24-25 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cost savings for such applications can go up to 67%. Additional intermediate layer DCs close to the root DC can be marginally cost beneficial for the compute intensive applications with medium or low demand locality.

Traditional technologies (e.g., using cameras or accelerometers and gyroscopes) may introduce privacy issues or require people to wear sensors. To address these issues, recent approaches exploit fine-grained wireless signals for activity recognition. However, these approaches require devices that are costly or need to provide unique wireless features (e.g., Doppler shifts or phase information). With the increasingly available Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in this paper, we propose Harmony, a human activity recognition and monitoring middleware which can utilize the coarse-grained (but pervasively available) received signal strength (RSS) measurements from the radios of IoT devices. We implement a complete evaluation platform (from data collection to data analysis) of the middleware on top of low cost ZigBee compliant MICAz nodes and a laptop. We also conducted extensive experiments. Our results show that our design can achieve similar accuracy as fine-grained WiFi channel state information (CSI) measurement-based approaches.

Recent proposals simplify the communication management with graphical views or language extensions but still require programmers to explicitly manage communication. To liberate programmers from explicit communication management, this article revisits heterogeneous distributed shared memory (HDSM) for IoT devices and proposes a compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework, called IoT-HDSM. The framework's compiler unifies heterogeneous memory layouts of different IoT devices, and the runtime system provides a shared memory view for the devices. To support lightweight devices that cannot execute the runtime, the compiler automatically inserts explicit communication instructions into the IoT application. Moreover, to efficiently control concurrent memory accesses without locks, the authors also propose a new annotation called the memory branch, which provides a memory snapshot for each device. This article describes the implementation of three IoT services with IoT-HDSM and shows that IoT-HDSM simplifies shared data management without harming QoS.","0272-1732;02721732","","10.1109/MM.2016.103","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765242","Internet of Things;heterogeneous distributed shared memory;memory branch","Biomedical monitoring;Distributed processing;Heterogeneous networks;Home automation;Internet of things;Memory management;Runtime","Internet of Things;computer network management;concurrency control;distributed shared memory systems;program compilers","IoT-HDSM;communication management;compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework;concurrent memory access control;heterogeneous distributed shared memory;heterogeneous memory layouts;lightweight Internet of Things devices;memory branch;shared data management","","2","","","","","","Nov.-Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The ultimate goal of currently used drugs and therapeutic strategies is the control of disease activity and the delay of the ongoing disability. During the last decades, a number of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), all products of advanced biotechnology are being used. However, these DMDs are yet partially effective since the ongoing disability progression may hardly be prevented. There is growing evidence that these DMDs might be more effective if more accurate monitoring of the disease itself throughout a period of time might be available. In the new era of MS treatment and on the basis of our current knowledge about MS management, it became pretty clear that the overall therapeutic strategy should always be scheduled on strictly individualized basis. To this, MS patients should be encouraged to take control over their own disease and collaborate more effectively with their doctors. The advent of the IoT (Internet of Things) and 5G mobile technologies can support patients in this direction. Since a snapshot of the overall patient's condition during a regular follow-up visit may not represent the every day reality of the patient, the advice given under these conditions may not be that effective. However, if hard data on the patient's motoric and cognitive performance were available “theragnostics” might be much more effective and efficient and a typical flare-up of the condition might be recognized much earlier - or even anticipated. Health 4.0 is the translation of Industrie 4.0 design principles into the health domain [36]. Health 4.0 is based on the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of cyber-physical systems to connect the physical and the virtual world. The use of smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors and cyber-physical systems in the management of MS could optimize the accuracy and allow for a preci- e mapping of symptoms over time which is an inevitable prerequisite for personalization of care. Ideally captured data would be processed in real time in order to flag problems up to the care team and on an individual basis anticipate motoric and / or cognitive deficits in an attempt to compensate for neurological deficits. 5G networks are expected to provide the infrastructure and ease in supporting various parameters recording on a real time basis. Relevant clinical studies may further highlight the need of information communication technology in MS management, thus contributing to the overall improvement of patent's quality of life (QoL). This is an absolute necessity for a variable, fluctuating and largely unpredictable disease such as MS.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3370-6; POD:978-1-5090-3371-3","10.1109/HealthCom.2016.7749437","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7749437","5G networks;Cyber-physical systems;Health 4.0;Individualized Medicine;IoT;Multiple Sclerosis;Smart pharmaceuticals;Theragnostics;e/m-Health","","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;biotechnology;cognition;cyber-physical systems;diseases;health care;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;patient treatment","(DMDs);5G mobile technologies;5G networks;Health 4.0:;Internet of Things;IoT;MS management;MS patients;MS treatment;QoL;advanced biotechnology;cyber-physical systems;disability progression;disease monitoring;disease- modifying drugs;neurological deficits;overall therapeutic strategy;patient cognitive performance;patient motoric performance;quality-of-life;smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors","","","","","","","","14-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, governments have implemented realtime environmental measurement systems and they have applied strategies focused to restrict the physical activities and avoid futures health problem. Even, in critical cases, the governments take measures to stop the movement of motor vehicles when the threshold of World Health Organization (WHO) is exceeded. The governmental measurement systems are limited because of high cost and they are typically located in big cities with few points of measure losing a lot of information in the uncovered areas. This work presents the development and implementation of a low cost georeferenced air-pollution measurement system that offers information of particulate measurement PM1, PM2.5 y PM10 by scatter. In addition, the system measures the levels of ozone concentration, and atmospheric variables such as temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. The whole system is connected to a low cost microprocessor with integrated Wi-Fi allowing to send the data to the cloud in real-time using MQTTprotocol, and thus the data can be georeferenced and published on an open access platform, used to the Internet of Things (IoT), for the acquisition and visualization of the data. In this way, the information is public and the residents of a particular area can look for the nearest measure of the environmental conditions. This work proposes a simple and cheap way to implement a measurement system allowing it to be easily replicated. The consequences for the health because of exposition to pollutants are serious, it implies a public policy issues with direct effect in the economy and development of cities. Because of all this, the air-pollution measurement systems should be improved and available in many more points.

SC-IAQM model provides low latency of critical data packets with high priority as well as reduces energy consumption of the network. Common indoor air pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compound, Particulate Matter and Methane are involved in this research. If the levels of these pollutants exceed the defined limits, sending the emergency services would be an option to deal with critical situation locally under the management of community center.

Condition monitoring systems have been widely applied to many industries to acquire operation and equipment related data, through which machine health state can be evaluated. One of the challenges of predicting future machine health lies in extracting the right features that are correlated well with the fault progression/degradation. We propose an enhanced restricted Boltzmann machine with a novel regularization term to automatically generate features that are suitable for remaining useful life prediction. The regularization term tries to maximize the trendability of the output features, which potentially better represent the degradation pattern of a system.

Thanks to the spread of Internet of Things (IoT), this complex activity can benefit also from the huge amount of data collected for other purposes. In this paper we propose techniques for exploiting the information available in the environment, considering several sources of information to analyse the interconnections of business processes.

Computation and infotainment are the two major areas where Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) electronics have made major contributions. Moving forward we expect to see their dominance in automotive applications. At the same time, we are seeing increased interest in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect trillions of sensors. We are preparing for Internet of Everything (IoE) applications where people, process, data and devices are going to be connected through new generation of electronics which are not possible today. Therefore, our research is focused on hybrid integration of heterogeneous materials, processes and devices to build free form (flexible, stretchable, reconfigurable in shape and size) interactive and high-performance electronics and systems for smart living and a sustainable future focusing on healthcare, water, food and environment. For scientific exploration, we develop integration strategy to make collective use of the materials, processes and device architecture leveraging multidisciplinary tracks of electrical engineering, material science, bioengineering, computer science and engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering (focusing plants and marine science) and health science. As engineering tool, we use CMOS technology extensively due to its industrial relevance, maturity and reliability for rapid tech transfer.

So the novelty of this IP is that it enables storage class memory which stands invisible to core as executable memory for low to medium sized IoT SoC's. Currently the devices available in the market have to be synced in to cloud or a device with higher memory bandwidth frequently as the inbuilt SRAM/DDR memory have limited executable memory space.

Billions of things are expected to be a part of IoT paradigm in the near future, providing enormous applications ranging from home automation, smart environment, health care, etc. One of the major hurdles for IoT to be effective with existing network architectures is a prolonged and seamless connectivity between the things and with the end user. Due to heterogeneity in the characteristics of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it has become a most prominent technology to bind the things with the Internet and with the end users. Wireless Sensor Networks are self healing and active in nature, that is, they can sense, instruct, request, respond and can easily be adopted to Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN). Addressing scheme in Wireless Sensor networks has to be foreseen if it has to be deployed in Internet of Things paradigm. This paper proposes a discrete cluster based addressing scheme on IEEE 802.15.4 standard for all the things included in a Wireless Sensor Network based IoT applications.

Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best.

It can be used for familiarizing researchers with the vast scope of research possible in this application domain. The smart city is primarily a concept, and there is still not a clear and consistent definition among practitioners and academia. As a simplistic explanation, a smart city is a place where traditional networks and services are made more flexible, efficient, and sustainable with the use of information, digital, and telecommunication technologies to improve the city's operations for the benefit of its inhabitants. Smart cities are greener, safer, faster, and friendlier. The different components of a smart city include smart infrastructure, smart transportation, smart energy, smart health care, and smart technology. These components are what make the cities smart and efficient. Information and communication technology (ICT) are enabling keys for transforming traditional cities into smart cities. Two closely related emerging technology frameworks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data (BD), make smart cities efficient and responsive. The technology has matured enough to allow smart cities to emerge. However, there is much needed in terms of physical infrastructure, a smart city, the digital technologies translate into better public services for inhabitants and better use of resources while reducing environmental impacts. One of the formal definitions of the smart city is the following: a city ""connecting the physical infrastructure, the information-technology infrastructure, the social infrastructure, and the business infrastructure to leverage the collective intelligence of the city"". Another formal and comprehensive definition is ""a smart sustainable city is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it- meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects"". Any combination of various smart components can make cities smart. A city need not have all the components to be labeled as smart. The number of smart components depends on the cost and available technology.","2162-2248;21622248","","10.1109/MCE.2016.2556879","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7539244","","Internet of things;Smart buildings;Smart cities;Smart grids;Transportation","Internet of Things;smart cities;sustainable development;town and country planning","BD;Big Data;ICT;Internet of Things;IoT;digital technology;information and communication technology;smart cities;smart sustainable city","","27","","","","","","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With billions of devices deployed, traditional manual preventive maintenance approaches will be cost prohibitive. As we make these small autonomous devices intelligent, it is critical that we also give them a very advanced ability to assess and report their own health. Of course, on-board diagnostics are not a new concept. What is new with the Internet of Things is the extreme economic leverage that the on-board diagnostics will have due to the huge number of devices to be developed. If the on-board diagnostics perform poorly, the resulting surge of support costs could be enough to drive the organization deploying the Internet of Things systems out of business. As an organization gets ready to release millions of a certain type of Internet of Things device into the wild, how confident can the organization be that the on-board diagnostics will really perform as expected? As it turns out, we can learn from history. In the 1960s and 1970s, the mainframe and telecommunications industries developed powerful statistical methods for answering this exact question for the large mission-critical systems that they were deploying.","1094-6969;10946969","","10.1109/MIM.2016.7524204","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524204","","Diagnostic testing;Intelligent systems;Internet of things;Performance evaluation;Preventive maintenance;Software development","economics;statistical analysis","business performance objectives;failure modes;field performance;historical approaches;on-board diagnostics;statistical methods","","","","","","","","August 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, we focus our research on collecting or monitoring real-time and remote data, which is commonly observed in the health care field of the IoT. In this research, there are difficulties to apply the conventional key distribution approaches during interactions when considering both security and efficiency. Moreover, when preserving personal privacy, anonymity is also important in key distribution processes. We design a system of real-time mobile services and the related security requirements in this paper, and apply a novel and interesting Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (IBKEM) to instantiate our system and achieve anonymous key distribution with only one-pass communication for mobile clients in batch.

Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen.

Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of ""things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we ""acquire"" and ""distribute"" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions. The scheme puts users (including organizational entities) in the center of control over the access to their collections of sensory data.

To date, many such solutions have focused on a single problem domain and require dedicated sensor and actuator infrastructure. This vertical integration makes the development of innovative, novel solutions costly and difficult to deploy. An architectural approach to addressing this challenge is to enable horizontal integration, where sensors and actuators from different applications can interconnect with any computational IoT application. In order to isolate complexities and to support heterogeneous systems and software, it is necessary to provide clear abstractions. We present such abstractions in the form of a layered protocol architecture that describes the necessary interfaces. Beyond technical challenges for horizontal integration, this paper also addresses network economic considerations since the various entities owning and operating sensors and actuators need suitable economic motivation to participate in such an approach.

They promise to offer information about sleep quality of the user by recording a limited number of vital signals, mainly heart rate and body movement. Typically, fitness trackers, smart watches, smart shirts, smartphone applications or patches do not provide access to the raw sensor data. Moreover, the sleep classification algorithm and the agreement ratio with the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG) are not disclosed. Some commercial systems record and store the data on the wearable device, but the user needs to transfer and import it into specialised software applications or return it to the doctor, for clinical evaluation of the data set. Thus an immediate feedback mechanism or the possibility of remote control and supervision are lacking. Furthermore, many such systems only distinguish between sleep and wake states, or between wake, light sleep and deep sleep. It is not always clear how these stages are mapped to the four known sleep stages: REM, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3-4. [1] The goal of this research is to find a reduced complexity method to process a minimum number of bio vital signals, while providing accurate sleep classification results.

The evolution of the information and communication technologies (ICT) or artificial intelligence (AI) allowed the creation of new types of services involving electronic devices with huge potential. The emergence of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) is one of such potential example. Combining the IPA concept with the recent paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT), offers new possibilities and new services to end users, since they could learn more about other entities present in the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a novel mobile gateway solution for a ubiquitous mobile health scenario, in which information gathered from a body sensor network (BSN) is used by an IPA belonging to another person, typically mentioned to as caretaker. The mobile gateway receives real time information related to location, heart rate, and possible falls of the monitored person and acts as a communication channel between the BSN sensors and the IPA platform. Furthermore, the paper presents a performance evaluation study of the proposed mobile IoT-based gateway demonstrating and validating its feasibility.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8325-7; POD:978-1-4673-8326-4","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454517","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454517","Body Sensor Network;Intelligent Personal Assistant;Internet of Things;Mobile Gateway","Biomedical monitoring;Internet;Logic gates;Medical services;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Sensors","Internet of Things;artificial intelligence;biomedical telemetry;body sensor networks;cardiology;medical computing","BSN sensors;IPA platform;Internet of Things mobile gateway services;IoT-based gateway;artificial intelligence;body sensor network;communication technologies;electronic devices;heart rate;information-and-communication technologies;intelligent personal assistants;mobile gateway solution;real time information","","","","26","","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among existing systems, there is none robust system that can act as a bridge between different systems to facilitate knowledge sharing, so as to empower the detection and prediction capabilities of them. These systems cannot use the data and knowledge of other similar systems due to the complexity involved in sharing data between them. Storing the information is also a challenge due to a high volume of sensor data generated by each sensor. The proposed HEAL model is a platform that provides services to developers to leverage the previously processed similar data and the corresponding detected symptoms. The proposed architecture is cloud-based and provides services for input sensors, Internet of Things devices, and context providers. The ultimate goal of the system is to fill the gap between symptoms and diagnosis trend data in order to predict health anomalies accurately and quickly.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8325-7; POD:978-1-4673-8326-4","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454584","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454584","Context-aware;Event Aggregation;Healthcare knowledge sharing;Predict anomalies;Sensor data","Context;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Medical services;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Sensors","geriatrics;health care;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring","HEAL model;ambient assisted living technology;cloud-based services;data generation;detected symptoms;diagnosis trend data;elderly population;healthcare event aggregation lab;healthcare monitoring;knowledge sharing platform;robust system","","","","27","","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The definition and description of virtual sensors have already been presented in our earlier work. This paper presents implementation of virtual sensors at IaaS level. It provides a virtual sensor system architecture for both health and environment sensors and describes virtual sensor operations in four different stages.

So it is imperative to constantly track what is ingested into the body and its impact on a person's health. The Smart Dietary Monitoring System (SDMS) is essentially a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that provides real time dietary scheduling information. The proposed system can track the user's dietary intake and replenish behavior through sensors. By integrating this WSN into the ""Internet of Things"", data can be aggregated in the cloud and analyzed using statistical methods which provide the correlation between the user's health and his dietary regime. This health data can be used to track as well as guide the user regarding his nutritional needs thus acting as an ideal health assistant.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9692-9; POD:978-1-4673-9693-6","10.1109/iNIS.2015.20","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7434426","Dietary Scheduling;Internet of Things;Wireless Sensor networks","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Sensors;Standards;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","Internet;Internet of Things;health care;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;SDMS;WSN;ideal health assistant;real time dietary scheduling information;smart dietary monitoring system;wireless sensor network","","","","11","","","","21-23 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. But it's still not implemented for the broad scope of Hospitals, and especially in Pakistan it's not being used for any purpose in health sector. So we need to define and provide IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS). In this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems.

To realize the full potential of these services, fragmented and heterogeneous data that is generated by different segments of the system need to be consolidated in order to support high-quality processes. This paper proposes a tiered data integration scheme for mHealth systems that works on the schema, entity, and event levels. The proposed scheme incorporates an algorithm that merges and ranks sensor streams for schema integration and event identification, and performs contextual record registration and deduplication for entity resolution. We tested the proposed integration scheme on two sets of sensor-based mHealth data related to human activity recognition. Preliminary results show that the proposed integration scheme contributes to enhancements in event identification precision compared to the classification performance of separate datasets produced within the same mHealth system.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5952-5; POD:978-1-4799-5953-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417815","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417815","","Context;Couplings;Data integration;Elasticity;Medical services;Mobile communication;Monitoring","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;data communication;mobile radio;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT;deduplication;event identification precision;human activity recognition;intelligent health monitoring;mHealth systems;mobile health systems;record registration;sensor streams;sensor-based mHealth data;tiered data integration","","","","15","","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a combined Cloud-Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provides scalable on-demand data storage and resilient computation power at the cloud side as well as anytime, anywhere health data monitoring at the IoT side. As both the privacy of personal medical data and flexible data access should be provided, the data in the Cloud are always encrypted and access control must be operated upon encrypted data together with being fine-grained to support diverse accessibility. Since a plain combination of encryption before access control is not robust and flexible, we propose a scheme with tailored design.

However, footballers face serious injuries during the match and even during training. Concussion, hypoglycemia, swallowing the tongue and shortness of breath are examples of the health problems footballers face, and in extreme cases, may lead to death. In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health. This paper proposes an IoT-based architecture for the sport of football, called IoT Football. Our proposal aims to embed sensing devices (e.g. sensors and RFID), telecommunication technologies (e.g. ZigBee) and cloud computing in the sport of football in order monitor the health of footballers and reduce the occurrence of adverse health conditions.

As critical infrastructures and the Internet of Things begin to integrate into much wider networks, their reliance upon communication assets by third parties to ensure collaboration and control of their systems will significantly increase, along with system complexity and the requirement for improved security metrics. We present a critical analysis of the risk assessment methods developed for generating attack graphs. The failings of these existing schemas include the inability to accurately identify the relationships and interdependencies between the risks and the reduction of attack graph size and generation complexity. Many existing methods also fail due to the heavy reliance upon the input, identification of vulnerabilities, and analysis of results by human intervention.

The main idea of this framework is the integration of physical objects into a global information network. The vision of the IoT is to integrate and connect anything at any time and any place. For this reason, it is being applied in various areas such as power system monitoring, environment monitoring, network control system, smart health care, military, smart cities management and industry revolution. To achieve the goals, the fifth generation (5G) technology will be the potential infrastructure that will assist the visions of the IoT. This paper proposes a distributed approach for microgrid state estimation. First of all, the modelling of a microgrid is presented. The microgrid state-space model is linearized around the operating point, so that the proposed distributed state estimation using the IoT with 5G networks can be applied.

Standard communication protocols facilitate interconnectivity between software components and assure interoperability between different stakeholders of these components. For electric grids, standards introduce an open Smart Grid for liberalized service-oriented electricity markets by smoothing the way for business interactions and trades. Many organizations such as IEC and IEEE are introducing their standard communication protocols for future smart power grids and their associated smart meters. These standards include but not limited to, IEEE 802, IEEE 1815, IEEE 1901, IEC 62056, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, etc. For smart buildings, smart homes and some wireless sensor networks (WSN), ZigBee is widely used. For smart roads, Internet of Things (IoT) is used in some cases including its messaging protocol Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP) together with WSN. In this paper, open source software (OSS) implementation of such standard protocols is discussed, including obstacles and advantages of a such implementation. Moreover, wireless telecommunication infrastructures including Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth are investigated for the right choice of Smart City applications' infrastructure, since the employment of a standard should be compatible with the field of application, timing requirements and data transmission rate.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7465-1; POD:978-1-4673-7466-8","10.1109/OSSCOM.2015.7372690","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372690","IEC standards;IEEE standards;IoT;Open Source Software;Smart City;Smart Grid;Smart Transportation","IEC Standards;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Protocols;Smart cities;Smart grids;Transportation","Bluetooth;IEC standards;IEEE standards;Internet of Things;Zigbee;intelligent transportation systems;open systems;power engineering computing;power markets;protocols;public domain software;service-oriented architecture;smart cities;smart meters;smart power grids;wireless sensor networks","CoAP;IEC standard communication protocols;IEEE standard communication protocols;Internet of Things;IoT;OSS;WSN;Wi-Fi;ZigBee;constraint application protocol;data transmission rate;electric grids;interoperability;liberalized service-oriented electricity markets;open smart grid;open source software;smart city application infrastructure;smart city protocols;smart meters;smart power grids;smart roads;software components;wireless sensor networks;wireless telecommunication infrastructures","","2","","25","","","","10-13 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation. Also, the demand on high security increases difficulties of designing reliable platform for integrating and managing multi-resource life-logging health data. This paper investigates the possibility of collecting and aggregating life-logging data with the use of wearable devices, mobile apps and social media. It compares existing personal health data collection solutions and identifies essential needs of designing a life-logging data aggregator in the IoT environments. An integrated data collection solution with high secure standard is proposed and deployed on a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare platform: MHA [15] by integrating five life-logging resources: Fitbit, Moves, Facbook, Twitter, etc. The preliminary experiment demonstrates that it successfully record, store and reuse the unified and structured personal health information in a long term, including activities, location, exercise, sleep, food, heat rate and mood.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.342","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363388","interdisciplinary;internet of things;life-logging data;wearable computing","Biomedical monitoring;Data collection;Facebook;Media;Medical services;Mobile communication;Twitter","Internet of Things;data aggregation;data integration;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;social networking (online)","Facbook;Fitbit;Internet of Things;IoT environments;Moves;Twitter;heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation;interdisciplinary healthcare collaboration;interdisciplinary healthcare research;life-logging personal health data;long-term health data collection;mobile apps;multiresource life-logging health data integration;multiresource life-logging health data management;personal health data collection solutions;social media;wearable devices","","6","","29","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism.

As we make these small autonomous devices intelligent, it is critical that we also give them a very advanced ability to assess and report their own health. Of course, on-board diagnostics are not a new concept. What is new with the Internet of Things is the extreme economic leverage that the on-board diagnostics will have due to the huge number of devices to be developed. If the on-board diagnostics perform poorly, the resulting surge of support costs could be enough to drive the organization deploying the Internet of Things systems out of business. As an organization gets ready to release millions of a certain type of Internet of Things device into the wild, how confident can the organization be that the on-board diagnostics will really perform as expected? As it turns out, we can learn from history. In the 1960s and 1970s the mainframe and telecommunications industries developed powerful statistical methods for answering this exact question for the large mission-critical systems that they were deploying. This paper will review these historical approaches and show how they can be practically applied to a wide variety of diagnostic systems.

Recent developments in nanotechnology are giving rise to the Internet of Nano-Things, with a new set of finegrained and highly sophisticated healthcare applications that can be run inside the human body. In this paper, we outline a vision of the ubiquitous healthcare ecosystem and its architectural requirements in order to incorporate nanonetworks. We identify some of the envisioned IoNT healthcare applications and the IoNT requirements that are necessary to support the different application categories, as well as the underlying healthcare service opportunities. In order to understand the current status of implementation, we provide a brief analysis of the major efforts targeted at IoNT performance analysis and evaluation.

Medication intake is one of the cases where adherence may be difficult for the patients, who are willing to undertake the prescribed therapy. Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure for activity monitoring is a strong candidate solution to maintain adherence of forgetful patients. In this study, we propose an IoT framework where medication intake is ensured with real time continuous activity recognition. We present our use case with the focus of application and network layers. We utilize an activity classification scheme, which considers inter-activity detection consistency based on non-predefined feature extraction as the application layer. The network layer includes a gateway structure ensuring end-to-end reliability in the connection between a wireless sensor network (WSN) and Internet. Results obtained in simulation environment suggest that the selected application and network layers introduce a feasible solution for the medication intake use case.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7701-0; POD:978-1-4673-7702-7","10.1109/WiMOB.2015.7347966","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347966","Internet of Things;activity recognition;gateway;medical adherence;medication intake","Biomedical monitoring;Logic gates;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Smart phones;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;biomedical communication;computer network reliability;feature extraction;health care;image classification;internetworking;medical computing;object detection;object recognition;patient treatment;wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet-of-things;IoT framework;activity classification scheme;application layers;end-to-end reliability;gateway structure;health care services;interactivity detection consistency;medication intake adherence;network layers;non- predefined feature extraction;prescribed therapy;real time continuous activity recognition;wireless sensor network","","3","","25","","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distributed sensor nodes consist of a local controller (Raspberry-Pi board), to pre-process and format data collected from several sensors, and an Ethernet and power management circuit, to interface with PoE-enabled Ethernet ports. The system design follows a client-server architecture: by combining PoE with the IoT, the endpoint clients and servers (PoE controller modules) can communicate in local area network using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Clients can send commands to observe sensor data, change data acquisition sampling rate, and post new sensor resources. As data gets observed by clients, it can be further stored in a custom-designed HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) file format, for post-processing, visualization and data management. The convergence of data and power flow control enables a smart power management at the network level - most of the sensor nodes will be powered-up (awoken) only after custom triggering events detected by a main subset of always-on sensing nodes. These PoE controller modules are intended for structural and environment monitoring in one of the tallest wooden tower in the world, to be built in UBC campus. The generic architecture may be further adopted in the future for other types of applications, like environmental monitoring or human health.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6908-1; POD:978-1-4799-6909-8","10.1109/IEMCON.2015.7344442","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344442","HDF5;Power-over-Ethernet;Raspberry Pi;Sensor Network;Smart Power Management","Computers;Control systems;Copper;Data visualization;Metadata;Protocols;Servers","Internet of Things;client-server systems;data acquisition;load flow control;local area networks;microcomputers;power aware computing;protocols;wireless sensor networks","CoAP;HDF5 file format;Internet-of-things concept;IoT;PoE-enabled Ethernet ports;Raspberry-Pi board;UBC campus;always-on sensing nodes;client-server architecture;constrained application protocol;data acquisition sampling rate;data flow control;distributed sensor nodes;generic sensor network architecture;hierarchical data format 5 file format;local area network;local controller;network level;post new sensor resources;power flow control;power management circuit;power-over-Ethernet concept;smart power management","","5","","21","","","","15-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such Industrial WSN may exhibit various shapes for different kind of applications. It can indeed be used for Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) to survey bridges, railways, avionic or automotive structures, rotating machine maintenance prediction, it can also serve security purposes like fire forest detection, border security, etc. In this paper we presents the architecture of a miniaturized and low-frequency piezoelectric-based vibrational-energy harvesting device (PEH) and its advanced manufacturing process flow. This harvesting technique uses direct piezoelectric effect to transform mechanical vibrations into electrical power. Over the past decade, several MEMS architectures have been built and assessed to harvest such low frequency (50-75Hz) vibrations. MEMS based PEH use thin (<;5μm) and thick (<;50μm) piezoelectric films allowing a high degree of integration and miniaturization, but at low frequencies the amount of harvested energy is not enough to power sensing electronics which typically consumes 100μW in average during 200ms. To overcome this limitation, we have developed and optimized a thinning process that enable us to use ultra-thin bulk PZT material (<;20μm) and propose a performant and miniaturized PEH.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8182-3; POD:978-1-4799-8183-0","10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0534","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7329394","NDT;energy harvesting;piezoelectric","Computer architecture;Energy harvesting;Frequency measurement;Micromechanical devices;Performance evaluation;Power generation;Vibrations","energy harvesting;micromechanical devices;nondestructive testing;piezoelectric devices;piezoelectric thin films;vibrations;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;MEMS;NDT applications;advanced manufacturing process flow;autonomous wireless sensors;direct piezoelectric effect;electrical power;frequency 50 Hz to 75 Hz;mechanical vibrations;miniaturized piezoelectric based energy harvesting devices;piezoelectric films;power 100 muW;power sensing electronics;thinning process;wireless sensor network","","1","","4","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Integration is often static and limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute- and storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart devices, like smart TVs or smart phones.

One of the things that has a lot of potential is the lighting equipment since it is widely used in our daily life. Recently, the technology of visible light communication (VLC) has been widely discussed. VLC has several advantages, such as freedom of license, line-of-sight security, and less health concern compared with radio-based systems. In addition, the rapid progress of light emitting diode (LED) technology by solid-state lighting allows VLC to be easily deployed and integrated with the existing lighting infrastructure at low costs. However, VLC, when integrated with lighting infrastructure, is usually for one-way communication and is highly sensitive to external interfering light. Thus, transmitting or broadcasting multiple messages simultaneously over a visible light channel without any preprocessing may result in serious collisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle these problems by optical code division multiple access (CDMA) for VLC. With our approach, a VLC receiver can enter an environment without any prior configuration and can be designed with simple hardware. Even a mobile device with a high-resolution photodiode sensor can be used as a receiver. We demonstrate an application of indoor positioning by querying the location service provider on the Internet with the IDs decoded from the received light signals. The prototyping results reveal some communication properties of CDMA-based VLC and its potential for indoor positioning applications.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2463684","Academia Sinica AS-102-TP-A06; D-Link; Industrial Technology Research Institute; Ministry of Education Aiming for the Top University and Elite Research Center Development Plan; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), National Taiwan University, and Intel; 10.13039/100002465 - Delta; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7174962","Broadcast;CDMA;IEEE 802.15.7;broadcast;localization;pervasive computing;visible light communication","Brightness;Broadcasting;Lighting;Multiaccess communication;Optical sensors;Optical transmitters;Receivers","LED lamps;broadcast communication;code division multiple access;indoor navigation;lighting;mobile communication;optical links","CDMA based visible light communications;high resolution photodiode sensor;indoor positioning application;light emitting diode;lighting infrastructure;mobile device;optical code division multiple access;simultaneous message broadcasting;solid state lighting","","9","","30","","","20150803","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a two-stage concept where a novel low-power carbon nanotube is used as a gas detector for an energy-consuming metal-oxide (MOX) semiconductor gas sensor. We propose a design of a heterogeneous sensor node where we exploit the low-power nanotube gas sensor and the more accurate MOX sensor. This work performs energy consumption simulations for three event-driven scenarios to evaluate the power consumption reduction, as well as the limitations of carbon nanotubes. Our results show the benefits of the proposed approach over the scenarios with adaptive duty-cycling with only MOX gas sensors, proved with 20%-35% node lifetime prolongation. The delay introduced due to the nanotube recovery time can be overcome by radio duty-cycled activity for detecting alarm messages from the neighbour nodes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8981-2; POD:978-1-4799-8982-9","10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184980","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184980","","Carbon nanotubes;Energy consumption;Gas detectors;Heating;Monitoring;Power demand","Internet of Things;carbon nanotubes;computerised instrumentation;gas sensors;low-power electronics;nanosensors;semiconductor counters","C;Internet of Things;MOX semiconductor gas sensor;air pollution;air quality monitoring;alarm message detection;energy consumption simulation;event-driven low-power nanotube gas sensor;heterogeneous sensor node;low power carbon nanotube;metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensor;node lifetime prolongation;power management;power-hungry energy-efficient design","","2","","29","","","","18-19 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In summary, TLSensing is composed by a number of constrained devices equipped with sensing and wireless communication capabilities, a central system coordinator that controls data acquisition processes through a dedicated monitoring software, and a web server application that collects data coming from the network and makes them available to the user and to external software entities belonging to the health management system.

Similarly Smart home users subscribe to a Smart home cloud service that will use data from home sensors.

We address this problem by modelling the network as a tree with interfering links corresponding to the number of devices. We propose a network partitioning approach to reduce these interfering links by extending the tree to a second level. The first level interfering links correspond to optimizing the frame duration where as the second level interfering links correspond to improving the slot utilization. We show that forming this two-level tree is an NP-complete problem by formulating it as a conflict graph. We then propose two polynomial-time algorithms to address offline and online slot allocation requests that resolve these conflicts efficiently by introducing the so called virtual interference links.

The most crucial role of the bee is pollination; the value of pollination dependant crops is estimated at € 155 billion per year with honey bees identified as the most important pollinator insect. It is clear that honey bees are a vitally important part of the environment which cannot be allowed to fall into decline. The project outlined in this paper uses Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology to monitor a beehive colony and collect key information about activity/environment within a beehive as well as its surrounding area. This project uses low power WSN technologies, including novel sensing techniques, energy neutral operation, and multi-radio communications; together with cloud computing to monitor the behaviour within a beehive. The insights gained through this activity could reduce long term costs and improve the yield of beekeeping, as well as providing new scientific evidence for a range of honey bee health issues. WSN is an emerging modern technology, key to the novel concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). Comprised of embedded sensing, computing and wireless communication devices, they have found applications in nearly every aspect of daily life. Informed by biologists' hypotheses, this work used existing, commercially available WSN platforms together with custom built systems in an innovative application to monitor honey bee health and activity in order to better understand how to remotly monitor the health and behaviour of the bees. Heterogeneous sensors were deployed, monitoring the honey bees in the hive (temperature, CO2, pollutants etc.). Weather conditions throughout the deployment were recorded and a relationship between the hive conditions and external conditions was observed. A full solution is presented including a smart hive, communication, and data aggregation and visualisation tools. Future work will focus on improving the ener- y performance of the system, introducing a more specialised set of sensors, implementing a machine learning algorithm to extract meaning from the data without human supervision; and securing additional deployments of the system.","1091-5281;10915281","Electronic:978-1-4799-6114-6; POD:978-1-4799-6115-3; USB:978-1-4799-6113-9","10.1109/I2MTC.2015.7151292","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7151292","3G mobile communication;Embedded systems;Wireless Sensor Networks;Zigbee;energy harvesting","Agriculture;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cloud computing;intelligent sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;beehive colony monitoring;cloud computing;embedded sensing;energy neutral operation;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;hive conditions;low power WSN technologies;machine learning algorithm;multiradio communications;pollination dependant crops;weather conditions","","5","","13","","","","11-14 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Expanding the boundaries of test and diagnostics: Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) for complex systems","D. Goodman","Ridgetop Group, Inc., US","2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","20150702","2015","","","1","1","Prognostics, or predictive diagnostics, offers substantial promise to reduce the life-cycle costs of critical systems. When linked with comprehensive Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) or Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) architectures, prognostics offers significant benefits. Applications range from aerospace to industrial machines on the factory floor. These systems include electronic and mechanical components that are subject to wear-out and eventual failure. Standard test and diagnostics can serve to confirm the quality of the manufactured device or system at time zero but also can be used to monitor the health of the part throughout its lifetime. This is done by linking diagnostics with parameter extraction to determine on-going state-of-health (SoH). Algorithms can analyze the SoH to determine the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as well. Key benefits are that prognostics enable impending failures to be found before they occur, with improvements to safety and serviceability, along with life cycle cost reduction. On-line tests or periodic tests during the components'/systems' lifetime or burn-in tests and diagnosis serve to provide useful input data for the prognostic process. The historical basis for prognostics began with vibration monitoring of mechanical systems. It was found that unique signatures could be detected, extracted, and then correlated with wear on bearings or gears. These unique signatures, in turn, could be used to build fault dictionaries, to alert service personnel and trigger a host of autonomic logistical actions. In recent years, PHM has expanded to the electronics world, where users have raised concern about the robustness of systems when the key components such as ICs may have reduced lifetimes. While conventional mean-time-between-failures (MTBF)-type reliability estimates offer some initial measure of statistical lifetime, the individual system's lifetime is affected by its actual use environment, possible “Black- Swan” events, or damage while in service. The basic process of prognostics involves an orderly sequence of steps ; - Sensing and observability : - Anomaly Detection : - Cross reference against a fault dictionary : - Algorithmic processing of data : - State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) calculations. As with any process or method, the business case has to be examined involving Return on Investment (ROI). Often the ROI calculations transcend organizational boundaries. Some of the early findings have been very encouraging on life-cycle cost reductions.

The challenges of delivering these new services on a cloud-based architecture are not only on the technical side, they also concern the definition of feasible business models for all the involved agents and the definition and negotiation of proper service level agreements at different levels. This work proposes to provide telecommunication operators with cloud-based infrastructures capable of offering customers innovative and reliable rich communication services based on their phone numbers that cannot be replicated by the Internet competitors in terms of flexibility, scalability or security. This Obliquity as a Service model (MaaS) allows telecommunication providers to maintain relevance for their clients offering not only the common communication services (instant messaging, group communication and chat, file sharing or enriched calls services) but also a new kind of mobiquiotus services related to mobile marketing, smart places, Internet of Things or health care, exploiting all the competitive advantages associated to the development of a vertical cloud in a dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem. In addition, the infrastructure layer needed to support the new proposed model is defined and a first prototype is deployed and evaluated with two real use cases.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8977-5; POD:978-1-4799-8978-2","10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.13","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7130889","Mobile Cloud Computing;Mobiquity;Rich Communication Services;Telecommunication Vertical Cloud","Big data;Biological system modeling;Business;Cities and towns;Cloud computing;Mobile communication","cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication computing","MaaS;cloud-based infrastructures;communication services;mobile cloud computing;mobiquity as a service model;telecommunication vertical clouds","","0","","22","","","","March 30 2015-April 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The properties of recently studied nanomaterials, such as graphene, have inspired the concept of Internet of NanoThings (IoNT), based on the interconnection of nanoscale devices. Despite being an enabler for many applications, the artificial nature of IoNT devices can be detrimental where the deployment of NanoThings could result in unwanted effects on health or pollution. The novel paradigm of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is introduced in this paper by stemming from synthetic biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of biological embedded computing devices. Based on biological cells, and their functionalities in the biochemical domain, Bio-NanoThings promise to enable applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation networks, and environmental control of toxic agents and pollution.

In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5967-9; POD:978-1-4799-5968-6","10.1109/iThings.2014.16","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059641","artifical neural network;hypertension prediction;logistic regression","Analytical models;Artificial neural networks;Diseases;Hypertension;Logistics;Predictive models;Regression analysis","backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis","ANN;AUC;BP algorithm;BRFSS;Internet of Things;IoT technology;MLP neural network model;area under the receiver-operator curve;artificial neural network-based approach;back propagation;behavior risk factor surveillance system;binary logistic regression model;cardiovascular diseases;chronic disease prediction model;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;healthcare technology;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;multilayer perception neural network model;population aging;quality of life improvement","","2","","30","","","","1-3 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Community health stations do not have enough doctors to take care of their patients in traditional ways. In order to establish a bridge between doctors and patients, we propose eBPlatform, which is an information system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for homecare of the NCD patients. The eBox is a sensor which can be deployed in the patient's home for blood pressure measurement, blood sugar measurement and ECG signals collection. Some services are running on the remote server, which can receive the samples, filter and analyze the ECG signals.

With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.","","Electronic:978-1-63190-043-3; POD:978-1-4799-5328-8","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257621","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014600","30 day readmission;Cloud;Collaboration;Internet of things;M2M;Management;Policy;Predictive Analytics;Sensors;e-health","Context;Electronic mail;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Sensors;Wide area networks","Internet of Things;cloud computing;hospitals;medical computing;patient care;risk analysis","30 day readmission protection program;Internet of things;US healthcare affordable care act;care quality;compromised data;data availability;data unavailability;e-health architecture;healthcare outcomes;hospitals;loT enabled cloud based e-health;post discharge;post discharge care;proactive care;readmission avoidance efforts;reduced payment penalties;risk patterns","","0","","12","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"DCCA: Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment for improved 802.11/802.15.4 coexistence","A. King; J. Brown; U. Roedig","School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, United Kingdom","2014 IEEE 10th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","20141124","2014","","","45","50","The interaction between devices sharing the same frequency domain, but using different communication protocols, is an important issue prevalent to the Internet of Things (IoT). IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, protocols that overlap in applications such as home automation, health care and factory automation, is one such example. In these situations 802.11 networks are known to detrimentally interfere with 802.15.4 networks, degrading performance significantly. We show that the response to unsuccessful Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) is a large contributor to this degradation. Current responses do not distinguish between different transmission sources, employing the same response independent of the interferer type. However, as we show in this paper, it is beneficial to discriminate interferer types when performing CCA as this allows us to employ different strategies in handling occupied media. Our work considers in particular the low-power Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on the 802.15.4 standard. In such protocols, CCA is applied at the transmitter to arbitrate channel access, and also at the receiver for power efficient transmission detection. We present a protocol building block called Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (DCCA) which allows us to tailor the reaction to a busy channel depending on the nature of the interfering network type. We evaluate an implementation of DCCA for the ContikiMAC protocol on the Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP platform. The experimental evaluation shows that DCCA improves throughput of 802.15.4 networks in the presence of 802.11 networks significantly, ten-fold in some settings.","2160-4886;21604886","Electronic:978-1-4799-5041-6; POD:978-1-4799-5042-3; USB:978-1-4799-5040-9","10.1109/WiMOB.2014.6962148","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6962148","802.15.4;CCA;WiFi;Wireless Sensor Networks","IEEE 802.11 Standards;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Interference;Media Access Protocol;Receivers;Transceivers","Internet of Things;Zigbee;access protocols;radio receivers;radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;wireless LAN;wireless channels","CCA;ContikiMAC protocol;DCCA;IEEE 802.11 networks;IEEE 802.15.4, networks;Internet of Things;IoT;Maxfor MTM- CM5000MSP platform;communication protocols;differentiating clear channel assessment;frequency domain;interfering network;low-power medium access control;power efficient transmission detection;protocol building block;receiver;transmitter","","1","","9","","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior research had employed the event study method to examine the short term market reaction of RFID adoption and found significant positive abnormal return. But whether RFID adoption can payback in the long run has not been addressed. In this paper, we extend previous research by using the ROA (Return on Assets) method to analyze the impact of RFID adoption on firm market value. We selected 74 publicly traded companies which were RFID adopters and there are altogether 108 adoption announcements ranging from 1997 to 2009. Then Pair T test of ROA had been conducted for each publicly traded company and its matching company. Other potential confounding factors are also considered such as the type of industry, timing of adoption, country, and firm characteristics such as level of diversification, financial health and growth potential. Altogether, there is no significant difference between RFID adopters and RFID non-adopters. Our result indicates that RFID's firm value has not been fully reflected in the long run. This may be attributed to its high cost and other uncertainties.

In order to tackle that goal, a first step must be to accurately estimate such exposure, even in large areas, and with real operating networks. This paper introduces the work that is being carried out to deploy a number of low-complexity dosimeters to characterize the EMF at four different bands. The devices exploit the facilities provided by a wireless sensor network testbed, and are therefore integrated as another IoT (Internet of Things) node.

The project targets the process chain from designer and clothing manufacturer to retailer and end-user customers. The VDR has been subject of other publications, thus is introduced only briefly in this manuscript. VDR is a `non-groupware-based' project funded under the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation. A main goal at conception was reducing returns of online purchased apparel, which, at a reported approximately 40% is crippling the clothing industry. Results from public response surveys (including at The Scandinavian Health & Rehab Messe) to a VDR simulation system clearly indicated how the wheelchair-bound community perceived benefits from the system. This was unexpected and aside from the original VDR project design requisite. Interviews highlighted problems of high street fitting rooms not being sized to accommodate wheelchairs, and often so minimally sized as to not enable a second helping person to be present to support the involved undressing and dressing procedures. Existing online purchasing systems were also considered problematic including a need to improve social networking to enable others Online to view clothes considered for purchase to assist decision making. The production suffered problematic cooperation, coordination, communication, and collaboration that prevented early product. This resulted in additional surveys and the evolution of this additional work-in-progress. Following introducing the VDR, key issues such as interface design, body measurement, and cloth representation in the VDR is discussed. The finding of wheelchair-bound-need is envisioned as a next-generation iteration and is thus the focus of this contribution to position the work-in-progress and invite like-minded interested parties to collaborate to- ards optimization of a system to realize potentials.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5156-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-5158-1; POD:978-1-4799-5159-8","10.1109/CTS.2014.6867629","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6867629","Collaborative System Generation;Cooperation;HCI;Human Computer Confluence;Virtual Environment;collaboration;communication;coordination","Avatars;Cameras;Clothing;Companies;Industries;Interviews;Market research","Internet of Things;retail data processing;virtual reality","Internet of Things;VDR simulation system;clothing industry;inclusive virtual dressing room;online purchased apparel;wheelchair-bound customers","","0","","39","","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.","2168-2194;21682194","Electronic:978-1-4799-2131-7; POD:978-1-4799-2132-4","10.1109/BHI.2014.6864307","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6864307","","Authorization;Cloud computing;Filtering;Medical services;Ontologies;Semantics","authorisation;electronic health records;granular computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","IOT;Internet of things;RABAC;attribute-based access control;cloud computing;data access;granular security concepts;granularity levels;health care providers;health information collection;health information transmission;healthcare information systems;healthcare professional component;information storage;local security policies;medical device component;nonhealthcare component;nonhealthcare providers;ontology;patient data;patient-centered model;patient-specified authorization policies;personal health record;role-based access control;semantic matching;semantic rule reasoning;social care providers;social information collection;virtual PHR authorization system","","1","","16","","","","1-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The implementation of a smart objects-oriented IoT is a complex challenge as distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions and granularity need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. In this paper, we propose the integration of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: Agents and Cloud. Agent-based computing can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems. Cloud computing can enhance the IoT objects with high performance computing capabilities and huge storage resources.

A critical issue in M2M communications is the energy efficiency as typically the machine devices are powered by batteries of low capacity and thus, it is the key to optimize their consumption. To achieve higher energy efficiency, this paper proposes the adoption of contexts through a generic context-aware framework for M2M communications. With this framework, machine devices dynamically adapt their settings depending on a series of characteristics such as data reporting mode, QoS features, and network conditions to achieve higher energy efficiency and extend the operating lifetime of M2M networks. Simulation results are provided for four commonly used M2M applications. The results demonstrate considerable energy savings and operating lifetime extension on the network when the proposed context-aware framework is used. Thus, it is shown that contexts play an important role on the energy efficiency of M2M systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3088-3; POD:978-1-4799-3089-0","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849321","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849321","Context-Awareness;Energy Efficiency;Internet of Things;M2M;MTC","Conferences;Context;Energy consumption;Machine-to-machine communications;Magnetic heads;Quality of service;Servers","Internet of Things;cellular radio;optimisation;quality of service;telecommunication power management","Internet of things;M2M communications;QoS features;cellular network;context-awareness;data reporting mode;energy efficiency;machine-to-machine communications","","4","","18","","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A photo album, an appointment calendar, a telephone bill, a health record are all resource examples, listed here in the increasing order of expected privacy protection. A few properties of these resources define the roles of three major actors: The resources belong to their owner, they are hosted by the service provider, and they increasingly need to be shared (say, to support mash-up) with consumers. Owners authorize consumers' access to their resources, which providers then grant to the consumers upon authenticating them and checking for proper authorization. In the past, this was achieved by maintaining an access control list for each resource at the service provider. Typically, such a list specifies all consumers along with their privileges. Emerging trends in social networking and cloud computing require elasticity, or, in other words, the ability to grant resource access to new consumers on the fly. Naturally, this comes with ever-increasing requirements for privacy, which dictate strong authentication of all actors involved as well as cryptographic protection of the involved communication sessions. We share the industry expectation that the technology that solves the above problem will be a major enabler for applications based on technologies that range from social networking, to video-on-demand, to health care, to smart metering, and—especially—to cloud computing. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies, including the emerging Open Authorization Protocol (OAuth) 2.0, and presents our own solution in this space, which removes an intermediary and gives the owner of a resource immediate control over defining access to that resource.","1089-7089;10897089","","10.1002/bltj.20511","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6770163","","","","","","4","4","","","","","Sept. 2011","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

However, these emission tests are usually cost-ineffective and time-consuming. It is also difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new vehicle emission inspection and notification system to help daily monitoring of engine health through the concept of Internet of Things. As there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area, they are employed to play an important role in the proposed system. By the fact that every car must stop in front of red lights, reliable reading of air ratio (λ) from a vehicle, which indicates the engine emission status, can be interrogated wirelessly through mature and low-price radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. By inspecting the λ in real time, the vehicle emissions can be effectively controlled by the governmental authorities.

The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations.

This brings forward the challenges of converting or mapping formerly isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to be IP compatible. IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is one of the first protocols which provide IP compatibility to low data rate WSNs. While 6LoWPAN is efficient for WSNs, there are other limitations such as different physical layers and radio interfaces which will break the information flow between heterogeneous IP-compatible networks and the Internet. In this paper, an integrated hardware/software solution is presented to bridge two heterogeneous 6LoWPAN networks. It is motivated by the necessity of merging a body area network and an environment control network in typical health monitoring applications of an intelligent environment. The unification is achieved through use of a physical serial bus, making a single hybrid router with the capability to route packets across both networks. The commonalities between two 6LoWPAN implementations allow highly efficient packet translation between two network stacks. Internet connectivity was added though use of an edge router, and allows each node to be addressed and accessed directly from anywhere on the Internet.","2156-8065;21568065","Electronic:978-1-4673-5222-2; POD:978-1-4673-5221-5","10.1109/ICSensT.2013.6727751","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727751","6LoWPAN;body area networks;health monitoring;intelligent environments;wireless sensor networks","Hardware;Internet;Protocols;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;biomedical communication;body area networks;computerised monitoring;embedded systems;patient monitoring;personal area networks;routing protocols","IP addressable;IPv6;Internet of Things application;WSN;body area network;environment control network;health monitoring application;integrating heterogeneous embedded 6LoWPAN network;low power wireless personal area network;physical serial bus;protocol;single hybrid route packet translation;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor network","","5","","18","","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Efficient utilization of the IoT for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication requires security. The IETF 6L0WPAN standard provides the mechanism for IPv6 packet transmission over low-power wireless personal area networks. Thus, the interconnection of wireless sensor devices to the Internet facilitates the M2M communication with many application areas such as smart grid, metering, health, environment, vehicle and home appliances. M2M communication over the 6L0WPAN has security challenges as a result of the greater number of 61owpan devices, smaller packet transmission, low power, low processing and various application areas. In order to secure the subsequent M2M communication over the 6L0WPAN, secure authentication and session key exchange schemes among the communicating parties are needed. Therefore, in this paper we propose SAKES - a secure authentication and key establishment scheme - for the M2M communication in the 6L0WPAN. The security analysis is done for different attack scenarios. The impact of DoS attack in the performance of the 6L0WPAN is evaluated. The evaluation is carried out by using OPNET simulation tool.

Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most ""primitive"" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning.

For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2277656","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6576185","6LoWPAN;CoAP;CoAPs;DTLS;IoT;security","Encoding;Internet;Payloads;Protocols;Security;Sensors;Standards","Internet of Things;operating systems (computers);personal area networks;protocols;security of data","6LoWPAN standard;Contiki operating system;DTLS;Internet of Things;IoT;Lithe;authenticated confidential communication;constrained application protocol;datagram transport layer security;e-health domain;end-to-end security;lightweight secure CoAP;resource-constrained devices","","95","1","26","","","20130807","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem.

Firstly, the requirements of human centric web of things application are described. Then the active linked data with data, task, context, computational organization, knowledge, presentation and interaction models is defined by extending the conventional linked data. Based on the active linked data models, we propose a semantic Web of Things framework, which leverages multiagent technologies to facilitate human-to-human and human-to-machine collaborations.

IoT coverage is very wide and include variety of objects like smart phones, tablets, digital cameras, sensors, etc. Once all these devices are connected with each other, they enable more and more smart processes and services that support our basic needs, economies, environment and health. Such enormous number of devices connected to internet provides many kinds of services and produce huge amount of data and information. Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. compute, networks, servers, storage, applications, services, and software) that can be easily provisioned as Infrastructure (IaaS), software and applications (SaaS). Cloud based platforms help to connect to the things (IaaS) around us so that we can access anything at any time and any place in a user friendly manner using customized portals and in built applications (SaaS). Hence, cloud acts as a front end to access Internet of Things. Applications that interact with devices like sensors have special requirements of massive storage to storage big data, huge computation power to enable the real time processing of the data, and high speed network to stream audio or video. In this paper, we describe how Internet of Things and Cloud computing can work together can address the Big Data issues.

To this end, the IETF RoLL working group has designed the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This paper discusses the problems of link quality estimation and neighbor management policies when it comes to handling high densities. We implement and evaluate different neighbor management policies and link probing techniques in Contiki's RPL implementation. We report on our experience with a 100-node testbed with average 40-degree density. We show the sensitivity of high density routing with respect to cache sizes and routing metric initialization.

As a result, traffic congestion occurs, especially in large urban areas. Therefore, in order to avoid traffic jams, immediate solutions have to be found. Various technologies have been used to design and develop such solutions in the past. While some developers have used classic technologies, others have integrated various emerging technologies in the systems they built in order to make roadways safer. Acting both inside the vehicle and along the roadways the new designed systems are able to inform drivers about traffic conditions and possible hazards. This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based approach to solve some of the problems that traffic congestion raises. Furthermore, this approach provides the means to monitor a set of environmental parameters, including air quality, and to raise early warnings and alarms when critical levels are reached. This approach offers a solution to increasing traffic-related pollution (which has a negative impact on the environment and on people's health), to economic losses and to other issues caused by traffic congestions. In order to reduce accident risks when various intervention vehicles enter the cross-roads, we also propose a solution based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1810-5; POD:978-1-4673-1809-9","10.1109/ICATE.2012.6403461","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403461","","Cities and towns;Internet;Monitoring;Radiofrequency identification;Roads;Traffic control;Vehicles","Internet of Things;air pollution measurement;alarm systems;distributed processing;driver information systems;environmental monitoring (geophysics);radiofrequency identification;risk management;road accidents;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles","Internet of Things;RFID technology;accident risk reduction;air quality;alarms;distributed intelligent system;driver information system;early warnings;economic losses;environmental parameter monitoring;radiofrequency identification;road space;self-optimization;traffic conditions;traffic congestion;traffic jam avoidance;traffic volume;traffic-light intersection control;traffic-related pollution;vehicle fleet size","","2","","21","","","","25-27 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which ""things"" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4684-1; POD:978-1-4673-1328-5","10.1109/IMIS.2012.109","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296947","Ambient Intelligent;DomoNet;E-Health;Machine Learning;Ontology;SOA;XML;domotics;home automation","Ambient intelligence;Context;Monitoring;Ontologies;Semantics;Senior citizens","data structures;ecology;embedded systems;emergency services;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Internet of Things;Internet-capable things;ambient intelligence;artificial intelligence techniques;automated home;computational significance;digital traces;distributed environmental context information;domestic environment;e-health system;embedded intelligence;emergency situations;everyday life;health hazards anticipation;human behavior;intelligent ecosystem;intelligent things;interoperability;machine learning;natural abstraction;occupants behaviors;ontology-based IoT domotic environment;semantic Web;semantic knowledge representation;technology-independent manner","","7","","15","","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Web Services technologies responded quickly to help such evolution and in many situations the Web Services application is driving businesses and dictating a new way of doing business. In this paper, we present an ideal model for developing web servers for small organizations by including search engine optimization techniques such as the best set of keywords from the search results of the Top-k Keyword Proximity Organic Searches and from the results of Similar Keyword Searches and Image Searches. We analyze the database of the web services to discover the customers' preferences, demographics, and demand patterns and trends. Also, we discuss the Quality of Services (QoS) of the Web services including the areas of Trust and Reputation, Security, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), and the Reliability and Performance. Our prototypes and studies could be applied to improve the global Search Marketing (SM) of enterprise websites in small organizations in areas of business, health, government, education, library and many others.

Mandatory vehicle examination cannot be taken easily for each car, so it is difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Traffic lights considered as “Things” through the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) can be applied because there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area.

Internet of things (IoT) is one of the last advances in ICT, providing a global connectivity and management of sensors, devices, users and information. Our contribution is a solution to examine drug related problems based on IoT technologies, i.e. smart phones and Web to support ubiquitous Access, 6LoWPAN technology to support ubiquitous data collection of patients, sensors and hospitals, and RFID/NFC to support global identification. These technologies offer a wide range of applications in healthcare, which improves the quality of services, reduce mistakes, and even detect health anomalies from vital signs. This paper presents how IoT technology is applied in a pharmaceutical system to examine drugs in order to detect Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR), harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, complications and contraindications related with liver and renal defects, and harmful side effects during pregnancy or lactation. Thereby, the system provides an enhanced approach assisting physicians in clinical decisions and drug prescribing. The solution presented is based on NFC (Near Field Communication) and barcode identification technologies, which have been integrated in common devices such as smart-phones, PDAs and PCs. The drug ID is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a specific drug is suitable with respect to the patient's health record or not.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7415-8; POD:978-1-4244-7413-4","10.1109/IOT.2010.5678458","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678458","Barcode;Drug Checker;Internet of Things;NFC;Pharmaceutical;RFID","Drugs;Hospitals;Ontologies;Radiofrequency identification;Smart phones","Internet;drugs;health care;personal area networks;ubiquitous computing","6LoWPAN technology;Internet of things;IoT;adverse drugs reaction;barcode identification;communication technology;drugs interaction checker;global connectivity;global identification;healthcare;information technology;near field communication;pharmaceutical system;quality of services;smart phones;ubiquitous access;ubiquitous data collection","","8","1","24","","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paradigm of the IoS indeed offers interesting capabilities in terms of dynamicity and interoperability. However in domains that involve “things” (e.g. appliances), there is still a strong need for loose coupling and a proper separation between types and instances that are well-known in Component-Based approaches but that typical SOA fail to provide.

Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6606-1; POD:978-1-4244-6605-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470547","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470547","Ambient Assisted Living;Barcode;Internet of things;NFC;Ontology;Rule-Based System","Artificial intelligence;Cellular phones;Costs;Drugs;Hospitals;Information systems;Intelligent systems;Internet;Knowledge based systems;Pharmaceuticals","Internet;drug delivery systems;knowledge based systems;medical information systems","Internet-of-things;active ingredients;adverse drugs reaction;allergy interactions;electronic health record;near field communication;nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance;pharmaceutical intelligent information system","","10","","18","","","","March 29 2010-April 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities","","","2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","20171023","2017","","","xi","xiv","In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such valida- ions span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of D<sup>n</sup>y for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4338-5; POD:978-1-5090-4339-2","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917641","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917641","","","Internet of Things;cognition;health care;home computing;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing","Alzheimers patients;Internet of Things;IoT;cognitive health assessment;machine learning techniques;retirement community centers;signal processing;smart home health service systems;technology-guided algorithmic methodology","","","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea of an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is currently captivating both technologists and society at large. Although IoT techniques have their roots in ideas that are decades old, their increasingly widespread deployments have made them a hot topic these days, frequently discussed and hyped. As many as 50B networked devices are envisioned by 2020, and proponents of IoTs see a world where embedded sensing and control techniques help vehicle traffic flow more smoothly, where environmental sensing and data analysis facilitates better use of natural resources like water, and where personalized health monitoring helps individuals improve their quality of life. On the other hand, properly addressing policy concerns around security and privacy may play a role in IoT's adoption and success. My talk will discuss key technology and policy challenges for future IoT applications and devices. Overall, I will be drawing from both technical experiences and trends, as well as from policy perspectives gained during a one year fellowship doing technology policy within the U. S. Department of State.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3508-3; POD:978-1-5090-3509-0","10.1109/MICRO.2016.7783703","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783703","","","Internet of Things;data analysis;intelligent sensors","50B networked devices;Internet of Things;IoT;data analysis;embedded control;embedded sensing;natural resources;vehicle traffic flow","","","","","","","","15-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The best-known example of such an intelligent system is the smart grid. The same technologies that enabled the smart grid are being applied to many other types of physical systems. Intelligent systems are rapidly emerging in transportation, buildings, other energy infrastructures (e.g., gas, oil, and water), manufacturing, emergency response, and health care. Of course, the smart grid provides an essential foundation since all types of intelligent systems depend on reliable and high-quality electricity to power their operation. Various writers use terms such as cyberphysical systems,” “industrial Internet,” and the “Internet of Things (IOT )” to refer to what we are calling “intelligent systems.” While these terms do not necessarily mean the same thing, they all bring to mind a common set of enabling technologies that are making physical systems intelligent.","2325-5897;23255897","","10.1109/MELE.2015.2509904","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7420800","","Industries;Intelligent systems;Productivity;Smart grids;Systems operation;Technological innovation","","","","","","","","","","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities","A. Sheth","Wright State Univ., Dayton, OH, USA","2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","20150108","2014","","","2","3","Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain an- the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5666-1; POD:978-1-4799-5667-8","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004204","","","Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","Big Data;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity;Big Data volume;continuous semantics;domain models;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;metadata;ontologies;personalized digital health;semantic interoperability;semantic perception;smart data;vocabularies","","1","","","","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multi-channel EEG signals as well as a designed sparsifying basis to increase the sparsity of the EEG signal to improve the reconstruction quality, hence, increase the efficiency of the system.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5007-9; POD:978-1-5090-5008-6","10.1109/ICUWB.2017.8251001","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251001","EEG;Internet of things (IoT);compressive sensing (CS);joint sparsity","Brain modeling;Compressed sensing;Electroencephalography;Image coding;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sensors;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks.

By using simple propagation models, an optimal drone-surface distance is mathematically derived at the purpose to maximize the electromagnetic footprint for the specific choice of system parameters, such as the sensor type and position, the reader sensitivity, the ground reflectivity, the radiated power, and the flight velocity. Theoretical achievements and some preliminary experimentations indicate that omnidirectional antennas are preferred for the drone so that 9–12 m footprints could be achieved with state-of-the-art readers and battery-less or battery-assisted RFID sensors, provided that the UAV flights at 3–5 m from the surface to be monitored.

These factors affect vehicle drivers negatively as they contribute to stress, health problems, and wastefulness of time. This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets. A Bayesian Network is generated from the water level sensors and image processing data which provides possible reroute areas to avoid traffic congestion and flooded areas. All data are sent to a cloud platform through the Internet that can be accessed through a mobile user interface. This mobile user application provides information about the condition of the streets and possible reroute maps to users. The accuracy of the system is tested by actual implementation on a specific road. Results showed minimum accessing delay from using the ArRoad to navigate in rerouted paths to prevent impassable roads due to heavy traffic and flood. If effect, it lessens the amount of time experienced by drivers from heavy traffic condition and flooded streets which then improves the quality of life by preventing waste of resources such as time and money.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4045-2; POD:978-1-5090-4046-9","10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229368","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8229368","Bayesian Network;Image processing;Internet of Things;Machine learning;Sensors;Vehicle traffic","Cameras;Image processing;Image sensors;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Roads;Sensors","","","","","","","","","","24-27 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Pervasive Integration Platform of Low-Cost MEMS Sensors and Wireless Signals for Indoor Localization","Y. Zhuang; J. Yang; L. Qi; Y. Li; Y. Cao; N.

With existing infrastructures, wireless positioning is widely used to provide the location service. However, wireless positioning has the limitations such as highly depending on the distribution of access points (APs); providing a low samplerate and noisy solution; requiring extensive labor costs to build databases; and having unstable RSS values in indoor environments. To reduce these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative integrated platform for indoor localization by integrating low-cost MEMS sensors and wireless signals. This proposed platform consists of wireless AP localization engine and sensor fusion engine, which is suitable for both dense and sparse deployments of wireless APs. The proposed platform can automatically generate wireless databases for positioning, and provide a positioning solution even in the area with only one observed wireless AP, where the traditional trilateration method cannot work. This integration platform can integrate different kinds of wireless APs together for indoor localization (e.g., WiFi, BLE, and RFID). The platform fuses all of these wireless distances with low-cost MEMS sensors to provide a robust localization solution. A multi-level quality control mechanism is utilized to remove noisy RSS measurements from wireless APs and to further improve the localization accuracy. Preliminary experiments show the proposed integration platform can achieve the average accuracy of 3.30 m with the sparse deployment of wireless APs (1 AP per 800 m²).","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2785338","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231129","Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE);Indoor localization;Received Signal Strength (RSS);WiFi;inertial navigation system (INS);integration platform;multi-level quality control.","Engines;Micromechanical devices;Sensor fusion;Wireless communication;Wireless fidelity;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20171220","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the “edge”, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920×1080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3×3 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3093-8; POD:978-1-5386-3094-5","10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203873","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203873","","","Internet of Things;cellular neural nets;edge detection;floating point arithmetic;health care;image segmentation;medical image processing;mobile computing;telemedicine","4-8 Giga floating point multiplications;cellular neural network;compressed CeNN framework;compressed cellular neural networks;edge segmentation;high-resolution images;image analysis;image processing;low power mobile computing platforms;medical diagnosis;mobile telemedicine;rapidly aging population;real-time constraints;real-time medical image segmentation;remote health care;segmentation results","","","","","","","","13-16 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some exposure to radiation is acceptable, radiation monitoring should be done to keep the levels of radiation exposure to a minimum. In this paper, we intend to monitor and measure the radiation levels that a specific area is exposed to using a radiation sensor, and to send the data to a cloud from where the values can be accessed by the concerned authorities. In order to meet the objectives we utilize GM counters, which are radiation sensors that detect and measure the amount of radiation present in the radiation environment. The GM counter is interfaced to a NodeMCU to update the detected and measured radiation to a radiation IoT platform that can store and retrieve data across a network. Further, a GPS module is interfaced with the NodeMCU to locate the location data of the radiation emitted from the radiation sources under such radiation environment. The radiation values are remotely monitored in real time through web server configured with the radiation IoT platform to remote monitor the radiation level and mapping the location of such radiations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6367-3; POD:978-1-5090-6368-0; USB:978-1-5090-6366-6","10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8125878","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125878","GM counter;GPS module Radiation Measurements;Internet of Things;Remote monitoring","Biomedical monitoring;Electron tubes;Ionizing radiation;Isotopes;Radiation detectors;Radiation monitoring","Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;computerised monitoring;data acquisition;local area networks;radiation monitoring","GM counter;GPS module;NodeMCU;Web server;detected measured radiation;geo tagged Internet of Things device;geo tagged IoT device;onizing radiation;radiation IoT platform;radiation exposure;radiation levels;radiation monitoring;radiation sensor;radiation sources;radiation values","","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As part of which we are adopting the use of wireless sensors that will keep the child to get monitored. Our system enables the child to get involved with some android games which will make him/her to think and act dynamically. The game scores and the sensor readings obtained from the child will be monitored and analyzed by the system and actions will be taken accordingly.

Are there any behaviors specific to each particular phase of viewing? Here, we propose a flexible and nonintrusive method based on the use of three categories of everyday connected objects (i.e. Smartphone, smartwatch and remote control). Data were collected during participants' interactions with a smart TV i.e. during three phases of viewing a TV program: before, during and after in an uncontrolled environment. A classification of these behaviors was done in order to identify the behaviors of viewers during each phase of TV-watching using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm, without prior pre-processing of the learning data. The results show that the viewers' behavior is very different from each other during the three phases. Thus, the behavior that was detected in two different phases did not have the same frequency of occurrence for all participants and was not performed by a given viewer with the same duration. In addition, the DNN algorithm gives a good average recognition performance of the three phases: 92.75%, 87.5% and 94% for the first second and third phase respectively. This study can help to better understand the viewers' behavior and anticipate certain actions in order to maintain their attention towards the proposed TV programs.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1645-1; POD:978-1-5386-1646-8; USB:978-1-5386-1644-4","10.1109/SMC.2017.8122886","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8122886","Deep neural networks;Iot;TV-viewing recognition;automatic classification;unconstrained environment [PATTERNRECOGNITION]","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Gyroscopes;Neural networks;Sensors;TV;Training","Internet of Things;behavioural sciences computing;digital television;neural nets","Deep Neural Network algorithm;IoT network;TV program;TV-watching;everyday connected objects;smart TV;viewers' TV-watching behaviors","","","","","","","","5-8 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT system consists of various technologies such as networking, sensor controller, edge-side computing, server-side big data collections, analysis and their visualizations. An experimental environment that can handle the development and experiments of such an IoT system become important. In the IoT system, a highly flexible system structure for applications using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is required. The authors propose the Remote Laboratory System for handling IoT experiments in the Cyber Laboratory, which is an educational FPGA-based remote laboratory for under-graduate university students. It enables not only to use available board-level small computers but also to use FPGA boards for prototyping IoT edges. It can also organize the IoT cloud-server side programs in the hybrid cloud. The FPGA based edge-side computing approach can have much more freedom and flexibility to implement various sensor controls those can be customized for specific IoT applications. The use of free micro-processor IP-core and re-organizing the available FPGA CAD design platform allow us to reduce the burden of design and implementation efforts for the construction of new Cyber Laboratory to accommodate IoT designs and experiments. It also contributed to reduce the students' amount of efforts to conduct their own IoT design and experiments, where students are required to have various skills in Information Technologies (IT): hardware design, edge-side computing, server-side computing, networking and infrastructure construction. The use of the Docker container/Swarm and the Docker File contributed to construct their own IoT experiment platforms for every student automatically, in the form of ""Infrastructure as Code"".

Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.","","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2769670","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094871","BCI;EEG big data;cloud computing;deep learning;epilepsy;seizure prediction and localization","Big Data;Brain-computer interfaces;Cloud computing;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Real-time systems","","","","","","","","Traditional","20171103","Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part.

This increased population demands improved medical facilities only to realize there are not adequate doctors on role leading to deaths of nearly 1M Indians every year & approximately 700M deprived of even preliminary health treatment thereby carrying 21% of the global disease burden. In general, doctors are either not willing to serve the rural areas or they are not available 24×7 that is causing rural population to travel to cities even for casual ailments. According to WHO (World Health Organization) reports, India have less than 0.7 doctor /1000 population which is lower as compared to ratio of 4.3 in Russian federation, 3.8 in Argentina, 2.4 in USA & WHO Benchmark. Indian government spends just around 30% of the total budget in healthcare which is a penny in comparison to the USA & the UK. This increased population demands lower operational cost with high accuracy, early detection followed by prevention. In this paper, a futuristic approach is proposed to support the existing healthcare system by designing a preliminary multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair with E-diagnostic feature within a medical booth, analogous to an ATM booth. The attractive part of our system is low priced diagnosis, non-invasiveness, indigenously built medical apparatus, misdiagnosis prevention with fast systematic approach.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3239-6; POD:978-1-5090-3240-2","10.1109/ICECCT.2017.8117810","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117810","BP;Business model;Doctor;ECG;Healthcare;Heart rate;NHP;Population report","Electrocardiography;Magnetic sensors;Medical services;Monitoring;Sociology;Statistics","Internet of Things;diseases;health care;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;telemedicine","E-diagnostic system;IOT based approach;India;World Health Organization;casual ailments;global disease;healthcare support;healthcare system;medical apparatus;medical booth;medical facilities;misdiagnosis prevention;multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair;rural areas;rural population","","","","","","","","22-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Operators of such environments may not even be fully aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This paper proposes the use of network traffic analytics to characterize IoT devices, including their typical behaviour mode. We first collect and synthesize traffic traces from a smart-campus environment instrumented with a diversity of IoT devices including cameras, lights, appliances, and health-monitors; our traces, collected over a period of 3 weeks, are released as open data to the public. We then analyze the traffic traces to characterize statistical attributes such as data rates and burstiness, activity cycles, and signalling patterns, for over 20 IoT devices deployed in our environment. Finally, using these attributes, we develop a classification method that can not only distinguish IoT from non-IoT traffic, but also identify specific IoT devices with over 95% accuracy. Our study empowers operators of smart cities and campuses to discover and monitor their IoT assets based on their network behaviour.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2784-6; POD:978-1-5386-2785-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116438","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116438","","Cameras;Communication system security;Intelligent sensors;Machine-to-machine communications;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;condition monitoring;telecommunication traffic","IoT assets;IoT device;nonIoT traffic;smart campuses;smart cities;smart-campus environment;time 3.0 week;traffic traces","","","","","","","","1-4 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can be considered as a promising solution for detecting, reporting emergency events, eliminating the hoax calls and responding swiftly saving lives.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3839-2; POD:978-1-5386-3840-8; USB:978-1-5386-3838-5","10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115830","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115830","IP communication session;Internet of Things;IoT;SIP based calls;eHealth;emergency calls;seizure;sensor devices","Conferences;Emergency services;Medical services;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;diseases;emergency services;health care","IoT automated SIP;IoT devices;IoTA framework;automatically emergency calls;bi-directional communication sessions;communication technologies;emergency call triggering system;emergency events;emergency incident;emergency services;general eHealth;healthcare providers;public safety stakeholders;support session-oriented communications","","","","","","","","9-11 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the view of the end-user, QoS should be high enough in order to guarantee an excellent applicability of the IoBNT, in particular when humans are part of the network and where efficient techniques of nanomedicine are foresen. In this paper, we present a scheme where the QoS is calculated when the IoBNT is applied for sensing abnormalities in kidney. For this end the following key points are considered: (i) sensing of charged proteins through THz waves, (ii) reception by bio-cyber device and subsequent emission of MHz waves, (iii) reception by smartphone, (iv) reception and storing of information at the cloud, (v) exchanging information with server and world-wide-web, and (vi) final reception and treatment of data by the enduser. The estimation of the full QoS has paid attention to the atomic absorption of THz waves by water in human tissue, fact which might degrade the optimal surveillance of the sensing of proteins and which is translated as the main source of errors. The full nonlinear expression is numerically evaluated by obtaining in average a QoS of order of 90±8%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3028-6; POD:978-1-5090-3029-3; USB:978-1-5090-3027-9","10.1109/NANO.2017.8117361","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117361","IoBNT;Kidney Disease;QoS","Estimation;Kidney;Nanomedicine;Proteins;Quality of service;Sensors","Internet of Things;biocomputing;nanomedicine;quality of service","Internet of bionanothings;IoBNT;MHz waves emission;QoS;THz waves;bio-cyber device;efficient techniques;end the following key points;end-user;excellent applicability;final reception;nanomedicine;parameter estimation;quality of service;sensing abnormalities;server;storing;world-wide-web","","","","","","","","25-28 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the Intensive Care Unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a bio-sensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real-time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system act as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application.

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence.

Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14).

The second approach multiplies the generated DDS signal using a frequency multiplier (F12). Counter-intuitive existence of low power harmonics (F13, F14, F11, F10, etc.) in the frequency multiplier added improvements in our tests. Tiny variations in environment are easily observed on specific bars in FFT of down-converted signals in the frequency multiplier approach. Both approaches work by sending a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) that reflects off objects present in the room. Based on the reflected signal, we calculate distances and movements, from which we then extract breathing and heart rates. In both approaches, we try two sets of microwave signals: Triangular FMCW and Sawtooth FMCW. Both approaches showed more obvious variation for body movement. In the case of the Triangular FMCW signal, interpreting data is more challenging. On the other hand, the Sawtooth FMCW signal resulted in clear output but lower power and harder to directly observe.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3281-9; POD:978-1-5386-3282-6","10.1109/FiCloudW.2017.105","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113799","Vital sign monitoring;m-health;signal processing","Bandwidth;Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate;Phase locked loops;Radar;Time-frequency analysis","direct digital synthesis;fast Fourier transforms;frequency modulation;medical signal detection;microwave measurement;patient monitoring;phase locked loops;pneumodynamics","Direct Digital Synthesizer;Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave;Sawtooth FMCW signal;Triangular FMCW signal;body movement;breathing;counter-intuitive existence;down-converted signals;frequency multiplier approach;generated DDS signal;heart rates;low power harmonics;m-health application;microwave signals;phase locked loop;reflected signal;remote monitoring;vital signs","","","","","","","","21-23 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such demands require constant update of the patients' electronic health record allied with support systems responsible for monitoring their clinical information. In this context, this paper presents a new web platform for daily monitoring of patients, designed to be used by health professionals, especially nurses. The application is based on React, an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The developed tool incorporates two main features: the real-time visualization of the data, and the storage of the patient's historic during an inpatient care episode. The storage capability allows keeping the data updated among hospital shifts. Moreover, this work also highlights the required adaptability of this platform for each health units inside a hospital center according with its needs.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3281-9; POD:978-1-5386-3282-6","10.1109/FiCloudW.2017.92","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113792","Healthcare;Hospital Information System;Interoperability;Nursing Practice","Clinical diagnosis;Hospitals;Information systems;Interoperability;Interviews;Organizations","Internet;electronic health records;health care;hospitals;open systems;patient care;public domain software;user interfaces","careful healthcare assistance;clinical information;continuous healthcare assistance;health institutions;health professionals;health units;hospital center;hospital inpatient care;hospital shifts;inpatient care episode;interoperability;nurses;nursing practice;open-source JavaScript library;patient electronic health record;real-time visualization;storage capability;support systems;user interfaces;web platform","","","","","","","","21-23 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Shepherds required to supervise animals, are getting increasingly less available and are costly. Over the last years, technologies for automatic animal supervision have been investigated, typically including devices to carry out localization, apply stimulus to the animals and, in some cases, report health data. Ovines have a relatively small size, which constrains the maximum weight that they can carry on, and consequently, imply that a practical system must be highly energy-efficient, to allow building light and small devices with enough autonomy. This paper presents a new system for sheep grazing control, developed in the scope of the SheepIT project.

The incremental scheduling problem for the constituent systems is formulated as an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem using IBM CPLEX.

In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2324-4; POD:978-1-5386-2325-1; USB:978-1-5386-2323-7","10.1109/MASS.2017.62","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108772","Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing;Shannon Mapping","Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Medical services;Power demand;Sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic","AJSCC device;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;Analog Signal compression;FPMM receiver;FPMM technique;IoT applications;IoT devices;IoT scalability;SNR operating region;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;analog domain;analog encoding;encoding method;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;healthcare Internet of Things;joint modulation;mean square error;miss detection rate;multiplexing technique;multisignal compression method;power consumption;power saving;traffic data","","","","","","","","22-25 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario.

However, wireless technology coexistence concerns are gaining increased attention. In response, coexistence test methods are now being reported in the literature, and novel solutions are considered in the American National Standards Institute C63.27 Standard for Evaluation of Wireless Coexistence. Furthermore, the IEEE 802 standards committee formed a new study group, named wireless automotive coexistence, operating under the umbrella of 802.19 working group to highlight the increasing concerns of wireless coexistence in the automotive domain. The radiated open environment coexistence test (ROECT) method offers high flexibility to test wireless devices for coexistence. Radio signal propagation during testing is over the air, reducing access to the signal path. Consequently, monitoring instantaneous device performance is a challenge yet to be addressed. This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the channel utilization of multiple, concurrent wireless transmitters sharing the 2.4-GHz ISM band in the context of ROECT. Passively received power measurements were collected during testing, and then a Gaussian mixture model was used to build a classifier for labeling observed power samples relative to their source. Case studies utilizing IEEE 802.11n as an interfering system with an under test system based on either IEEE 802.11n or ZigBee are detailed. Findings demonstrate the mutual effect of spectrum sharing on both interfering and under test systems in terms of per-second channel utilization and frame collision.

To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.","1089-7798;10897798","","10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010262","Cloud computing;Internet of Things (IoT);blindness;privacy;wireless body area networks (WBANs)","Body area networks;Cloud computing;Delays;Hospitals;Servers;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","20170814","Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This work defines the dimensionality in terms of the number of M2M devices that can be successfully connected, the required bandwidth, sensors mobility, and the transmission mode used. The mutual use of multi antennas, dense deployment of small cells, and the adoption of millimetre wave band, particularly in the 28GHz have been considered as the key enabling technologies to address the massive traffic generated by IoT. An algorithm has been set to schedule this type of traffic and to show whether the M2M devices completed their traffic upload or failed to reach the margin.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3007-5; POD:978-1-5386-3008-2","10.1109/CEEC.2017.8101604","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101604","5G network;IoT;M2M;connected health;millimetre wave","5G mobile communication;Biomedical monitoring;Brain modeling;Intelligent sensors;Machine-to-machine communications;Temperature sensors","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;cellular radio;machine-to-machine communication;microwave antenna arrays;telecommunication traffic","Internet of Things;IoT traffic;M2M links;cellular network;fifth generation networks;fixed sensors;frequency 28.0 GHz;machine-to-machine communication links;massive M2M traffic scheduling;massive connectivity;massive traffic;millimetre wave 5G network;millimetre wave band;sensors mobility;traffic upload;vehicle mobility;wearable devices;wireless devices;zero speed sensors","","","","","","","","27-29 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It causes deterioration in health leading to multi-organ failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user’s infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user’s mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090542","Chikungunya;Cloud Computing;Decision Tree;Fog Computing;Temporal Network Analysis (TNA).","Cloud computing;Decision trees;Monitoring;Pain;Real-time systems;Sensors","","","","","","","","","20171031","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an Anomaly Detection Framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is comprised of four modules: 1) Time-Sliced Anomaly Detection (TSAD), which detects Spatial, Temporal, and Spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) Real-time Emission Detection (RED), which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) Device Ranking (DR), which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) Malfunction Detection (MD), which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2766085","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8081731","PM2.5;anomaly detection.;data analysis;smart city","Anomaly detection;Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Sensors;Smart cities","","","","","","","","","20171024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The first segment assumes the communication between nanosensor and intra-body device, whereas in the second one the intra-body device is engaged to the bio-cyber interface through the THz band. Others segments belong to the macroscopic scale but working in the MHz band. When the full QoS is estimated and assuming the most optimistic scenario, our crude estimation for the concrete case applied to nanomedicine has turned out to to be of order of 85%.

The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part.

Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets.

In this paper, a framework of CPS is presented to describe the CPS as a 5C architecture, including Connection level, Conversion level, Cyber level, Cognition level and Configuration level. The 5C architecture clearly states how to convert data to information; so the transparency and predictability enable to predict the degradation of the critical assets so as to use the information for smarter decision support. The transformation from traditional maintenance strategy to predictive maintenance strategy is the highlight to enable the worry-free entities.

Yet, we have barely scratched the surface. Using existing and new technologies, we are connecting the physical world to the Internet. It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital.

In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4912-7; POD:978-1-5090-4913-4","10.1109/ICoICT.2017.8074640","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074640","Digital;Healthcare;IoT;Logic fuzzy;Monitoring;Thermometer","Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Monitoring;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Testing","Internet of Things;biomedical telemetry;fuzzy logic;health care;pacemakers;patient monitoring;telemetry;thermometers","HI;HI-Thermo;Hi-Thermo;Information Communication Technology;Remote Digital Blood Pressure;Telemetry Digital Pacemaker;WIFI digital thermometer;adaptive system;data transmission;digital systems;energy consumption;energy efficient IoT;energy issues;existing traditional monitoring;fever body temperature monitoring;fever monitoring;fuzzy logic;health services;monitoring fever body temperature","","","","","","","","17-19 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation.

From this server the information can be envisioned to the specialists and other paramedical staff by Thingspeak android app. In this way by utilizing this Smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of specialists and paramedical staffs to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore lessens the time and cost of support.","","DVD:978-1-5090-3241-9; Electronic:978-1-5090-3243-3; POD:978-1-5090-3244-0; Paper:978-1-5090-3242-6","10.1109/I-SMAC.2017.8058240","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8058240","Arduino Uno;Internet of Things (IoT);Thingspeak","Clouds;Heart beat;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical equipment;blood;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sugar","Arduino Uno board;ECG;IoT;Noninvasive sensors;Smart health monitoring system;Thingspeak android app;biomedical data;biomedical information;blood glucose;body position;detected biomedical information;health state;paramedical staff;patient health condition;patient health monitoring system;savvy urban areas;smart environment;smart home mechanization;time 24.0 hour","","","","","","","","10-11 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2708042","10.13039/100008982 - Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933942","Access control;implantable medical devices (IMDs);survey","Access control;Authentication;Communication system security;US Government agencies;Wireless communication","authorisation;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;message authentication;prosthetics","IMD access control schemes;IMD security;IMD threat model;authorized medical personnel;electronic devices;implantable medical devices;online authentication;zero power authentication","","","","","","Traditional","20170525","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity.

Although bicycles have various functions, they fail to provide cyclists with sufficient exercise-related information and post-exercise analysis. Therefore, this paper introduced a bicycle record system of ground conditions based on IoT which is combining smartphone and embedded system. The event data recorder comprised two parts, a “smartphone-based event data recorder”and “bicycle-based real-time information feedback system"". Using the event data recorder, this paper integrated and provided various types of real-time information for cyclists while they cycled to help them achieve their desired exercise results. After cycling, the cyclists could view cycling-related information through software analysis. This information included cycling routes taken, total cycling distance, and total calories burned. The event data recorder also saved information related to cycling routes, such as acceleration, deceleration, directional changes, and slope changes. By analyzing the recorded information, cyclists not only gained further insight into their exercise results but were also able to share cycling-related information through the Internet, which would benefit cyclists who had not cycled along this route before.

Recently, a new concept has emerged in relation with SG: transactive energy - a framework to integrate and coordinate multiple independent suppliers of electric services in an economic marketplace that enables purchases in a way that obeys the physical constrains of the underlying energy grid. Our team is developing a transactive energy framework called Open Access Smart Grids (OASIS). OASIS features a distribution-level marketplace where the underlying electric resources and services are open to access and provisioned by third parties. In this paper, we present a cloudbased and big data-enabled brokerage system for Smart grids, which is a critical component of OASIS.

Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2602823","Fundamental Science Projects of Shenzhen City; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; Projects of Guangdong R/D Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552528","Color angular pattern;PCANet;color histopathological image;color norm pattern;matrix-form classifier;random binary hashing","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image classification;Image color analysis;Principal component analysis","image classification;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;principal component analysis","C-RBH-PCANet algorithm;angular pattern;color channels;color norm pattern;color pattern random binary hashing-based PCaNet;computer-aided diagnosis;deep learning algorithm;feature learning;histopathological image classification;matrix-form classifier;multiple binary images;principal component analysis network","","6","","","","Traditional","20160825","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A promising strategy to address the problem is to allow selected people to remain in their homes and be monitored using recent advances in wearable devices, saving in-hospital resources. With respect to heart monitoring, wearable devices to date have principally used optical techniques by shining light through the skin. However, these techniques are severely hampered by motion artifacts and are limited to heart rate detection. Further, these optical devices consume a large amount of power in order to receive a sufficient signal, resulting in the need for frequent battery recharging. To address these shortcomings we present a new wrist ECG wearable that is similar to the clinical approach for heart monitoring. Our device weighs less than 30 g, and is ultra low power, extending the battery lifetime to over a month to make the device more appropriate for in-home health care applications. The device uses two electrodes activated by the user to measure the voltage across the wrists. The electrodes are made from a flexible ink and can be painted on to the device casing, making it adaptable for different shapes and users. In this paper we show how the ECG sensor can be integrated into an existing IoT wearable and compare the device's accuracy against other common commercial devices.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5873-0; POD:978-1-5090-5874-7","10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016260","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8016260","Body sensor networks;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Low power sensors","Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Heart rate;Monitoring;Wrist","biomedical equipment;electrocardiography;health care;patient care","ECG sensor;IoT wearable;battery recharging;energy efficient heart rate sensing;health care systems;heart monitoring;heart rate detection;in-home health care applications;optical techniques;painted electrode ECG wearable devices;wrist ECG wearable","","","","","","","","6-9 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advancing from storing pop songs to storing personal health or geo-location data, however, requires data subjects to get themselves acquainted with the quality features of data storage providers, should they wish to make an informed decision. The introduction chapter explores the consequences of the GDPR implementation in the European Union regarding the expectations towards storage of personal data, while the subsequent chapter explains the labeling decisions in this paper. The two ensuing chapters present the quality criteria for data storage widely used in contemporary reviews and completes them with additional dimensions advocated for by the author.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4722-2; POD:978-1-5090-4723-9; USB:978-1-5090-4721-5","10.1109/CHASE.2017.66","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010621","","Data privacy;Databases;Encryption;Medical services;Servers;Speech recognition","Internet of Things;cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition","background sound;caregiver queries;disabled people;elderly;encrypted voice data;healthcare systems;homomorphic encryption;in-home IoT devices;in-home healthcare applications;mHealth data;mood;patients;privacy-preserving voice-based search;smart personal assistants;speech recognition;tone;voice content;voice data privacy;voice feature similarity;voice recording;voice upload;voice-enabled feature","","","","","","","","17-19 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since CMOS sensors in smartphone cameras are very sensitive to UV radiation, smartphones have potential to be the ideal equipment to measure it. At the same time, result optimization can be achieved in real time by taking advantage of fog computing because fog servers are able to aggregate UV radiation data and compute the results at local areas. This paper exhaustively discussed a novel procedure that could measure UV radiation through smartphone cameras, and also briefly covered how to leverage fog computing to improve UV measurement accuracy. To implement the procedure, an Android app called UV meter was developed. Experiments were conducted by utilizing the app to validate and evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the procedure on both smartphones and smart watches. Results showed that the proposed procedure could achieve an average of 95% accuracy of a typical professional digital UV meter, and could be easily implemented on smart devices.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2717845","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954592","Fog computing;smart devices;ultraviolet (UV) measurement","Cameras;Edge computing;Intelligent sensors;Meteorology;Sea measurements;Smart devices","cameras;cloud computing;measurement;sensors;smart phones;ultraviolet radiation effects","CMOS sensors;UV radiation measurement;fog computing;fog servers;smart devices;smartphone cameras;ultraviolet radiation measurement","","","","","","","20170621","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback.

Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications.

In supply chain area, with the rapid growth of internet technologies, a lot of emerging technologies have been applied in traceability systems. However, to date, nearly all of these systems are centralized which are monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque that could result in the trust problem, such as fraud, corruption, tampering and falsifying information. Besides, centralized system is vulnerable to collapse, since a single point of breakdown will lead the whole system to be crashed. Today, a new technology called the blockchain which is a ground-breaking innovation in decentralized information technology presents a whole new approach. However, since this technology is still in its early stages, it has some inherent defects, in which scalability become a primary and urgent one when we face the mass data in the real world. In this paper we will build a food supply chain traceability system for real-time food tracing based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), blockchain and Internet of things, which could provide an information platform for all the supply chain members with openness, transparency, neutrality, reliability and security. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept BigchainDB to fill the gap in the decentralized systems at scale.

An adversary may tamper or clone these IoT devices for his or her benefit. Most of the modern operating systems today use attack prevention techniques based on No-eXecute (NX) memory page protection scheme, which prevents execution of malicious code injected into the device. But, Return Oriented Programming (ROP) has the capability to break this security cover and take control over the IoT device.

ZigBee is a low bit rate protocol utilised in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Attacks such as physical, crypto key interception, injection and replay are perpetrated on ZigBee networks. These attacks can be instigated and controlled within the physical ZigBee WSN location or via a gateway. This paper creates a honeypot that simulates a ZigBee gateway. It is designed to assess the presence of ZigBee attack intelligence on a SSH attack vector. It captures all attack traffic for retrospective analysis.

Current ENO approaches utilise techniques such as sample rate control, adaptive duty cycling and data reduction methods to balance energy generation, storage and consumption. However, the state of the art approaches makes a strong and unrealistic assumption that battery capacity is fixed throughout the deployment time of an application. This results in scenarios where ENO systems over allocate sensing tasks, therefore as battery capacity degrades it causes the system to no longer be energy neutral and then fail unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the problem to maximise the quality-of-service in terms of duty cycle and the battery capacity to extend the deployment lifetime of a sensing application. In addition, we develop a lightweight algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed method using real sensor energy consumption data captured from micro-climate sensors deployed in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London.

With the advancement of technology, working places have become more automated using machines to carry out the tasks that were hitherto done manually. These devices emit various solids and gases into the environment during their operation. These emissions contain many substances that are harmful to human health, when exposed to them for a prolonged period of time or more than certain levels of concentration.

The experimental system with a semiconductor sensor capable of monitoring ozone concentrations was installed near a high volume photocopier. The IoT device has been programmed to collect and transmit data at an interval of five minutes over blue tooth connection to a gateway node that in turn communicates with the processing node via the WiFi local area network.

Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results.

Many applications including industrial applications require the WSN to have a low and deterministic delay. Having a deterministic network delay in a WSN is challenging in the best case when traditional Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are employed. To enable low power, high reliability and deterministic WSNs, IETF recently proposed 6TiSCH protocol which uses time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) MAC with IPv6 addressing. This protocol dynamically assigns bandwidth resources to the nodes in the network according to the application requirements. This paper describes an implementation of 6TiSCH protocol in Contiki OS and a distributed scheduling mechanism for this protocol.

However, the supply of energy to the sensors plays a key role in the success of these applications as well as the design and deployment of these networks. Currently, most WSNs are powered by batteries, which must be replaced frequently, increasing maintenance costs and operational complexity. In this paper, we propose a practical framework, called wirelessly energy-charged (WINCH), for battery maintenance; it involves recharging sensor batteries using mobile robots. This framework integrates a routing process in which the cluster heads are selected optimally, as in the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized protocol (LEACH-C), and the robots visit the sites frequently based on need and place themselves in the optimal positions with respect to the selected cluster heads. This approach considerably reduces overhead compared with existing methods. Moreover, we have developed an empirical model of the energy charging rate for sensor nodes. We use this model to compute the amount of energy harvested by each sensor in the proximity of the mobile charger. Simulation experiments for a wide range of design parameters and using several metrics, such as energy consumption, network throughput, and coverage, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with an existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2709698","10.13039/501100004055 - deanship of scientific research at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935506","Internet of Things (IoT);energy harvesting;routing protocols;smart grid;wireless energy transfer;wireless sensor networks","Batteries;Mobile communication;Robot sensing systems;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","battery storage plants;electrical maintenance;energy consumption;inductive power transmission;mobile robots;routing protocols;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","WINCH;WSN;battery maintenance;cluster heads;energy consumption;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized protocol LEACH-C;maintenance costs;mobile charger;mobile robots;operational complexity;robot-assisted maintenance;routing process;sensor batteries;sensor nodes;wireless energy transfer;wireless sensor networks;wirelessly energy-charged","","","","","","","20170530","July15, 15 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4117-6; POD:978-1-5090-4118-3; USB:978-1-5090-4116-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7952278","Data-driven compressive sensing;Internet of things (IoT);mobile healthcare;wearable sensing","Biomedical monitoring;Dictionaries;Physiology;Sensors;Sparse matrices;Training;Wireless communication","compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction","ECG signals;compression ratio;cotraining approach;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;isometry property;long-term health monitoring;personalized features;physiologic signals;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;sensing matrix;signal characteristics;signal sparsity","","","","","","","","5-9 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth<sup>1</sup>, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using - n inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6517-2; POD:978-1-5090-6518-9","10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947025","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947025","","Air quality;Humidity;Medical services;Monitoring;Pediatrics;Sensors;Temperature measurement","Internet of Things;diseases;electronic health records;mobile computing;paediatrics;patient monitoring","EMR;asthma control level;asthma management;children;continuous patient monitoring;electronic medical records;kHealth framework;multimodal IoT;multimodal data processing;smart health application;vulnerability score","","","","","","","","29-31 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose a- innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting. The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6318-5; POD:978-1-5090-6319-2","10.1109/BigDataService.2017.53","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944929","Airborne diseases; IoT; healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); CEP; Internet Of Things; Venue Analytics; iOS; Android; Complex Event Processing; IoT reference architecture; Decision Tree; Machine Learning; Regression Analysis; Term Frequency and Inverse","Bluetooth;DC motors;Decision trees;Medical services;Protocols;Smart phones;Wireless fidelity","Big Data;Internet of Things;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;surface contamination","Big Data enabled intelligent dispenser;HAIs;Internet of Things;IoT sensing;airborne contamination;airborne diseases;airborne pathogen reduction;healthcare facilities;healthcare-associated infections;hospital infection control;iDispenser;machine learning;surface contamination;touchless systems","","","","","","","","6-9 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes ""in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand"". This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], ""more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products; the majority of these people live in developing countries"" [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urba- areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] ""the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks"". In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

To address this issue, we propose a SaaS-centered framework for manufacturing system health management. The configurability and easy evolution of SaaS can facilitate reuse and sharing of data, processes, and technologies. Besides the general framework, we also look into the technologies that are important for the framework.

In this paper, we present an approach to integrate contextual information within the data processing flow in order to improve the quality of measurements. We focus on a pilot application that uses wearable motion sensors to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of exergaming movements. Exergames need to show energy expenditure values, often using accelerometer approximations applied to general activities. We focus on two contextual factors, namely “activity type” and “sensor location,” and demonstrate how these factors can be used to enhance the measured values, since allocating larger weights to more informative sensors can improve the final measurements. Further, designing regression models for each activity provides better results than any generalized model. Indeed, the averaged R2 value for the movements using simple sensor location improve from a general 0.71 to as high as 0.84 for an individual activity type. The different methods present a range of R2 value averages across activity type from 0.64 for sensor location to 0.89 for multidimensional regression, with an average game play MET value of 7.93. Finally, in a leaveone-subject-out cross validation, a mean absolute error of 2.231 METs is found when predicting the activity levels using the best models.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2364407","10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6932440","Accelerometer;Context-Aware;Distributed Wearable Sensors;MET;Physical Activity;Quality Metric;Wireless Health;context-aware;distributed wearable sensors;metabolic equivalent of task (MET);physical activity;quality metric;wireless health","Accelerometers;Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Context modeling;Intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;Remote sensors;Wearable computing","biomedical communication;radio networks","MET value;accelerometer approximations;context-aware data processing;decision-making processes;metabolic equivalent of task;simple sensor location;wireless health systems","","6","","50","","","20141021","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals.

Recent research has shown that the perturbations of the radio-frequency (RF) signals commonly adopted for wireless communications can also be used as sensing tools for device-free human motion detection. Device-free RF-based human sensing applications range from tag-less body localization to detection and monitoring of human well-being (e-Health). In this paper, we propose a real-time system for human body motion sensing with special focus on joint body localization and fall detection. The proposed system continuously monitors and processes the RF signals emitted by industry-compliant radio devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and supporting machine-to-machine communication functions. Human-induced diffraction and multipath phenomena that affect RF signal propagation are leveraged for body localization while for fall detection a hidden Markov model is applied to discern different postures of the operator and to detect safety-relevant events by tracking the received signal strength indicator footprints. Fall detection performances are corroborated by extensive experimental measurements in different settings. In addition, we propose also a sensor fusion tool that is able to integrate the device-free RF-based sensing system within an industrial image sensors framework. Preliminary results, conducted during field trial measurements, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of localization accuracy, and sensitivity/specificity to correctly detect a fall event from preimpact postures.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2624800","Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche-Regione Lombardia projects, FIDEAS and CyberSort; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733160","Device-free fall detection;device-free localization;hidden Markov model;radio vision and sensor fusion","Cameras;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Radio frequency;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","RSSI;biomedical telemetry;hidden Markov models;image sensors;machine-to-machine communication;motion measurement;radiotelemetry;sensor fusion","ISM band;RF signal propagation;device-free RF human body fall detection;device-free RF human body fall localization;device-free RF-based human sensing applications;device-free human motion detection;field trial measurements;frequency 2.4 GHz;hidden Markov model;human well-being detection;human well-being monitoring;human-induced diffraction;industrial image sensor framework;industrial workplaces;industry-compliant radio devices;machine-to-machine communication functions;multipath phenomena;real-time system;received signal strength indicator footprint tracking;safe working environment;safety-relevant event detection;sensor fusion tool;tag-less body localization;wireless communications","","","","","","","20161103","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, most of these technologies are expensive, can only be used in laboratory environments, and examine only a few trials of each movement action. In this paper, we present a novel ambulatory motion analysis framework using wearable inertial sensors to accurately assess all of an athlete's activities in real training environment. We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2377238","(FP7/2007-2013); European Community¿s; 10.13039/501100001602 - Science Foundation Ireland (SFI); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6981909","Activity classification;Biomechanics;Curve shift registration;Knee joint angle;Sensor fusion;Smart and connected health;Technique assessment;Wearable inertial sensor;biomechanics;curve shift registration;knee joint angle;sensor fusion;smart and connected health;technique assessment;wearable inertial sensor","Accelerometers;Biomedical monitoring;Discrete wavelet transforms;Injuries;Intelligent sensors;Medical devices;Medical services;Motion control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","discrete wavelet transforms;gradient methods;medical signal processing;signal classification;sport","DWT;automatic activity classification;computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm;curve-shift registration technique;discrete wavelet transform;motion analysis technologies;movement assessment;random forest classifier;sports training session;wearable inertial sensors","","12","","51","","","20141210","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups.

Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world.

To achieve ubiquitous data transportation among objects and the surrounding environment, deploying spectrum sharing M2M communications with existing wireless networks is a must. A general large-scale cognitive M2M network (CM2MN), adopting cognitive radio technology, consists of multiradio systems, the primary system (PS), and secondary system(s) with tremendous cooperative cognitive machines, under heterogeneous wireless architecture. For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution, the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing in large CM2MNs.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478435","10.13039/501100001868 - National Science Council, National Taiwan University, and Intel Corporation; 10.13039/501100003711 - Ministry of Science and Technology; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7264970","Cognitive radio;cooperative relay;effective capacity;machine-to-machine (M2M) communications;network coded multipath routing;statistical quality-of-service (QoS) control","Delays;MIMO;Network coding;Quality of service;Relays;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","MIMO communication;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;fading channels;network coding;probability;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing","MIMO communications;cognitive machine-to-machine networks;cognitive radio technology;cooperative cognitive machines;dynamic spectrum access;flow control mechanisms;health care;heterogeneous wireless architecture;multiple-input and multiple-output communications;multiradio systems;network coded multipath routing;primary system;probabilistic network coded routing algorithm;quality-of-service;secondary system;smart grid;spatial multiplexing;spectrum sharing;statistical QoS control;ubiquitous data transportation;vehicular safety;wireless fading links;wireless networks","","5","","","","","20150914","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline.

Any downtime due to these devices, even for a few minutes, may result in major business impact. There are many proactive event management systems/products which can monitor their health and alert on device failure. However, predicting failure with sufficient lead time still remains a challenging problem. Event management systems take system log messages and simple network management protocol (SNMP) traps as inputs and typically use rule based framework to generate network events. In this paper we discuss how we can use event data alone to build predictive model for device failures. Here all event data is generated by an event management tool. Event data volume is substantially less compared to full system log data. Also, these network devices fail rarely. Lower volume of event data enables us collect historical data for longer durations and thus collect decent number of failure samples over time which we can use for training and validation. We present a prediction model for failure events based on event sequence data. We have introduced new stratified sampling techniques along with a new feature engineering method using sliding time windows on event data.

We have evaluated binary classification algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR).

In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists.

Usually, it takes long time to learn Taichi Chuan and doesn't combine well with our daily life. Our paper introduces a imaginary Taichi suit in the future. The Taichi suit can real-time monitor your body signs and your surroundings. According to the relevant data, it can design a unique set of Taichi for you. Or it'll remind you and help you to avoid accidental collision with the outside world. Its mechanism is to use vary and several sensors inside and outside the suit. Inside sensors detect the wearer's heart rate, body temperature, respiration, movement fluency, and the corresponding conclusions such as the balance. According to the conclusions, users will exercise specific joints or parts of the body with the help of the suit to restore the body to health level. Outside sensors' function is to real-time monitor the wearer's surroundings and detect surrounding objects and their move speed to judge whether there's danger. Taichi suit stores each decomposition action of Taichi Chuan. It can intelligently select several actions and compose a set of movements suitable for the wearer to practice Taichi. There is a machine exoskeleton in the clothing material, which gives the wearer a certain external force to help the wearer move more accurately and conveniently to practice. Especially when several rapid motion objects appear to user, Taichi suit will warn the wearer. And at the same time, the exoskeleton will guide the wearer to avoid dangerous.

The vibration sensor is place on the top of the solenoid valve and the vibration signal is collected by Labview SignalExpress system. The amplitude of the signal is extracted by denoising algorithm based on Wavelet and analyzed to detect the working state with the help of health index. The method is not interfered by the power supply system, and the method enhance the ability to resist interference.

In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.33","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917061","Cloud;Elasticity;Hospitals;Performance","Cloud computing;Databases;Elasticity;Hospitals;Radiofrequency identification","Web services;biomedical equipment;client-server systems;cloud computing;decision making;health care;medical information systems;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;virtual machines","EMH model;RFID;centralized management control center;client-server Web service;cloud elasticity facility;distributed framework;elastic multihospital management model;health equipments;medical treatment;motion detection;multihospital environments;multiple healthcare institutions;object elastic management;physical space elastic management;radio-frequency identification sensor tracking technology;real-time decision making;virtual machines","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario","P.

In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5256-1; POD:978-1-5090-5257-8; USB:978-1-5090-5255-4","10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917942","Authorization;IOT;Json Web Token;OAuth 2.0","Authentication;Authorization;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Real-time systems;Servers","Internet;Internet of Things;application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;open systems;real-time systems","IoT cloud scenario;JSON Web token;OAuth 2.0;authorization framework;automatic monthly payments;bank account;interoperable API;phishing attack;real time clinical care;secure health care services","","","","","","","","14-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, SmartFDS includes offline training phase and online activity recognition phase. Specifically, in training phase, utilizing the embedded accelerometer sensor, falling data for various situations are collected to extract the desired features that can appropriately characterize the falling behavior. Considering that the raw data are intrinsically prone to noise and error, those data are preprocessed by weighted smoothing. Then, 6 time-domain features are elaborated to determine the discriminative features for characterizing falling, and two features, maximum and vertical velocity are selected. Then, 4 different classification algorithms are investigated, and SVM is selected.

While WSN has the abilities of sensing, processing and communication over distances, its abilities are limited by the capacity of its battery. To use the full functionalities of WSN, either the battery needs to replace or recharge in a periodically manner. However both solutions are not convenient for livestock monitoring system. The only way to solve the issue effectively and efficiently is to recharge the battery wirelessly. Due to the harsh operating environment, the sensor node has to be waterproofed within a sealed enclosure which then brings up a mind-boggling challenge of how to charge a battery when it is concealed? Therefore, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) solution seems to be a sole solution to solve the issue in WSN for livestock farming.

Specifically, when a person's footstep-generated floor vibrations can be detected and located then it is possible to locate persons moving within a building. This emergent cyber-physical system holds the potential for an ambient localization service. This service would enable indoor localization without needing the building occupants to carry a device that enables localization as required by some wireless localization technologies. Vibration propagation in buildings has complexities not encountered by acoustic or radio wave propagation in air. Thus, conventional localization algorithms do not address the technical challenges of this application. This paper identifies different aspects of propagation relevant to the task of footstep localization and adapts techniques from seismology and signal processing to formulate a localization strategy. Experiments conducted in an instrumented, public building validate the proposed approach. Footstep localization to sub-meter accuracy appears feasible.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4545-7; POD:978-1-5090-4546-4; USB:978-1-5090-4544-0","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905997","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7905997","Cyber-Physical System (CPS);Indoor Localization;Internet of Things (IoT);Seismic;Smart Building","Accelerometers;Concrete;Instruments;Seismic measurements;Time measurement;Vibrations","Global Positioning System;cyber-physical systems;radiowave propagation;seismology;signal processing","I-LoViT;ambient localization service;emergent cyber-physical system;footstep localization;footstep-generated floor vibrations;indoor localization data;public building;seismology;signal processing;structural health monitoring;submeter accuracy;vibration propagation;vibration tracking;wireless localization technologies","","","","","","","","7-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most important element on their thought is communication bandwidth that is directly affected the data processing performance and communicating each other. The way for getting wider bandwidth involves three approaches which are high speed clocking, many lanes and high data compression. The first two issues relate with packaging technology which would be presented some. We additionally consider data compression technology. The system performance balance should put together the three issues. Let's focus in the three issues now. While power saving is another one of the most important things in not only DC's but mobiles.

This implementation of RPL is designed with a new dynamic Objective-Function (D-OF) to improve the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption while maintaining low packet overhead and loop-avoidance. We propose a controlled reverse-trickle timer based on received signal strength identification (RSSI) readings to maintain high responsiveness with minimum overhead and consult the objective function when a movement or an inconsistency is detected to help nodes make an informed decision. Simulations are done using Cooja with random waypoint mobility scenario for healthcare applications considering multi-hop routing.

In the existing system there is a need of another person for monitoring the patient condition. The proposed system eliminates the need of such manual observation of the patient. This system mainly consists of three components iMed box, iMed pack, Bio_patch which plays an important role. The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position.

Most of these applications require a variety of heterogeneous and geographical sensor data to be delivered to users such as mobile devices, vehicles, and cloud systems for big data analysis to extract maximum value from the physical world. Data caching of popular data items in a network can significantly improve efficiency and reliability of content delivery by contributing the reduction of data access delay, bandwidth usage, and packet losses in resource-limited low-rate wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient cache placement protocol (BCDA) that minimizes data access cost and guarantees cache consistency in a lightweight manner. The BCDA decides where to store a copy of data content in a network using a distributed approach according to clients' access patterns, memory capacity, data size, and so on. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness, we implemented the BCDA in ns-2 and compared its performance with existing caching strategies. The simulation results highlight that the BCDA significantly reduces data access cost with minimizing cache management cost.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4588-4; POD:978-1-5090-4589-1","10.1109/ICCNC.2017.7876128","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7876128","","","protocols;wireless sensor networks","BCDA;Internet of Things;cache management cost;content delivery sensor networks;data caching;distributed approach;on-demand cache placement protocol","","","","","","","","26-29 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people. The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The succe- sful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures.

Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly.

Blood sugar level of body is a very important factor for health and it should be maintain within the desired level or else this would result in complications and often serious damage to the body. Therefore treatment must be provided in case of high or low blood sugar level. In case of high blood sugar level, insulin must be injected and in case of low blood sugar level we should inject glucagon into the body. This paper is concerned on advanced method of simulation that can be used to implement a real insulin and glucagon pump that can work in real time to prevent the fatal effects of diabetes on body. This system also covers all the safety critical system aspect required to build a system that has a direct effect on human life. To provide better insulin and glucagon management and to reduce the need for human supervision, we have implement a control algorithm for the insulin and glucagon pump to automate the delivery process. The control algorithm adapts the glucose metabolic rate and determine the appropriate amount of insulin or glucagon to be delivered into the body. Method that is followed is effective and efficient in maintaining the blood sugar level. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system is very easy and user friendly that makes it easier for the patient and doctor to use.

However, according to statistics reports, annual global mortality for cardiovascular diseases remained as high as 29%, of which coronary artery disease (CAD) is accounted for 42%. Unfortunately, almost half of the patients not knowing they are at risk of cardiovascular diseases until serious symptoms occurred. Here, we proposed an early warning system by integrating IoT, big data, and cloud computing technologies which physically linked among personal communication devices of patient/doctor, cloud systems, and hospital medical information systems.

"IOT based smart garbage alert system using Arduino UNO","N. S. Kumar; B. Vuayalakshmi; R. J. Prarthana; A. Shankar","Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College, Coimbatore, TamilNadu, India","2016 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON)","20170209","2016","","","1028","1034","Waste management is one of the primary problem that the world faces irrespective of the case of developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor & ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management. This paper proposes a smart alert system for garbage clearance by giving an alert signal to the municipal web server for instant cleaning of dustbin with proper verification based on level of garbage filling. This process is aided by the ultrasonic sensor which is interfaced with Arduino UNO to check the level of garbage filled in the dustbin and sends the alert to the municipal web server once if garbage is filled. After cleaning the dustbin, the driver confirms the task of emptying the garbage with the aid of RFID Tag. RFID is a computing technology that is used for verification process and in addition, it also enhances the smart garbage alert system by providing automatic identification of garbage filled in the dustbin and sends the status of clean-up to the server affirming that the work is done. The whole process is upheld by an embedded module integrated with RF ID and IOT Facilitation. The real time status of how waste collection is being done could be monitored and followed up by the municipality authority with the aid of this system. In addition to this the necessary remedial / alternate measures could be adapted. An Android application is developed and linked to a web server to intimate the alerts from the microcontroller to the urban office and to perform the remote monitoring of the cleaning- process, done by the workers, thereby reducing the manual process of monitoring and verification. The notifications are sent to the Android application using Wi-Fi module.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2597-8; POD:978-1-5090-2598-5; USB:978-1-5090-2596-1","10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848162","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7848162","Arduino UNO;MSL;RFID;Ultrasonic Sensor;Wi-Fi;e-Monitoring","Acoustics;Diseases;Embedded systems;Monitoring;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Waste management","Internet of Things;file servers;radiofrequency identification;waste management","Android application;Arduino UNO;IOT facilitation;RFID tag;Wi-Fi module;cleaning process;developed country;developing country;garbage clearance;garbage management;municipal Web server;smart alert system;smart intelligent garbage alert system;ultrasonic sensor;waste management","","","","","","","","22-25 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery.

Due to the importance of the target applications in the daily life, BASNs are a promising candidate for being included into the future Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the data gathering of the human activity may help customizing the services provided by the IoT and thus dramatically improve the IoT user experience. Magnetic Induction (MI) based communication is known in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT), near-field communication (NFC), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in challenging environments. In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate. In this work, we analyze the potential of the distributed beamforming based MI-BASNs. We observe a significant increase of the achievable data rate for the proposed distributed beamforming compared to our selected baseline scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1328-9; POD:978-1-5090-1329-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841737","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841737","","","Internet of Things;MIMO communication;array signal processing;body area networks;body sensor networks;electromagnetic induction;health care;near-field communication;radiofrequency power transmission","Internet of Things;IoT user experience improvement;MI based communication;MIMO system;NFC;WPT;WSN;distributed beamforming based MI-BASN;healthcare;human activity data gathering;magnetic induction based body area sensor network;near-field communication;virtual multiple input multiple output system;wireless power transfer","","1","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To cope with this deficiency, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme adapted to eHealth systems considering a normal and an emergency health scenarios. Our proposed scheme satisfies both content and contextual privacy requirements, as well as secure communications and quality of service (QoS). To do, we used an identity-based encryption scheme, a set of privacy mechanisms, and a prioritized queuing model.

This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4470-2; POD:978-1-5090-4471-9","10.1109/WI.2016.0054","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817071","Bayesian inference;Nominal matrix factorization;probabilistic hierarchical model;routine pattern discovery","Bayes methods;Manganese;Matrix decomposition;Probabilistic logic;Robustness;Smart homes;Sparse matrices","Bayes methods;Internet of Things;behavioural sciences;data mining;health care;home automation;intelligent sensors;intelligent structures;matrix decomposition;mobile computing;pattern clustering;vectors","Bayesian lasso;Bayesian nominal matrix factorization;Internet of Things;IoT;activity pattern mining;basis vector reconstruction accuracy;basis vectors;daily activity routine analysis;data-driven paradigm;health care;hierarchical probabilistic model;human behavioral analysis;human interpretation;nominal data matrix decomposition;ordinal matrix factorization;senior adult well-being;sensor data collection;smart home;smart sensor technologies","","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data.

These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively.

One is that meal records are inputted by hand and managed as meal logs. Another one is that a meal image is shot by a smart phone, and meal contents are recorded by image recognition. However, these systems need a lot of time for inputting of meal contents or shooting of meal images. Therefore, it is difficult to continue use. Moreover, the second system has a problem for accuracy of image recognition. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a meal information collection system which uses IoT wireless tags. An IoT wireless tag is corresponded to a meal and the system can automatically get meal information such as meal contents, meal sequence, meal time and so on.

Consequently, various efforts were made in order to improve the quality of lifestyle for the elderly. Related to this issue, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) works to create better living conditions for older or disable people. AAL systems are able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sensors. In this paper, we propose an AAL architecture for the monitoring of elderly people, able to guarantee the collection of heterogeneous sensor data as well as the detection of critical events such as the older adult fall. A remote reasoning system processes this data with the aim of generating appropriate events. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a proof of concept was used and validation functional tests were carried out.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3254-9; POD:978-1-5090-3255-6","10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794963","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7794963","Ambient Assisted Living;Home Care;Internet of Things","","array signal processing;assisted living;electroencephalography;handicapped aids;medical signal processing","AAL systems;ambient assisted living system;disable people;elderly assistance applications;elderly people;health status;heterogeneous sensor data;remote reasoning system","","1","","","","","","4-8 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD con- ersion.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2549363","Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study at the University of California, San Diego; Institute for the Study of Aging, with participation from the U.S. FDA; Laboratory of Neuroimaging at the University of California, Los Angeles; Northern California Institute for Research and Education; Pfizer Inc., Wyeth Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co.

Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers for connected smartphone apps, wearables typically come equipped with a wide variety of different sensors such as accelerometers, pulsometors, and thermometers to capture data such as, respectively, the user's movements, heart-rate, and temperature. Once data is captured it is then typically wirelessly transmitted, using Bluetooth LE (low energy) to an awaiting smartphone. Since the data may be sensitive and/or personally identifiable, it is critical that this exchange and the pairing mechanisms used to set up the connection remain secure and resilient to eavesdropping attacks. This paper empirically evaluates the data exchange mechanisms of a variety of major commercial wearable products to determine if, and how well, the products live up to this security constraint. As part of this effort, the work also investigates the three different types of Bluetooth LE pairing strategies at a packet and protocol level. The results show presumably secure pairing strategies have glaring security vulnerabilities that affect all of the devices examined. In addition to this publication, efforts are underway to report these vulnerabilities to US-CERT.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2625-8; POD:978-1-5090-2626-5","10.1109/MobServ.2016.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7787031","Bluetooth;internet of things;man-in-the-middle attacks;pairing;security;vulernability discovery;wearables","Advertising;Biomedical monitoring;Bluetooth;Protocols;Security;Sensors;Trade agreements","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;electronic data interchange;security of data;sensors;smart phones;wearable computers","Bluetooth LE pairing;data exchange mechanism security;eavesdropping attacks;fitness tracking;mobile health monitoring;packet level;protocol level;sensors;smartphone apps;wearable Internet of Things","","1","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository.

Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys.

These diseases which include various ailments in the form of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, mental health illness, cancers, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are the biggest challenge for India and these diseases are the main cause of hospitalization for elder people. People who have suffered from chronic diseases are needed to repeatedly monitor the vital signs periodically. The number of nurses in hospital is relative low compared to the number of patients in hospital, there may be a chance to miss to monitor any patient vital signs which may affect patient health. In this paper, real time monitoring vital signs of a patient is developed using wearable sensors. Without nurse help, patient know the vital signs from the sensors and the system stored the sensor value in the form of text document. By using data mining approaches, the system is trained for vital sign data. Patients give their text document to the system which in turn they know their health status without any nurse help. This system enables high risk patients to be timely checked and enhance the quality of a life of patients.","","","10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727048","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727048","cardiovascular disease;chronic diseases;data mining;vital signs;wearable sensors","Biomedical monitoring;Data mining;Data models;Diseases;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;biosensors;data mining;diseases;hospitals;patient monitoring;pattern classification;text analysis;wearable computers","India;cancer;cardiovascular diseases;chronic disease monitoring;chronic lung diseases;data mining approaches;diabetes;elder people;hospital;mental health illness;patient health;patient life quality;stroke;text document;vital sign IoT based classification;vital sign real time monitoring;wearable sensors","","1","","","","","","7-8 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, we have observed that a plethora of interconnected smartphones, devices, and sensors are deployed for providing personalized services (e.g., social media, smart home, health monitoring) at any time from anywhere. The personalized services offered by IoT, although enhancing the quality of our lives, have serious challenges of securing networks and data in transit, as every day a myriad of devices and services are connected to the IoT. However, existing security solutions, such as two-factor authentication based on passwords along with second-level protection may not be efficient and reliable for providing end-to-end secure communication solutions among different devices and services connected to the IoT. To this end, this article proposes an end-to-end secure IoT-based solution using biometrics and pairing-based cryptography. Because of the uniqueness of one's biometric traits (e.g., face, fingerprint, palm, iris, voice, heartbeat), a biometric-based security solution is less vulnerable to security breaches for IoT systems or infrastructure. We present a biometric- based IoT infrastructure comprising four layers, and for each layer, we discuss possible security challenges along with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we provide a case study of face-based biometric recognition, where sensors or smartphones capture a face image and securely transmit it to the IoT platform to provide end-to end security.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2016.7721741","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7721741","","Authentication;Computer security;Internet of things;Security;Smart devices;Smart phones;Social network services;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;cryptography;face recognition","biometric traits;biometric-based IoT infrastructure;end-to-end biometrics-based security;end-to-end secure IoT-based solution;end-to-end secure communication solutions;face image;face-based biometric recognition;network security;pairing-based cryptography;pervasive communication;sensors;smartphones","","7","","","","","","October 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure. Using the model, diseases are ranked according to the current symptoms and stored in the server. Information of diseases and appropriate treatment therapies is sent back to the patient as well as stored in a web portal for personal monitoring.","","","10.1109/NICS.2016.7725627","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7725627","","","Internet of Things;bioinformatics;diseases;health care;patient monitoring;patient treatment;pattern clustering;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","ESP8266 sensors;IVSM;Internet-of-Thing technology;IoT device;IoT technology;LM35 sensors;disease diagnosis;health informatics;heart beat;heart failure;hypothermia;intelligent system;intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system;intuitionistic fuzzy set;intuitionistic fuzzy vector;intuitionistic vector similarity measure;knowledge model;multicriteria IFRS;network connection;personal healthcare monitoring;physical conditions;pulse sensor;single-criterion IFRS;tachycardia;temperature measurement;viral fever","","","","","","","","14-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591351","","Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Monitoring;Parallel processing;Program processors;Sensors","Internet of Things;cardiology;diseases;health care;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes","Internet-of-hearts;data analytics;disease pattern recognition;global network;large-scale dynamic network;map reduce;mobile health system;mobile technology;multiple processors;network optimization;parallel computing;sensing technology;smart connected healthcare;stochastic gradient descent approach","","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many cases, real measurements are taken so as to map signal strengths, interferences, and so on. However, taking real measurements is very time consuming and becomes impractical in complex, large scenarios. With the aim to avoid this burden, simulation techniques based on Ray Tracing, combining Geometric Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction, are used to predict waves' behaviour within a given environment. Those simulations depend on a number of parameters, namely angular resolution, number of rebounds, cells size, etc. By tuning these parameters, high-definition (HD) and low-definition (LD) results can be obtained. Although more practical than manual measurements, the computational cost of simulations in HD prevents their use in complex environments and their LD counterparts are applied. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) that allows the use of LD simulations (with low computational cost) by lessening their low quality problems. The proposed CF strategy exploits spacial constraints in 2D propagation planes to improve simulation results, which end up being very similar to those of HD, with a fraction of its computational cost.","","","10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580801","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580801","Collaborative Filtering;Ray Launching;Smart Health;Wireless Channel Characterization","Collaboration;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Databases;Filtering;High definition video;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;collaborative filtering;medical computing;wireless channels","2D propagation planes;IoT;angular resolution;antennas deployment planning;cells size;collaborative filtering;complex environments;geometric optics;high-definition results;low-definition results;low-quality problems;medical complex scenarios;ray tracing;rebound number;signal strengths;simulation techniques;two-dimensional collaborative filtering approach;uniform theory-of-diffraction;wave behaviour;wireless channel characterization","","1","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sensor nodes along with their heterogeneous nature are the main part of the IoT and may act as internet hosts or clients. Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication. By using this protocol, resource-constrained nodes can also benefit from the same security functionalities that are typical of unconstrained domains, without however having to execute computationally intensive operations. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic operations of constrained nodes to the neighboring trusted nodes or devices. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is sufficiently energy efficient.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2088-1; POD:978-1-5090-2089-8","10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568379","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568379","Authentication;Healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);Key Management;Resource-constrained;Security","Decision support systems","Internet;Internet of Things;biosensors;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;health care;message authentication;private key cryptography","IP-enabled sensor nodes;Internet clients;Internet connection;Internet hosts;Internet of Things;IoT context;authentication;communication security;computationally intensive operations;cryptographic primitives;end-users privacy protection;energy efficiency;healthcare applications;heterogeneous sensors;performance evaluation;physical objects;resource-constrained healthcare sensors;resource-constrained nodes;secret key distribution;secure end-to-end key establishment protocol;security analysis;strong encryption","","2","","","","","","18-22 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.","","","10.1109/NaNA.2016.26","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7564161","6LoWPAN;BLE;CoAP;ISO/IEEE 11073;IoT","IEEE Standards;ISO Standards;Internet of things;Logic gates;Medical services;Protocols;Servers","Bluetooth;IEEE standards;IP networks;ISO standards;Internet of Things;health care;protocols;telemedicine","6LoWPAN;BLE network;Bluetooth Low Energy network;CoAP;IP communication;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services;Internet-of-Things;IoT-based healthcare services;constrained application protocol","","","","","","","","23-25 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though data security and privacy have been widely investigated over the past thirty years, today we face new difficult data security and privacy challenges. Some of those challenges arise from increasing privacy concerns with respect to the use of data and from the need of reconciling privacy with the use of data for security in applications such as homeland protection, counterterrorism, and health, food and water security. Other challenges arise because the deployments of new data collection and processing devices, such as those used in IoT systems, increase the data attack surface.

The QoS provisioning mechanisms mostly focus on the MAC layer and do not extend easily across all platforms. We propose to integrate the QoS design into the application layer using the standard CoAP framework. CoAP architecture is a platform independent standard intended to be used in simple electronics devices such as Internet of Things (IoT). We introduce three CoAP features such as Caching, Confirmability and Multicast addressing.

Technologies such as smart energy, smart transportation or smart health are being designed to improve citizen's quality of life. Smart Cities leverage the deployment of a network of devices - sensors and mobile devices-, all connected through different means and/or technologies, according to their network availability and capacities, setting a novel framework feeding end-users with an innovative set of smart services. Aligned to this objective, a typical Smart City architecture is organized into layers, including a sensing layer (generates data), a network layer (moves the data), a middleware layer (manages all collected data and makes it ready for usage) and an application layer (provides the smart services benefiting from this data). In this paper a real Smart City is analyzed, corresponding to the city of Barcelona, with special emphasis on the layers responsible for collecting the data generated by the deployed sensors. The amount of daily sensors data transmitted through the network has been estimated and a rough projection has been made assuming an exhaustive deployment that fully covers all city.

We identified four pillars of information security in healthcare institutions: administrative measures, physical measures, data exchange with reliable institutions, and adapting of measures to changes.

Most present indoor localization systems require additional hardware for this estimation which is costly in terms of money and energy consumption. To overcome this disadvantage, we developed a system which is able to perform distance measurements without adding any extra hardware and costs. It is based on phase measurements performed by the IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver chip that is normally solely used to realize communication.

These limitations cannot only compromise applications' performance but can also affect trust and security in the IoT ecosystem. Besides security and trust, energy efficiency is also of paramount importance as sensors are often battery-operated. For energy minimisation and data security purposes, several contributions have mainly focused either on data compression, or data encryption; however, considering those as two independent operations. The last few years, the Compressive Sensing theory has shown that compression and encryption can be used simultaneously, given that data are sparse in some domain. As data sparsity cannot be known in advance, here, we present a practical implementation of a compressive sensing system where the data sparsity is estimated, and the compression rate is selected accordingly. Our system consists of two entities: a server implemented in Java running on a powerful machine, and a client that runs in a miniature sensor, developed in C and executing in the Contiki operating system.

Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0898-8; POD:978-1-5090-0899-5","10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501720","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501720","","Algorithm design and analysis;Autism;Dementia;Sensors;Smart phones","application program interfaces;health care;medical computing;medical disorders;mobile computing;pattern recognition","Alzheimers disorder;Alzimio app;Android API;activity recognition algorithms;autism;dementia;max-in-window algorithm;mobile app;safe-zone geofencing;smartphones;threshold-based algorithms","","","","16","","","","18-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states.

In IoT based healthcare, diverse distributed devices aggregate, analyse and communicate real time medical information to the cloud, thus making it possible to collect, store and analyse the large amount of data in several new forms and activate context based alarms. This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system. This work explains the implementation of an IoT based In-hospital healthcare system using ZigBee mesh protocol. The healthcare system implementation can periodically monitor the physiological parameters of the In-hospital patients.

The design of multiple band antennas is a task of reverse engineering in which the resonances of the antenna structure are tuned to given center frequencies. In this presentation it is shown how SoS (Statistics on Structures) in combination with electromagnetic field simulation using ANSYS HFSS can be used to generate a field meta model of optimal prognosis for the frequency response of the return loss. This field meta model is used to optimize the antenna with no additional solver runs. Also, this procedure allows to re-define scalar optimization criteria, after the DOE (Design of Experiment) has been calculated, by extracting quantities like the position and width of minima from the field meta model for the full frequency response. This allows for a lot of flexibility during the process of optimization.","","Electronic:978-8-8907-0186-3; POD:978-1-5090-2234-2","10.1109/EuCAP.2016.7481395","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7481395","","Dipole antennas;Frequency response;Optimization;Prognostics and health management;Resonant frequency;Scattering parameters","Internet of Things;design of experiments;multifrequency antennas;optimisation;statistics","ANSYS;DOE;HFSS;Internet of Things;IoT;design of experiment;dual-band-antenna;electromagnetic field simulation;field meta model;multiple band antennas;return loss;statistics on structures;wireless devices","","","","8","","","","10-15 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario.

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8325-7; POD:978-1-4673-8326-4","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454499","Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network;eHealthcare","Computer crime;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computer network security;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","DoS attacks;Internet of things;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;data packet delivery ratio;denial of service attacks;wireless mesh network;wireless mesh routing protocol","","3","","21","","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested by analyzing healthcare data sets, mainly comprises of activities including walking, running, ECG. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core™i5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. The results show that the proposed architecture efficiently analyze the massive volume of data with a maximum throughput.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6314-0; POD:978-1-4799-6315-7","10.1109/ICSensT.2015.7438483","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7438483","IoT;architecture;efficiency;healthcare;throughput","Accelerometers;Decision making;Servers;Social network services;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","Big Data;Internet of Things;electrocardiography;gait analysis;health care","Big data;ECG;Hadoop single node setup;Internet of Things;UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core i5 machine;computational efficiency;dynamic data;healthcare data sets;running;walking","","3","","25","","","","8-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many organizations in the globe have surveys and announces emerging or disruptive technologies every year. Of course, they have developed their own processes to achieve the goal, but the insights of experts from related domains are usually absolute. In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results. We named this approach as Chi(Computer Human Interacting)-Delphi method for technology foresight. As Web goes to connect machine intelligences in the era of Internet of Things, the collaboration between human intelligence and machine intelligence will be eventually the next great wave for predicting the future.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8139-0; POD:978-1-4673-8140-6","10.1109/KST.2016.7440470","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440470","","Cognition;Collaboration;Floods;Internet;Machine intelligence;Organizations;Text mining","Internet;artificial intelligence;data mining;forecasting theory;groupware;health care;human computer interaction;inference mechanisms;security of data","Chi-Delphi method;InSciTe;Internet security;KISA;KISTI;KRIBB;NIPA;collaboration;complex event processing;computer human interacting;data gathering;data-intensive analysis;disruptive technologies;healthcare;human expert;identity resolution;intelligent service platform;machine intelligence;prescriptive analytics modules;reasoning;science and technology;text mining","","","","","","","","3-6 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of healthcare remote technology may allow reducing most of the management of the chronic diseases meanwhile it may also contribute to the improvement of elderly people's quality of life. Unfortunately, despite the advent of Internet of things and the even decreasing price of sensors, current proposals are not extensible during runtime meaning that they need to be maintained offline by engineers. Therefore, in this paper we discuss how to build an ad-hoc extensible (during runtime) healthcare monitoring system by using low cost wireless sensors and already existent Internet of things technology as communication platform. Moreover, we present a prototype of a basic healthcare remote monitoring system, which alerts, in real time, patients' relatives or medical doctors that an elderly people is experienced a problem that could need medical attention or hospitalization.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9817-6; POD:978-1-4673-9818-3","10.1109/SCCC.2015.7416592","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7416592","healthcare;internet-of-things;wireless sensor network","Intelligent sensors;Logic gates;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computerised monitoring;diseases;health care;patient monitoring;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks","Internet of things;IoT-aware healthcare monitoring system;adhoc extensible healthcare monitoring system;ageing related diseases;chronic diseases management;communication platform;elderly people quality of life;healthcare remote technology;hospitalization;low cost wireless sensors;medical attention","","2","","15","","","","9-13 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The connection of IoT to applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is common in order to propose practical solutions. Simultaneously, games are known to increase interest and motivation among students when they are designed with pedagogic intent. Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them. But as our application gathers information that are relevant for remediation, it is also a forward useful solution to doctors who are always busy and who might check the display of children without an actual meeting.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5952-5; POD:978-1-4799-5953-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417598","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417598","","Biomedical monitoring;Games;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Software;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;health care;wireless sensor networks","Internet Of Things;IoT;WSN;dyslexic children;medical care;wireless sensor networks","","","","24","","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intel is focused on gaining a foothold in the burgeoning mobile/IOT computing market. One of the unique challenges in this dynamic market is the aggressive time-to-market (TTM) requirement. In the past, the length of the silicon validation stage for Intel SoCs contributed to the company's inability to deliver products on time, taking up to two years for prior projects. To address this situation, the Devices System Validation group set a transformation goal to reduce time from first silicon to PRQ for base and derivative products. While a validation execution strategy can be optimized based on perceived risk in changes to HW, FW, and SW, accounting for silicon debug is far more difficult. It is nearly impossible to predict the amount of time necessary to debug the breadth and quantity of issues (Sightings) that will be found during execution. The number of sightings generated over the course of a project depends on many factors, including the health of the RTL and process, the stability of the FW and SW code base, and the technical strength of the execution team. This unpredictability results in many challenges when attempting to hit a target time window from first silicon to Production Ready Quality (PRQ). Moorefield, a platform based on Intel's 22 nm Atom-based SoC named Anniedale, was the first project to achieve a goal of first silicon to Production in two quarters. A major factor in this achievement was the strategy employed by the team to manage the risk in silicon validation and debug with aggressive shift left effort that included early and close collaboration with the customer, platform, and design teams. This strategy is built on several key pillars. 1) Comprehensive Design for Debug (DFD) features and tools that are fully validation in pre-silicon & emulation to prepare for critical debug scenarios at customer platforms. 2) Early and close engagement with the lead customer and platform teams to develop an alpha level quality- SW in emulation. 3) Employing requirements-based validation to focus on validating only the form factor OS application use-cases. 4) A strict platform regressions strategy that can be scaled from pre to post silicon 5) Centralized System Debug organization to accelerate time to closure of critical sightings. In this talk we will be detailing and presenting the innovative strategies the System Validation (SV) organization took around the these pillars to achieve a successful launch of the Moorefield-based Asus tablet and phone in record breaking time.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9994-4; POD:978-1-4673-9995-1; USB:978-1-4673-9993-7","10.1109/IDT.2015.7396728","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396728","DFD;SOC;emulation;shift-left;system validation","Decision support systems","notebook computers;program debugging;quality control;risk management;system-on-chip","Anniedale SoC;Atom-based SoC;DFD feature;Devices System Validation group;IOT computing market;Intel SoC;Intel approach;Internet-of-Things;Moorefield platform;Moorefield-based Asus tablet;PRQ;SV organization;TTM requirement;customer engagement;design-for-debug feature;form factor OS application use-cases;mobile computing market;operating systems;platform regression strategy;production ready quality;requirements-based validation;risk management;silicon debug;system validation;system-on-chip;time-to-market requirement","","","","","","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This raises the question how the resources provided by the devices can be efficiently managed and provisioned. Related concepts like on-demand provisioning, elasticity, or resource pooling and sharing are already known from the Cloud Computing domain. This paper presents the Device Cloud approach, which aims at mitigating the IoT resource management issues by applying Cloud Computing concepts to the IoT domain. Similar to the Pay-as-you-Go paradigm, the Device Cloud allows users to allocate devices from a shared resource pool on-demand.

Unquestionably, emergence of IoT (Internet of things) technology contributes to the development of medical healthcare informatization. Yet, it is widely researched and accepted that privacy protection has become a bottleneck of smart medical healthcare nowadays. Consequently, how to protect the privacy of users' information in a smart healthcare system remains a pending problem. Under this background, this paper analyses the main problems in current smart healthcare system. Furthermore, a lightweight private homomorphism algorithm and an encryption algorithm improved from DES are designed when considering the characteristic of IoT and privacy protection. Finally, based on the above, we designed and completed a prototype system based on both software and hardware.","2168-3042;21683042","Electronic:978-1-4673-9117-7; POD:978-1-4673-9118-4","10.1109/PAAP.2015.48","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387328","IoT;WSN;encryption;private homomorphism;smart healthcare system","Algorithm design and analysis;Encryption;Medical services;Physiology;Privacy;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cryptography;data protection;health care;medical information systems","China medical healthcare system;DES;Internet of things technology;IoT technology;clinical informatization phase;encryption algorithm;lightweight private homomorphism algorithm;medical healthcare informatization;pervasive informatization phase;smart medical healthcare;user information privacy protection","","4","","15","","","","12-14 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7910-6; POD:978-1-4673-7911-3; USB:978-1-4673-7909-0","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380509","Android App;Android Smartphones;Mean Shift Algorithm;Patients with diabetes;RGB color evaluation","Algorithm design and analysis;Diabetes;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Smart phones;Wounds","cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones","Android App;Android smartphone;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;caregivers;chronic ulcer image analysis;diabetic patient;diabetic ulcers;flexible wound assessment system;healing status;high-resolution digital camera;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;skin color;visual examination;wound assessment;wound image analysis system;wound size","","1","","9","","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blood centers collect, process and transport blood to hospitals and other health care centers. Sometimes blood is collected directly from blood donors rather than taking it from blood bank. Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases.

The Certificateless signature (CLS) scheme is probably used to uniquely meet the security demands in WBAN. With the help of CLS, the security is assigned by private keys given to the patient. Because of that it is impossible for the third party or the attacker to access the private information of particular session.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7910-6; POD:978-1-4673-7911-3; USB:978-1-4673-7909-0","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380616","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380616","Disease detection through Sensors;Health recovery;Private information Security;WBAN","Biomedical monitoring;Body area networks;Cryptography;Monitoring;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","body area networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","CLS scheme;WBAN services;certificateless remote anonymous authentication technique;certificateless signature scheme;healthcare service;light-weight authentication protocol;private keys;security protocols;telemedicine system;wireless body area networks","","","","17","","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment.

The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363124","","Computers;Conferences;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing","Internet of Things;health care;public key cryptography","DTLS session resumption technique;IoT;end-to-end security;energy performance evaluations;healthcare Internet-of-Things;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;remote end-users;remote patient monitoring prototype;security context;session resumption technique;smart gateways","","3","","22","","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been considered and applied to model and demonstrate the flexibility and variability of the activities that involved in healthcare process. However, with the growing usage of digital information and IoT technology in the healthcare system, the issue of information security and privacy becomes the main concern in term of both store and management of electronic health record (EHR). Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place. BPMN is lacking of the ability to model and present security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a suitable way. This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult.

Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8321-9; POD:978-1-4673-8077-5","10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7331376","Approximate Computing;Biomedical Healthcare;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT;Wearable Devices","Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Encoding;Histograms;Medical services;Monitoring","biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring","Huffman table;battery-operated wearable devices;biosignal compressor;compression technique;energy supply;hardware resources;ultralow-power design;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable device energy consumption;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;wireless communication","","2","","32","","","","4-9 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service.

This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology.

A Raspberry Pi, a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) device, is responsible for sensing the temperature and streaming it to a server, the readings then are displayed in a mobile android application. For this system, a python application was developed to sense and stream the temperature, a servlet was developed to read and store the temperature in a SQLite database, and a mobile Android application was developed to read and display the temperature readings from the server. The initial versions of the project used the SoC device as a server (storing temperature readings into a local SQLite database), and both the SoC device and the mobile device needed to be connected in a local area network. However, the project was further developed to separate the server responsibilities from the SoC device. The system now supports user authentication, and both devices are connected through the Internet. This implementation allows the temperature readings to be viewed and displayed anytime from anywhere in the world since the database is hosted on a server which can be accessed over the internet. Also, this solution allows multiple SoC devices to stream temperatures to the server, to different mobile clients using the same database. The Android client application was also implemented to graphically show the temperature readings recorded by Raspberry Pi using Restful architecture. Moreover, an alert message notification was implemented in Android application so that a user is notified whenever the temperature reading reaches the preset threshold. On the other hand, the smart chair system has brilliant commercial prospects, which can be helpful to build health care products with the help of wearable sensors, intelligent refrigerator/oven temperature tracking system and etc.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6564-2; POD:978-1-4673-6565-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.261","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273411","Internet of Things;Python;RESTful API;Raspberry Pi;Temperature Tracking","Androids;Databases;Humanoid robots;Servers;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors;Web services","Android (operating system);Internet;Internet of Things;SQL;client-server systems;system-on-chip;temperature sensors","Internet of Things-based temperature tracking system;Python application;Raspberry Pi;Restful architecture;SQLite database;SoC device;client-server architecture;health care products;intelligent refrigerator;local area network;mobile Android application;oven temperature tracking system;smart chair system;system-on-chip device;temperature sensing;user authentication;wearable sensors","","1","","23","","","","1-5 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the viewpoint of application development, ontology sharing is the most important to integrate services. This paper, the first step towards ontology sharing, defines the iKaaS data model as one that integrates data models used in all applications in the project. The data defined in the iKaaS data model is converted into RDF format and stored in the RDF database. The reasoning mechanism in semantic web allows the semantic integration of data and applications.

However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources.

This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people. This provides a huge space for developing and applying new business models.

However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI.

However, the future of WSNs based on sensors lies in the multiple application support and the aggregation of resources either in the form of hardware or software. To deal with the challenges of aggregation of sensors in the health care environment, virtualization of a sensor network is an evolving concept that enables aggregation of multiple independent heterogeneous sensor networks under one roof. In order to virtualize the sensors and networks, middleware layer role is the most dominant one. Furthermore, middleware for sensors poses the overhead challenges like processing time, memory utilization, sampling rate, delay, and power consumption. In this paper efforts have been put forward by proposing a middleware framework for sensor network that uses multi-threading technique that increases the sampling frequency and reduces the delay caused by the hardware abstraction layer that resides on top each sensor node.

This is due to a decline in beekeeping, and stagnant honey bee populations across the globe, due to, among other factors, pests and disease. Recent advances in the area of low power wireless sensor network technology can be applied to the beehive for a better understanding of the colony's condition. This combination of engineering and beekeeping has led to the emergence of Precision Beekeeping. One of the key metrics of the strength of a beehive is the weight of the colony. Changes in weight can accurately reflect the productivity of the colony, as well as its health and condition. This paper describes the development of a wireless platform weighing scales, for implementation as part of a smart beehive. A single point impact load cell was selected as the most appropriate load sensor and was integrated into the design of the scales. The final weighing system was interfaced via a high precision analogue to digital converter to an off-the-shelf processing platform enabled with a low power Zigbee radio, to allow for data transfer to the base station. An initial simulation of the scale's ability was carried out, using standard weights to simulate the brood chamber of a beehive and varying weight to mimic the production and consumption of honey. The results showed that the initial platform scale has a linear output characteristic. The analogue to digital converter was evaluated and the system was found to be able to detect changes in weight in the order of tens of grams. A power analysis of the system was also undertaken to confirm that the solution was suitable for remote, battery powered, deployments.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6974-9; POD:978-1-4673-6975-6","10.1109/ISSC.2015.7163763","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163763","Biological and physical sensors;Environmental monitoring;Internet of Things (IoT);Precision apiary;Precision weighing;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Computer architecture;Force;Semiconductor device measurement;Software;Strain;Weight measurement;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;analogue-digital conversion;balances;weighing;wireless sensor networks","analogue to digital converter;base station;colony condition;data transfer;linear output characteristics;load sensor;low power Zigbee radio;low power wireless sensor network technology;power analysis;precision beekeeping;single point impact load cell;smart beehive monitoring;smart wireless platform weighing scale;stagnant honey bee population","","0","","14","","","","24-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, Fog is used for offloading resource constrained devices. Our smart phone based service, known as Emergency Help Alert Mobile Cloud (E-HAMC) provides a quick way of notifying the relevant emergency dealing department, utilizing the services of Fog for offloading as well as pre-processing purposes. The service sends the location of incident and contacts the appropriate emergency dealing department automatically through already stored contact numbers. The emergency related information is then synchronized automatically from Fog to the Cloud, allowing further analysis and improvement in safety of the people and creates extended portfolio of services for the concerned authorities as well as the users.

These cannot be realized on the desired scale by large-area electronics alone. It is necessary to combine large-area electronics with high-performance, high-efficiency technologies, such as crystalline silicon CMOS, within hybrid systems. Scalable hybrid systems require rethinking the subsystem architectures from the start by considering how the technologies should be interfaced, on both a functional and physical level. To explore platform architectures along with the supporting circuits and devices, we consider as an application driver, a self-powered sheet for high-resolution structural health monitoring (of bridges and buildings).

However, physical and mental wellness indicators directly affect the output of the worker according to existing studies that illustrate the strong relationship between workplace conditions and productivity. Personal and environmental sensed data can inform smarter workplace design and operations to potentially increase productivity and benefit all stakeholders in the modern workplace. This paper introduces a project that will measure environmental variables and personal physical and mental parameters of employees in different office environments to determine correlations with productivity. In-vivo measurements are obtained via a combination of environmental sensor modules and personal monitoring devices that record the interplay between variables affecting comfort and productivity in a workplace. The office spaces included in the study vary in age, heating/cooling management systems and the internal environmental efficiency of the buildings' design. This paper presents the pilot study that obtained bio-metric data from body area network sensors for each participant and environmental data on the state for workplace including thermal, humidity and light measurements.

They enable data gathering across a wide range of domains and areas of interest from health service to environment monitoring, security, etc. Sensors are becoming cheaper, and as a result are being deployed in high density, at the same time; users' requirements of the network are changing frequently, they can even exceed the capabilities of the sensors in the network sometimes. The network is expected to operate for a long period of time with many nodes operating on batteries. These challenges have raised the attention to the problem of mission assignment in WSNs. Mission assignment aims at allocating tasks to specific sensors in the network -according to their capabilities-to answer users requirements while at the same time preserving the energy of the network. This paper approaches the problem of mission assignment from a geospatial perspective: because sensors' readings and data are associated with spatial properties of the sensors like their location and sensing range; spatial reasoning is an important aspect of mission assignment. However, spatial reasoning is still very limited in WSNs and has not received much attention because of the lack of standardized modelling of space.

Connectivity of miniaturized wearable sensors of the body area network (BAN) to the Internet is one of the most important issues in realizing mobile healthcare system. Interoperability is also important in order for sensor data not to be isolated in a local system. In this paper, we designed our mobile healthcare system resolving connectivity and interoperability issues. In our mobile healthcare system, body sensors are integrated by leveraging RESTful web service via CoAP over IPv6, enabling web-based access from browsers. Extended EPCglobal architecture was used for our system to enable sharing of sensor data among applications with different domain through the standardized protocol.

In the diverse kinds of networks, wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN construction scheme that is consists of 4 operations, the clustered topology setup, mobility support, and transmission efficiency enhancement.

To reduce these issues the platform integrates the fast, easy-to-use, safe and low-power Near Field Communication protocol for data transmission in proximity, addressing the Internet of Things paradigm. The platform uses the Arduino NANO board and the related open source software libraries, so it could be possible to add new functionalities in a fast way. The first prototype of the platform has been customized for human body temperature measurement by using the digital TMP100 temperature sensor.

By allowing mobile users to interact with potential friends around the real world, it enables new social interactions as a complement to web-based online social networks. In this paper, we introduce a secure friend discovery mechanism based on encounter history in mobile social networks. By exploring the fact that sharing encounters indicate common activities and interests, our scheme can help people make friends with like-minded strangers nearby. We provide peer-to-peer confidential communications with the location privacy and encounter privacy being strictly preserved. Unlike most existing works that either rely on a trusted centralized server or existing social relationships, our algorithm is designed in an ad-hoc model with no such limitation. As a result, our design is more suitable and more general for mobile social scenarios. Extensive theoretical analysis and experimental study are conducted, and the results indicate that our scheme is feasible and effective for privacy-preserving friend discovery in mobile social networks.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8003-1; POD:978-1-4799-8004-8","10.1109/IIKI.2014.64","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064046","Mobile social networks;encounter;location privacy;secure friend discovery","Cryptography;History;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Privacy;Servers;Social network services","Internet;data privacy;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;social networking (online)","Web-based online social networks;ad-hoc model;encounter history;encounter privacy;location privacy;mobile devices;mobile social networking;peer-to-peer confidential communications;privacy-preserving friend discovery;secure friend discovery mechanism","","1","","18","","","","17-18 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More other diseases such as chickenpox, malaria, etc. are also serious threat to people's physical and mental health. Therefore proper techniques for disease surveillance are highly demanded. Recently, social media analysis is regarded as an efficient way to achieve this goal, which is feasible since growing number of people post their health information to social media such as blogs, personal website, etc. Previous work on social media analysis mainly focused on English materials but hardly considered Chinese materials, which hinders the use of such technique for Chinese people. In this paper, we proposed a new method of Chinese social media analysis for disease surveillance. More specifically, we compared different kinds of methods in the process of classification, and then proposed a new way to process Chinese text data. The Chinese Sina micro-blog data collected from September to December 2013 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that a high classification precision of 87.49% in average is obtained.

These pipelines are often subject to failures like erosion, sabotage and theft, causing high financial, environmental and health risks. Therefore, detecting leakages, estimating its size and location is very important. Current pipeline monitoring systems needs to be more automated, efficient and accurate methods for continuous inspection/reporting about faults. For this purpose, several pattern recognition and data mining techniques have been brought into the research community. In light of the issues of low efficiency and high false alarm rates in traditional pipeline condition monitoring, in this paper, we have used negative pressure wave (NPW) coupled with intelligent machine learning techniques integrated in distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) to identify specific events beased on raw data gathered by individual sensor nodes.

Traditional computer games and virtual reality (VR) environments focus on operability and the immersive experience. Controller devices are used to communicate from the real world with the virtual world. The usability of control methods affect the immersive experience of the users. Recently, many of these VR environments have adopted motion sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect sensors) Motion sensors can measure the user's movements and gestures to input control parameters for the virtual world and a self-avatar. Motion sensor-based games can help users to become more active and take steps to advance their health. Biological information, such as heart rate, body temperature, and muscle fatigue change depending on exercise volume. In this paper, we use a real-time biological information feedback to synchronize the user and the avatar representation. For instance, the color of the avatar changes according to the skin temperature of the user's face. We hypothesize that this representation method will motivate user activities, and improve the immersive experience. We implement a Scarecrow prototype using a streaming server for measurements of the user's behaviors and a front-end exercise game. We also perform an early user study to report the user experience and discuss the effects of the proposed method. We discuss the potential of the Scarecrow, which might encourage human exercise activities, and control human biological information.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5967-9; POD:978-1-4799-5968-6","10.1109/iThings.2014.66","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059691","Avatar Interaction;Biological Information Feedback;Immersive Experience","Avatars;Games;Heart rate;Skin;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","avatars;computer games","Scarecrow;VR environments;avatar color;avatar representation method;body temperature;computer games;controller devices;exercise volume;front-end exercise game;gestures;heart rate;human biological information;human exercise activities;immersive experience;motion sensor-based games;muscle fatigue change;real-time biological information feedback;self-avatar;skin temperature;streaming server;user activities;user behaviors;user face;user movements measurement;virtual reality;virtual world","","0","","34","","","","1-3 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence the networks must exclude the faulty devices or faulty sensors to ensure the network Quality of Service (QoS). Fault detection is highly preferred on machine-to-machine communication networks. Device fault can be divided into two types: hard fault and soft fault. We will give a mechanism with capability to detect and distinguish soft fault devices.

To solve this problem, we put forward an experimental model with two layer wireless links to facilitate human motion recognition.

Considering that the Android operating system allows data storage, connectivity, Web browser, media support, development environment, we propose to develop an application that will come in support to any patient who is suffering from hypotension/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or other metabolic diseases associated, and even more for patients with vision impairments who are unable to be independent. With the help of such application the patients and physicians can monitor measured values of blood pressure, values of blood glucose, weight, body mass index, cholesterol, etc., having the possibility of creating a database and a medical history, in which the values specified by the medical devices are stored on the smartphone using Bluetooth™ technique. In this paper we developed an application on the Android platform which aims at recording data measured (SBP - Systolic Blood Pressure, DBP - Diastolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate) by the electronic sphygmomanometer which communicates using Bluetooth™ technique. The application offers the possibility of transmitting medical data via mobile Internet or wireless.

Most of these devices are also connected to the Internet. However, the full capabilities of these devices are not fully harnessed and thus, they are not as intelligent as they could be. These devices, together with the Internet, can be used as “Internet of Things” where each device can be both producer and consumer of information. This framework is realizable in a real dynamic system if there is an intelligent distributed layer above it which can cater to services of all heterogeneous devices as required. The existing solutions to this problem are either too hardware dependent, or too abstract. In this paper we present a concept of this layer using mobile agents which makes the system flexible and dynamically adaptable. This layer has been deployed using a publicly available Prolog-based mobile agent emulator (however, any other mobile agent framework can also be used). The proposed approach is capable of updating information like availability and usability of services dynamically. It also has speech processing modules to provide solutions using voice-based commands and prompts. The prototype is scalable and robust to partial network failures. The implementation details and performance analysis of this work are reported and discussed. This framework can be used to deploy systems which can enable people to search for services like health facilities, food services, transportation, law and order using a common interface including voice commands.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6629-5; POD:978-1-4799-6630-1; USB:978-1-4799-6628-8","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019766","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019766","Distributed System;IoT;Mobile Agents;Services;Smart City","Cities and towns;Fires;Internet of Things;Mobile agents;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;PROLOG;computer network reliability;mobile agents;smart cities;speech processing","Internet;Internet of Things;Prolog-based mobile agent emulator;dynamic adaptability;flexible system;heterogeneous devices;intelligent distributed layer;mobile agents-based IoT;partial network failure;smart city;speech processing module;voice-based commands;voice-based prompts","","3","","15","","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The expectations indicate that not only human will be connected but also devices and machines will be connected communicating altogether through the Mobile broadband technology. These tremendous improvements in telecom will introduce new and innovative services that touch every small detail of people's life. Consequently, telecom networks will become more complex, involve more resources, and demand more requirements. Thus, network optimization will be crucial to avoid wasting the resources and ensure service availability and network efficiency. To help achieving that, network operators require intelligent methods to understand the ongoing traffic and services characteristics in order to control and forecast the live/ongoing traffic.

"An On-Demand WebRTC and IoT Device Tunneling Service for Hospitals","T. Sandholm; B. Magnusson; B. A. Johnsson","HP Labs., Palo Alto, CA, USA","2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","20141215","2014","","","53","60","In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4357-9; POD:978-1-4799-4356-2","10.1109/FiCloud.2014.19","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984175","iot;medical applications;palcom;rtc;webrtc","Browsers;Hospitals;Logic gates;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Standards;WebRTC","Internet;Internet of Things;biomedical equipment;firewalls;health care;hospitals;internetworking;wireless LAN","NAT;VPN solutions;WebRTC gateway service;WebRTC traffic;ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic;concurrent streams;direct browser-to-browser connection;external machines;home-care deployments;hospital firewall;local WiFi network;local gateway services;local home network;local hospital network;medical devices;on-demand IoT device tunneling service;on-demand WebRTC service;tunnel sensor","","4","","22","","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to improve its scalability and reliability at the same time shorten user access time, the multiple data replica scheme should be adopted and the proper location for each replica should be determined. In this paper, a multiple data replica placement scheme for cloud storage under health-care IoT environment is proposed. It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica. We have implemented the proposed scheme based on CloudSim and have done performance evaluation. Simulation results have shown that it can not only improve user access time and promote load balance but also enhance system scalability and reliability.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5148-2; POD:978-1-4799-5149-9","10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980892","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980892","IoT;MOX;SA;cloud storage;multiple data replica;replica placement","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Mathematical model;Medical services;Optimization;Software algorithms;Vectors","Internet of Things;cloud computing;health care;medical administrative data processing;replicated databases;resource allocation;simulated annealing;storage management","CloudSim;MOX algorithm;SA algorithm;cloud storage system;data replica placement scheme;health care data;healthcare IoT environment;load balancing;medical data;mosquitoes oviposition mating algorithm;optimal data replica placement solution;optimization objective;p-median model;research and development;simulated annealing algorithm;system reliability;system scalability;user access request assignment","","1","","9","","","","19-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing methods of manual measurement for battery or online battery monitoring system will require complicated wire connection and they are somehow risky during measurement. Meanwhile these operations will also require very professional personnel. Therefore, their applications have big limitation. This paper is to introduce a new type of battery and corresponding measurement (we named it as “Intelligent Battery”). We will apply new methods to measure battery condition using the communication way of power line carrier (PLC). This way of measurement will require a redesigning of storage battery which will bring revolutionary changes to battery and battery measurement. And this will become the footstone for building Internet of Things, a smarter way of battery maintenance and management. Users will have a real time monitor for battery.

But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option. In this paper, a fuzzy assisted data gathering and alert scheme is proposed for healthcare services. Thus unnecessary waste of energy by transmission of unnecessary information is avoided.

One of the key components for IoT based mobile healthcare is an accurate, low-cost, and user-friendly physiological monitoring device. In this study, such an intelligent, unobtrusive conformable, user friendly physiological monitoring device is presented. In particular, the inkjet printing of silver nano-particle ink, NPS-JL from Harima Chemicals, is used to fabricate interconnections and a 2.4 GHz antenna on low-cost stretchable plastics. Interconnections between RF SoC and passive components are made with isotropic conductive adhesive. Finally, the platform is demonstrated as a `plaster' like sensor node that measures the ECG signal and transmits that in real-time to a mobile device using Bluetooth low-energy protocol.

Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems.

A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners.

With the introduction of Google Glass, Epson Moverio, Pebble, and Fitbit, wearables have certainly captured the attention of many consumers and enterprises. While some of these wearables mainly provide a single function, such as fitness tracking, health monitoring, and message display, others have taken on the integration of multiple functions in the same device; the BASIS watch, for example, combines time, fitness, and health-monitoring functions into a single device. According to a new market report published by Transparency Market Research, “Wearable Technology Market-Global Scenario, Trends, Industry Analysis, Size, Share and Forecast, 2012-2018,? the global wearable technology market is expected to grow from US$750 million in 2012 to US$5.8 billion in 2018. U.K.-based Juniper Research projects that the number of wearable devices shipped will rise from about 13 million in 2013 to 130 million in 2018, and the size of the market will jump from US$1.4 billion in 2013 to US$19 billion in 2018. Business Insider Intelligence projects shipments of 100 million units in 2014 and forecasts the market will ultimately be worth about US$12 billion per year.

Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services.

The developed WSN system achieved requirements of SHM applications, i.e. 128 Hz sampling rate with tri-axial acceleration data within one sensor node. By acquired data, the developed system can make the prediction of structure status. In addition, a local-data-processing node and algorithm was also implemented to promote usability of WSN system in SHM applications.

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803112","Body Area Networks;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage","Decision support systems;Internet","body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks","bandwidth consumption;healthcare;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;power consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;statistical techniques;wireless human gait monitoring system","","0","","5","","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new e-Health platform driven by the needs of integrated diabetes care management. Architecture of this platform that is designed to be consistent with the concepts of Web-of-Things (WoT) comprises a physical sensors layer linked to a health Web-portal layer via an existing network infrastructure. The physical layer incorporates wireless nodes; each of which comprises a set of medical sensors linked wirelessly to a humanoid robot. Unlike existing e-Health systems, the proposed system is designed to support self-management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) not only through remote data collection and monitoring of patients data, but also through offering a support platform for real-time decisions and long-term social and behavioral change. These support services are delivered to the patients over a distance through daily patient-robot interactions that are either automatically generated be the system or assigned by specialist physicians. A prototype e-health platform which incorporates all these healthcare attributes is designed, implemented, and its end-to-end functionality is tested successfully with the aid of NHS collaborators.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2303-8; POD:978-1-4799-3676-2","10.1109/AEECT.2013.6716427","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6716427","Behavioural change support;Web-of-Things (WoT);diabetes;mobile health;patient monitoring","Browsers;Diabetes;Monitoring;Portals;Robots;Sugar","Internet of Things;diseases;health care;human-robot interaction;humanoid robots;medical robotics;patient care;portals;sensors;service robots;social aspects of automation","NHS collaborators;T1DM;Web-of-Things inspired e-health platform;WoT;end-to-end functionality;health Web-portal layer;health care systems;humanoid robot;integrated diabetes care management;long-term behavioral change;long-term social change;medical sensors;network infrastructure;patient data monitoring;patient-robot interactions;physical layer;physical sensor layer;prototype e-health platform;real-time decisions;remote data collection;type 1 diabetes mellitus self-management;wireless nodes","","9","","25","","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, the use of wireless sensors to capture physiological data from patients for long term health monitoring is becoming increasingly popular although some previous studies recorded complaints from users about discomfort when wearing these. In addition, these systems can sometimes suffer from interference from existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is both comfortable to use and does not encounter interference with existing wireless traffic is required. This paper presents a system design that includes a probe, sensor, radio, and receiver for a long term heart rate monitoring in a senior center. This system has been deployed in a senior center since May 2012, and 63 seniors have used this system in this period. The senior center has its own wireless network, and no changes were made to this.

Thus, Weibo plays a social sensor role to surveill people's health status. By exploring more than 35.3 million tweets from Sina Weibo, we first filter the data according to the ILI (Influenza like Illness ) definition and compare the online social network data with the statistics summery of China CDC (Center of Disease Control and Prevention) using cosine similarity and the standard deviation metrics.

In this paper, we introduced the design and development of a wireless router which also integrated atmospheric Pressure, Humidity and Temperature (P-H-T) sensing functions for the body area network to relay different kinds of physiological signals from a comparatively further place. The standout advantages of the wireless router we designed can be summarized as the following 4 points: 1. High network throughput rate: the network throughput rate could be as high as 73.6Kbytes/s when the data transmitted through three jumps; 2. Low packet loss rate: the packet loss rate is just 0.4% when date transmitted 50 meters through three jumps; 3. High transmission power: to enhance the wireless communication capability, wireless power amplifier is applied and the transmission power of the router can be up to 20dBm; 4. Multi-functions: besides the relay function, the router could also perform the P-H-T environment monitoring function. In this paper, we mainly introduced the design and implementation of the zigbee router, and then we described the experiments done on the network performance and the health and environment monitoring function.

The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided.

"Towards u-health: An indoor 6LoWPAN based platform for real-time healthcare monitoring","F. Touati; R. Tabish; A.

A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5616-9; POD:978-1-4673-5615-2","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548958","6LoWPAN;IEEE802.15.4;U-Healthcare;WBAN;WSN","Accelerometers;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Protocols;Real-time systems;Temperature sensors","Internet of Things;biomedical communication;health care;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing","IEEE802.15.4;Internet of Things;Labview program;TCP client;TCP/IP;Zigbee;bluetooth;communication platform;edge router;gateway application;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;interoperability problem;next generation u-healthcare system;real-time healthcare monitoring;real-time monitoring;remote PC;smart devices;u-healthcare systems;ubiquitous healthcare","","9","","15","","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover.

Two routing schemes are used in 6LoWPAN depending on which layer takes routing, forwarding decisions. If adaptation layer takes the decision, then it is called mesh under, whereas if the network layer is involved, then the scheme is route over. In this paper, we present a comparative study of these two schemes. Various performance metrics, such as average round-trip time delay, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio are compared and suitability of the two schemes are analyzed for a Sensor-Grid infrastructure.

These Smart Things are destined to manage the security of our houses, watch our health, and optimize the energy consumption of our cities. They bring a new set of opportunities, but they also present high challenges regarding scalability, management, bootstrapping, identity verification and authentication. For that reason, this work is focused on addressing the security requirements for Smart Things providing an optimized family of primes for Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC), denominated Shifting Primes. ECC on Smart Things needs special optimizations for the cryptographic primitives that requires a precise study of the instruction set and the number of cycles for those instructions. The modular multiplication is the basic operation, critical for highly constrained microprocessors, in terms of which ECC is built. It is optimized and also analyzed the interaction between partial results in the chain of modular multiplications needed for ECC. This optimizations have been carried out over the MSP430, which is a widely extended microprocessor for Smart Things. MSP430 is featured by not offering hardware multiplier. For that reason, we have defined a special kind of prime numbers, the Shifting Primes. They are featured by offering a very fast multiplication algorithm for ECC through addition and shifting operations for the multiplications. It is presented the full faster multiplication algorithm for Shifting Primes. These results are presenting a lowest time and number of operations for the multiplication in ECC than the existing solutions. Finally, note that the presented primes can be applied also to other similar architectures with fast shifting operation on registers.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4684-1; POD:978-1-4673-1328-5","10.1109/IMIS.2012.199","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296955","Elliptic Curve Cryptography;Internet of Things;Montgomery Multiplication;Point Representation;Shifting Primes","Elliptic curve cryptography;Hardware;Manganese;Optimization;Registers","Internet;public key cryptography","ECC;Internet;MSP430;constrained microprocessors;energy consumption;hardware multiplier;optimizing elliptic curve cryptography;shifting primes;smart things","","4","","14","","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing communication solutions are however limited in this respect, because of centralized application-level communication. In response to this, we presents a distributed communication solution for mHealth applications which circumvents these limitations. Our Internet-of-Things architecture enables mHealth applications to utilize information from sensors and wireless sensor networks via a peer-to-peer overlay, where sensor information is organized in an information model which is stored in the overlay itself.

The potential of such a change is still to be fully exploited, and phenomena such as social networks and cloud computing are just two of the many innovative solutions that have been born from the Web 2.0. At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality.

How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4580-6; POD:978-1-4577-1976-9","10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.90","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142189","healthcare;save live;smartphone","Diseases;Fluids;Global Positioning System;Home appliances;Sensors;Smart phones;Vehicles","Global Positioning System;alarm systems;biomedical communication;gyroscopes;health care;patient monitoring;radiocommunication;sensors;smart phones","GPS coordinates;GPS positions;ambulance;bodily position;calories;defibrillator;driver indisposition;fluid;gyroscope;hazard warning flasher;healthcare;jogging;life-saving information;measured data;momentary state of health;patient condition;pedals;portable sensors;pulse counter;smartphones;sphygmograph;standing;steering wheel;travelling;walking;wireless communication","","1","","12","","","","19-22 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CPS systems are rapidly becoming an important development strategies with broad application domains. The key requirements for CPS systems are to support multiple applications with many different resources at the same time in timeliness and also ensure energy efficiency. This paper presents the Cyber-Physical integrated cloud computing system called Cyber-Physical Cloud (CPC) to solve these key requirements. CPC architecture is designed for various applications such as health care, smart cars, traffic control, etc where multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) communicate with each other through mobile ad hoc network. Concurrently, CPC architecture can leverage cloud computing to process effectively computation and resource management by virtualization technique. Moreover, CPS systems are built on heterogeneous WSNs to collect and process the physical objects by obtaining data and thereafter processing queries. As a part of CPS systems, the key requirement for WSNs is to sustain a long lifetime because of limited power supplies. We work on real time preemptive query scheduling in WSNs with a focus on quality of data (QoD) to analysis useful energy consumption and interference energy consumption. We propose the Energy efficiency Aware Quality of Data (EAQD) method that runs on real time preemptive query scheduling to find the expected QoD for each query thus enabling energy consumption minimization. EAQD method also computes the transmitting/receiving slots needed for each query to avoid wasting slots. The simulation results show the our approach can reduce energy consumption up to 5 times as compares to previous approaches.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4580-6; POD:978-1-4577-1976-9","10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.61","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142278","cyber-physical systems;energy efficiency;quality of data;real time query scheduling","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cloud computing;energy conservation;health care","CPC architecture;CPS system;EAQD method;cloud computing;computation world;convergence;cyber physical system;cyber-physical cloud;energy consumption minimization;energy efficiency;health care;interference energy consumption;mobile ad hoc network;quality of data;real physical world;real time preemptive query scheduling;smart car;traffic control;virtualization;wireless sensor network","","4","","31","","","","19-22 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information will be presented by virtual reality means, when the true presentation of technological scene with suitably presented information is at user's disposal. The user is not only a mere scene observer but, thanks to the interactive functions of virtual environment; he/she will become a part of this scene. In this way, the amount of information that the dispatcher or manager is able to accept and correctly and easily understand, and that forms the knowledge base for his/her decision making will increase. Just support to decision making processes is the area to which significant benefit can be brought. This kind of systems will allow getting support to decision making not only in the common mode of operation, but especially in the mode of crisis management when dealing with extraordinary events.

Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6271-1; POD:978-1-4244-6270-4","10.1109/ITNG.2010.104","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501633","Near Field Communication (NFC);Pervasive Healthcare;RFID;Telemedicine;eHealth","Ambient intelligence;Communications technology;Decision making;IP networks;Medical services;Pervasive computing;Radiofrequency identification;Safety;Senior citizens;Web and internet services","Internet;handicapped aids;health care","Internet of things;KIT technology;ambient assisted living;closed loop healthcare services;keep in touch;near field communication;people-to-people communication;radio frequency identification;smart homes;technological advancements;telemonitoring processes","","98","3","16","","","","12-14 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol.

The m-health is currently bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare delivery and technology sectors. From the wireless communications perspective, the current decade is expected to bring the introduction of new wireless standards and network systems with true mobile broadband and fast internet access healthcare services. These will be developed around what is currently called the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. In this editorial paper, we will introduce the new and novel concept of 4G health that represents the long-term evolution of m-health since the introduction of the concept in 2004. The special section also presents a snapshot of the recent advances in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the evolved m-health perspective. It will also present some of the concepts that can go beyond the traditional “m-health ecosystem” of the existing systems.

First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1941-0; POD:978-1-5090-1942-7","10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457124","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457124","","","Internet of Things;body sensor networks;radio links;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things security;IoT security;M2M communication;data session;health infrastructure;link fingerprint matching;machine-2-machine communication;medical applications;symmetric spatiotemporal characteristics;wireless bodyworn sensing device security;wireless link;wireless sensor networking","","","","","","","","14-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
