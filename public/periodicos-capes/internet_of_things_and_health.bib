The goal of this extension is to develop augmented mirror worlds that represent a real and virtual world coupled, so that the virtual world not only reflects the real one, but also complements it. A new component called a smart resource artifact, that enables modelling and developing devices to access the real physical world, and a human in the loop agent to place a human in the system have been included in the meta-model and framework. The proposed extension of MAM5 has been tested by simulating a light control system where agents can access both virtual and real sensor/actuators through the smart resources developed. The results show that the use of real environment interactive elements (smart resource artifacts) in agent-based simulations allows to minimize the error between simulated and real system.",

abstract = "In recent years, safer and more reliable biometric methods have been developed. Apart from the need for enhanced security, the media and entertainment sectors have also been applying biometrics in the emerging market of user-adaptable objects/systems to make these systems more user-friendly. However, the complexity of some state-of-the-art biometric systems (e.g., iris recognition) or their high false rejection rate (e.g., fingerprint recognition) is neither compatible with the simple hardware architecture required by reduced-size devices nor the new trend of implementing smart objects within the dynamic market of the Internet of Things (IoT). It was recently shown that an individual can be recognized by extracting features from their electrocardiogram (ECG). However, most current ECG-based biometric algorithms are computationally demanding and/or rely on relatively large (several seconds) ECG samples, which are incompatible with the aforementioned application fields. Here, we present a computationally low-cost method (patent pending), including simple mathematical operations, for identifying a person using only three ECG morphology-based characteristics from a single heartbeat. The algorithm was trained/tested using ECG signals of different duration from the Physionet database on more than 60 different training/test datasets. The proposed method achieved maximal averaged accuracy of 97.450% in distinguishing each subject from a ten-subject set and false acceptance and rejection rates (FAR and FRR) of 5.710±1.900% and 3.440±1.980%, respectively, placing Beat-ID in a very competitive position in terms of the FRR/FAR among state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method can identify a person using an average of 1.020 heartbeats. It therefore has FRR/FAR behavior similar to obtaining a fingerprint, yet it is simpler and requires less expensive hardware. This method targets low-computational/energy-cost scenarios, such as tiny wearable devices (e.g., a smart object that automatically adapts its configuration to the user). A hardware proof-of-concept implementation is presented as an annex to this paper.",

The Internet of Things enabled applications will radically change the interactions between humans and the environment, thus security being a key-point of this ecosystem. One of the most important Internet of Things enabled scenarios is the smart city, this application having a direct impact on multiple social areas: smart lighting, smart roads, noise urban maps and many others. Smart city objects will interact with both humans and machines, implementing multiple communication protocols. Taking this into consideration, integrating smart city objects with social networks is a logical step, even though this idea implies multiple security issues and innovative big data processing systems. Social networks represent a platform where both machines and humans can exchange messages, being an information source and sink for the smart city objects. This paper presents a security architecture where social networks enable an adaptive sensing-as-a-service system. Smart city objects, which need additional information beside the one obtained from the sensors, collect it from the most trusted nodes on the social network. This system enables an autonomic computing mechanism where smart objects have a reputation built on the feedback received from both human and other nodes, a certain degree of trust being transferred to all the nodes which contributed to the publication of reliable information.",

Today, all aspects of our daily life, be it health of a person, his location, movement, etc. can be monitored and analyzed using information captured from various connected devices. This paper discusses one such use case, which can be implemented by the automobile industry, using technological advancements in the areas of IoT and Analytics. ‘Connected Car’ is a terminology, often associated with cars and other passenger vehicles, which are capable of internet connectivity and sharing of various kinds of data with backend applications. The data being shared can be about the location and speed of the car, status of various parts/lubricants of the car, and if the car needs urgent service or not. Once data are transmitted to the backend services, various workflows can be created to take necessary actions, e.g. scheduling a service with the car service provider, or if large numbers of care are in the same location, then the traffic management system can take necessary action. ’Connected cars’ can also communicate with each other, and can send alerts to each other in certain scenarios like possible crash etc. This paper talks about how the concept of ‘connected cars’ can be used to perform ‘predictive car maintenance’.

It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

Case study presented in this paper concern design of WSN in IoT concept from system lifetime perspective. A hierarchical routing technique, which shows energy efficiency, has been validated.

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients.

The introduction of a high level of wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects, providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary curved surface over their stiff counterparts without incurring damage, emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force, temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization), further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory, signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major research frontiers in recent years.

They include healthcare monitoring, industrial application, smart grid, home automation, and many energy-critical application suffered from limited resources. In response, many studies have proposed energy efficient solutions, however, they may waste energy as ever. It is because they do not consider the contentions in multi-coordinator environments then the frequent packet collisions are followed by retransmission which consumed unnecessary energy. In this respect, we proposed a new and simply implementable contention mitigation scheme to enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes by reducing the contention degree among neighboring coordinators. In the proposed scheme, the coordinators recognize the network state by exchanging their information with each other. It leads that the coordinators isolate the superframe duration by staggering own beacon transmission. It can alleviate significant contentions among burst packets at the beginning of the superframe. Therefore, the proposed scheme reduces a lot of unnecessary wasted energy in the process of redundant retransmission.

WSNs are integrated with the Internet Protocol (IP) to develop the Internet of Things (IoT) for connecting everyday life objects to the internet. Hence, major challenges of WSNs include: (i) how to efficiently utilize small size and low-power nodes to implement security during data transmission among several sensor nodes; (ii) how to resolve security issues associated with the harsh and complex environmental conditions during data transmission over a long coverage range. In this study, a secure IoT-based smart home automation system was developed. To facilitate energy-efficient data encryption, a method namely Triangle Based Security Algorithm (TBSA) based on efficient key generation mechanism was proposed. The proposed TBSA in integration of the low power Wi-Fi were included in WSNs with the Internet to develop a novel IoT-based smart home which could provide secure data transmission among several associated sensor nodes in the network over a long converge range. The developed IoT based system has outstanding performance by fulfilling all the necessary security requirements.

United Nations reports throughout recent years have stressed the growing constraint of food supply for Earth’s growing human population. Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO2, O2, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives.",

What are the most frequently obtained research artefacts? What does big data research produces? Who are the active authors? Which journals include papers on Big Data? What are the active disciplines? For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on eight dimensions, including the SMACIT (Social Mobile Analytics Cloud Internet of Things) perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a systematic mapping study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications. The results have shown that significant contributions have been made by the research community, attested by a continuous increase in the number of scientific publications that address Big Data. We found that researchers are increasingly involved in research combining Big Data and Analytics, Cloud, Internet of things, mobility or social media. As for quality objectives, besides an interest in performance, other topics as scalability is emerging. Moreover, security and quality aspects become important. Researchers on Big Data provide more algorithms, frameworks, and architectures than other artifacts. Finally, application domains such as earth, energy, medicine, ecology, marketing, and health attract more attention from researchers on big data. A complementary content analysis on a subset of papers sheds some light on the evolving field of big data research.",

The insights gained from this data are allowing for many industries to be more efficient and productive, putting more pressure on operations staff to ensure they are staying ahead of the curve. However, the industry that is being asked to store the most data is often overlooked. Surprisingly, it's not health care, retail, or government -- it's manufacturing. Internet-enabled connectivity of devices and analytical capabilities have pushed forward new models of manufacturing. The first Industrial Revolution was characterized by the mechanization of production using water and steam, the second by the introduction of mass production using electrical power, and the third by using information technology to automate production. However, most recently people entered into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is characterized by Internet-connected devices that enable a new level of Big Data and analytics.",

We present the first review on fog computing within healthcare informatics, and explore, classify, and discuss different application use cases presented in the literature. For that, we categorize applications into use case classes and list an inventory of application-specific tasks that can be handled by fog computing. We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud. These findings substantiate the need for a coherent approach toward fog computing in healthcare, for which we present a list of recommended research and development actions.",

It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board’s memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications.</p>",

The predictive production system is an intelligent manufacturing system where networked assets are equipped with self-awareness to predict, root cause, and reconfigure faulty events automatically. Cyber physical systems are one of the core enabling technologies within which information from all the related perspectives are analyzed and interconnected between physical factory floor and the cyber computational space. It intertwines with smart analytics to comprehend invisible issues for rapid decision making. In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed on how cyber physical systems can be applied to predictive production systems to inject resilience and interoperability so that the productivity of manufacturing can be optimized.

In 60% of the articles, the deployment architecture relied in the connective infrastructure associated with emergent technologies such as cloud services, distributed services, Internet-of-things, machine-to-machine, vehicular ad hoc network, and service-oriented architecture. In 40% of the literature review, the deployment architecture for mHealth considered traditional connective infrastructure. Only 20% of the studies implemented an energy consumption protocol to extend system lifetime. We concluded that there is a need for more integrated solutions specifically for outdoor scenarios.

abstract = "Healthcare concerns have become diverse, ranging from acute and chronic conditions to lifestyle, wellbeing and the prevention of illness. Increasingly, individuals are taking responsibility for monitoring their own conditions. Healthcare technologies are increasingly used not only for administration, but also in specialist treatments and many forms of monitoring, including when a person is mobile. As well as formal interactions with professional carers and results from specialist procedures, care may involve ad hoc interactions with an individual’s community. Together, these yield a wealth of data relevant in different contexts. Unfortunately, many existing healthcare systems are inflexible, single-purpose, and self-contained, so that we cannot fully realise their potential. We believe that a framework for flexible interoperability of healthcare-relevant components is crucial, in a time of increasing need from an ageing population. We present a vision of . To achieve this we believe that the application logic embodied in components should be separated from the policy that specifies where and how they should be used—which may be in ways not contemplated by their original designers. Middleware should therefore provide a framework that supports not only traditional communication among components but also dynamic reconfiguration of components in response to circumstances that arise, with the management and enforcement of high-level policy integrated with the middleware. By this means, functionality for patients, carers and health administrators can be customised and provided as, when and where required. This paper explores middleware requirements and challenges arising from technology- and population-driven developments in healthcare provision. We describe the specific requirements that middleware must address, and present some practical steps towards addressing these from the initial stages of a middleware (SBUS).",

Recently, the associations between lack of sleep and weight gain, development of cancer and many other health problems have been recognized. Then monitoring the sleep and wake state all night is becoming a hotspot issue. Traditionally it classified by a PSG recording which is very costly and uncomfortable. Nowadays, with the advance of internet of things, many convenient wearable devices are being used for medical use, like measuring the heart rate (HR), blood pressure and other signals. With the sleep quality monitor problem, the key question is how to discriminate the sleep and weak stage from these signals. This paper proposed a Bayesian approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW) method for sleep and wake classification. It used HR and surplus pulse O2 (SPO2) signals to analyze the sleep states and the occurrence of some sleep-related problems. DTW is an algorithm that searches an optimal alignment between time series with scaling and shifting and Bayesian methods have been successfully used for object classification in many study. In this paper, a three-step process is used for sleep and wake classification. In the first step, the DTW is used to extract features of the original HR and SPO2 signals. Then a probabilistic model is introduced for using the Bayesian classification for uncertain data. And in the classification step, the DTW features are used as the training dataset in the Bayesian approach for sleep and wake classification. Finally, a case study form a real-word applications, collected from the website of the Sleep Heart Health Study, is presented to shown the feasibility and advantages of the DTW-based Bayesian approach.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the health-care sector through remote, continuous, and non-invasive monitoring of patients. However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.",

In this paper, we present a fully printed sensor capable of noninvasive material thickness detection. By applying an oscillating signal between two millimeter-scale electrodes, the fringing electric field is measurably perturbed by a material placed directly on top of the electrodes, leading to a linearly varying capacitance with change in the material&#x2019;s thickness. We simulate this electric field perturbation and experimentally demonstrate the linear correlation between capacitance and overlying material thickness. Various parameters, from sensor size and structure to substrate and ink materials, are studied to optimize the performance of the printed sensors. Sensors made of metallic carbon nano-tube ink yield the best sensitivity, exhibiting a capacitance change of 26 fF per mm thickness of rubber&#x2014;ten times more sensitive than devices composed of silver nanoparticle ink. Finally, we demonstrate an effective application of the sensors in automobile tires. By applying the sensors directly beneath the tread (within the tire), mm changes in the tread depth are able to be detected in a 99&#x0025; confidence interval.

To indemnify the ecological and health concerns associated with the rise in CO2 levels, an important technology is GREEN communication. This paper presents a survey on various energy-efficient scenarios for green communication, involving device-to-device (D2D) communication, spectrum sharing, ultra-dense networks (UDNs), massive MIMO, millimeter wave networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). For improving the battery lifetime of user terminals in a network, a three-layer architecture is proposed, which emphasizes on transmitting information through relays, between a given pair of users. The susceptibility of security attack on relays is also enumerated. As security in the networks cannot be overlooked, secure power optimization is studied, and the possible security attack on users within the small cell access point (SCA) of the 5G networks is proposed. Some of the key research challenges in association to green communication and security have been discussed, and the ongoing projects and standardization activities also stated in the paper. Proposed attack on users within SCA of 5G network: The small cell access points (SCAs) form an important part of the 5G wireless communication network. When a mobile user switches between SCAs, at the instant of dropping connection from one SCA and associating with the other, intruder can spoof its authenticated information.fx1 •Rising carbon dioxide emissions with rise in power consumption levels.•Projection of carbon footprint, and its abatement in the years to come.•Proposed three-layer architecture, for prolonging battery lifetime of users, focusing the use of relays.•Possibility of attack on the relay being used for prolonging user terminal battery life.•Proposed intrusion attack on the users within the small cell access point (SCA).",

abstract = "The intrinsic variability of switching behavior in memristors has been a major obstacle to their adoption as the next generation of universal memory. On the other hand, this natural stochasticity can be valuable for hardware security applications. Here we propose and demonstrate a novel true random number generator utilizing the stochastic delay time of threshold switching in a Ag:SiO2 diffusive memristor, which exhibits evident advantages in scalability, circuit complexity, and power consumption. The random bits generated by the diffusive memristor true random number generator pass all 15 NIST randomness tests without any post-processing, a first for memristive-switching true random number generators. Based on nanoparticle dynamic simulation and analytical estimates, we attribute the stochasticity in delay time to the probabilistic process by which Ag particles detach from a Ag reservoir. This work paves the way for memristors in hardware security applications for the era of the Internet of Things. Memristors can switch between high and low electrical-resistance states, but the switching behaviour can be unpredictable. Here, the authors harness this unpredictability to develop a memristor-based true random number generator that uses the stochastic delay time of threshold switching",

Germanium and III-V compound semiconductors are being considered promising candidates for future high-performance processor generations and chips based on thin-film plastic technology or carbon nanotubes could allow for embedding electronic intelligence into arbitrary objects for the Internet-of-Things.

Firstly, a nonlinear Markov process is derived from a large number of big networks with weak interactions, where each big network is described as a continuous-time block-structured Markov process. Secondly, some effective algorithms are given for computing the fixed points of the nonlinear Markov process by means of the UL-type RG-factorization.

To solve this problem, several user authentication and key agreement schemes with a smart card and a password have been proposed in the past years. However, these schemes are vulnerable to some attacks such as offline password guessing attack, user impersonation attack by using attacker's own smart card, sensor node impersonation attack and gateway node bypassing attack. In this paper, we propose an improved scheme which can resist a wide variety of attacks in WSNs.

abstract = "New healthcare technologies are emerging with the increasing age of the society, where the development of smart homes for monitoring the elders’ activities is in the center of them. Identifying the resident’s activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12% improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition , which used dynamic segmentation. The f-measure metric demonstrated up to 12.73% improvement.",

abstract = "The IOT infrastructure - IP-based mobile sensor network- makes it possible to provide two-directional communication between mobile sensors and the remote server. Mobility direction prediction is a major challenge in IP-based networks by which we can predict the next movement direction of moving objects carrying mobile node(s). In this paper, we have introduced a Distributed Self-Healing Movement Prediction scheme for IOT applications, so-called DSHMP-IOT, to predict movement direction of mobile IP-based sensors in a multi-user environment, such as a health-care system. This is the first time that an AI solution is applied to predict the direction of the mobile node(s) in an IP-based mobile network. The proposed scheme takes advantage of Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) to predict the movement direction with high accuracy and low overhead. The previous works for estimating the direction of a mobile node(s) in IP-based mobile networks are based on AOA, a hardware-specific method. The proposed scheme has several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for special hardware (directional antenna, an antenna array, etc.) which is required in AOA based methods. Second, it is not sensitive to noise, speed and sudden changing of movement direction which cause false positive movement direction prediction in AOA method.

Barnes, said smart manufacturing, as embodied by 4.0 and Internet of Things, is really a digital transformation. If they look at the history of manufacturing, there are a few major transitions. Nesi added that you look back at the last 20 or 30 years, manufacturing has been looked upon as a labor intensive activity; and at the same time, the shipping costs. And when you stretch your supply chain out, while it's good for global trade and it's good for labor arbitrage, they're kind of past that point.",

Fueled by machine-to-machine (M2M) data, the Internet of Things promises to make our lives easier and better, from more efficient energy delivery and consumption to mobile health innovations where doctors can monitor patients from afar. However, the resulting tidal wave of machine-generated data streaming in from smart devices, sensors, monitors, meters, etc., is testing the capabilities of traditional database technologies. They simply can't keep up; or when they're challenged to scale, are cost-prohibitive. Google's Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen recently released The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business, which discusses an imminent future where everyone is connected. In a recent interview about the new book, the authors talked about the intersection of the {"}Internet of People{"} with the Internet of Things. We're living in a world that's not only more connected and more efficient but also more informed; machinegenerated data is helping us to better serve the people. The smart grid serves as another example. As Opower, a provider of energy usage and efficiency reports for utilities, continues to generate more and more data, it needs analytic solutions that can help it extract valuable business intelligence without breaking the bank on expensive hardware or database administration expenses. It is at the intersection between the Internet of Things and the Internet of People that Opower can turn data into true insight. Opower is able to quickly analyze behavioral, demographic and log data that shows, for example, which of its products are being leveraged most successfully by utilities and how utility customers interact with the information that Opower provides. * Flexible querying and ad hoc reporting. In fast-paced business and operational environments (smart grids are a great example), intelligence needs change quickly, so analytic tools can't be constrained by data schémas that limit the number and type of queries that can be performed. This deeper analysis requires a flexible solution that doesn't require a lot of {"}tinkering{"} or time-consuming manual configuration (such as indexing and managing data partitions) to create and change analytic queries.",

Specifically, the paper presents a composite subscription language CPSL and builds the corresponding Pub/Sub middleware Grus. The subscriptions in CPSL can specify diverse temporal, spatial and logical relationships of events, in particular, can describe the moving events related to mobile objects, and Grus is responsible for detecting whether events are matched with subscriptions in a distributed way. In addition, Grus provides the optimization strategies for subscriptions involving unary spatial operators. The paper also evaluates Grus's matching performance and costs through simulation experiments. The experimental results show that Grus can achieve satisfying performance and acceptable overheads, and the optimization strategies can efficiently speed up the detection of spatial events.

This makes us take safety measures to achieve a secure communication, where the interception of a message by a malicious user cannot compromise our privacy.This security encompasses a very broad concept that can be addressed in multiple ways.

Here we report a novel paradigm for sensing modulators: a graphene field-effect transistor device that directly modulates a radio frequency (RF) electrical carrier signal when exposed to chemical agents, with a memory effect in its electrochemical history. We demonstrated the concept and implementation of this graphene-based sensing modulator through a frequency-modulation (FM) experiment conducted in a modulation cycle consisting of alternating phases of air exposure and ethanol or water treatment. In addition, we observed an analog memory effect in terms of the charge neutrality point of the graphene, V cnp , which strongly influences the FM results, and developed a calibration method using electrochemical gate-voltage pulse sequences. This graphene-based multifunctional device shows great potential for use in a simple, low-cost, and ultracompact nanomaterial-based nodal architecture to enable continuous, real-time event-based monitoring in pervasive healthcare IoTs, ubiquitous security systems, and other chemical/molecular/gas monitoring applications.",

It creates different problems including environmental pollution and health problem and incurs a cost which is increasing through years. One-third of this congestion is created by cars searching for parking places. Drivers may be aware that parking places are fully occupied but will drive around hoping that a parking place may become vacant. Opportunistic services, involving learning, predicting, and exploiting Internet of Things scenarios, are able to adapt to dynamic unforeseen situations and have the potential to ease parking search issues. Hence, in this paper, a cooperative dynamic prediction mechanism between multiple agents for parking space availability in the neighborhood, integrating foreseen and unforeseen events and adapting for long-term changes, is proposed. An agent in each parking place will use a dynamic and time varying Markov chain to predict the parking availability and these agents will communicate to produce the parking availability prediction in the whole neighborhood. Furthermore, a learning approach is proposed where the system can adapt to different changes in the parking demand including long-term changes. Simulation results, using synthesized data based on an actual parking lot data from a shopping mall in Geneva, show that the proposed model is promising based on the learning accuracy with service adaptation and performance in different cases.",

These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms. Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems. By carefully analyzing the spatiotemporal workload characteristics of the NMPC problems, we propose the design of an efficient NoC architecture.

IoT enables network connectivity between smart devices at all times, everywhere, and about everything. In this context, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role in increasing the ubiquity of networks with smart devices that are low-cost and easy to deploy. However, sensor nodes are restricted in terms of energy, processing and memory. Additionally, low-power radios are very sensitive to noise, interference and multipath distortions. In this context, this article proposes a routing protocol based on Routing by Energy and Link quality (REL) for IoT applications. To increase reliability and energy-efficiency, REL selects routes on the basis of a proposed end-to-end link quality estimator mechanism, residual energy and hop count. Furthermore, REL proposes an event-driven mechanism to provide load balancing and avoid the premature energy depletion of nodes/networks. Performance evaluations were carried out using simulation and testbed experiments to show the impact and benefits of REL in small and large-scale networks. The results show that REL increases the network lifetime and services availability, as well as the quality of service of IoT applications. It also provides an even distribution of scarce network resources and reduces the packet loss rate, compared with the performance of well-known protocols.",

In this paper, we propose a novel distributed secure data management with keyword search system for health IoT. Since the patients are usually managed by diverse medical institutions, the proposed system enables distributed access control of protected health information (PHI) among different medical domains. On the other hand, the accumulation of electronic health records (EHR) makes effective data retrieval a challenge task. Our scheme could provide efficient keyword search function on cross-domain PHI. For the resource limited devices in health IoT, it is an essential requirement to design lightweight algorithms in the secure data management system. The proposed system realizes lightweight data encryption, lightweight keyword trapdoor generation and lightweight data recovery, which leaves very few computations to user's terminal. The security of this system is reduced to the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The comparison analysis is made between this scheme and other existing systems.

By synthesis of functional abstraction for configuration management and performance monitoring, an approach to design RESTful web services for mobile monitoring is suggested. In addition to traditional operations supported by Database Management Systems, web services' operations for subscription management and notifications about occurrences of specific data-related events, as well as operations for trust and security management are proposed in the context of third party's database access. Web services deployment issues concern the access control aimed to prevent from overloading. A formal method for a model-based load evaluation of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) application server is suggested. The method takes into account the distributed server architecture and the processing of heterogeneous traffic. The SOA application server's utilization is evaluated by simulation.",

abstract = "•COLLECT is COLLaborativE ConText-aware service oriented architecture.•COLLECT provides the means for intelligent decision-making for Collaborative IoT.•Air4HealthAdmin illustrates COLLECT applicability in IoT for the Health domain.•COLLECT addresses the H2020 challenge on context-aware Internet of Things. Internet of Things (IoT) has radically transformed the world; currently, every device can be connected to the Internet and provide valuable information for decision-making. In spite of the fast evolution of technologies accompanying the grow of IoT, we are still faced with the challenge of providing a service oriented architecture, which facilitates the inclusion of data coming together from several IoT devices, data delivery among a system's agents, real-time data processing and service provision to users. Furthermore, context-aware data processing and architectures still pose a challenge, in spite of being key requirements in order to get stronger IoT architectures. To face this challenge, we propose a COLLaborative ConText Aware Service Oriented Architecture (COLLECT), which facilitates both the integration of IoT heterogeneous domain context data — through the use of a light message broker — and easy data delivery among several agents and collaborative participants in the system — making use of an enterprise service bus —. In addition, this architecture provides real-time data processing thanks to the use of a complex event processing engine as well as services and intelligent decision-making procedures to users according to the needs of the domain in question. As a result, COLLECT has a great impact on context-aware decentralized and collaborative reasoning for IoT, promoting context-aware intelligent decision making in such scope. Since context-awareness is key for a wide range of recommender and intelligent systems, the presented novel solution improves decision making in a large number of fields where such systems require to promptly process a variety of ubiquitous collaborative and context-aware data.",

Firstly, we show that the differentiated channel access of IEEE 802.11e cannot effectively assure medical-grade QoS because of priority inversion. To resolve this problem, we propose an efficient channel access algorithm. The proposed algorithm adjusts arbitrary inter-frame space (AIFS) in the IEEE 802.11e protocol depending on the QoS measurement of medical traffic, to provide differentiated near-absolute priority for medical traffic. In addition, based on rigorous capacity analysis, we propose an admission control scheme that can avoid performance degradation due to network overload. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed mechanism strictly assures the medical-grade QoS and improves the throughput of low-priority traffic by more than several times compared to the conventional IEEE 802.11e.",

abstract = "Traffic state estimation from the floating car system is a challenging problem. The low penetration rate and random distribution make available floating car samples usually cover part space and time points of the road networks. To obtain a wide range of traffic state from the floating car system, many methods have been proposed to estimate the traffic state for the uncovered links. However, these methods cannot provide traffic state of the entire road networks. In this paper, the traffic state estimation is transformed to solve a missing data imputation problem, and the tensor completion framework is proposed to estimate missing traffic state. A tensor is constructed to model traffic state in which observed entries are directly derived from floating car system and unobserved traffic states are modeled as missing entries of constructed tensor. The constructed traffic state tensor can represent spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data and encode the multi-way properties of traffic state. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it can fully mine and utilize the multi-dimensional inherent correlations of traffic state. We tested the proposed approach on a well calibrated simulation network. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach yield reliable traffic state estimation from very sparse floating car data, particularly when dealing with the floating car penetration rate is below 1%.",

All partitions in an IMA system should be integrated together according to a proper schedule such that their deadlines will be met even under the worst case situations. In order to help provide a proper scheduling table for all partitions in IMA systems, we study the schedulability of independent partitions on a multiprocessor platform in this paper. We firstly present an exact formulation to calculate the maximum scaling factor and determine whether all partitions are schedulable on a limited number of processors. Then with a Game Theory analogy, we design an approximation algorithm to solve the scheduling problem of partitions, by allowing each partition to optimize its own schedule according to the allocations of the others.

In this work, a within-subjects experiment is conducted using a flicker paradigm, with which the hit rate and response time for change detection are obtained. The results show that depth of field has effects on change detection: the hit rate is smaller and response time is longer in the scene with small depth of field than in the scene with large depth of field or uniform blur. It is concluded that when depth of field is small and binocular disparity is not zero in a picture, the influence of depth of field on change detection is more significant than binocular disparity. This conclusion leads to the result that the change in the sharp area is detected easier and faster than in the area that is closer to the observer.",

abstract = "Encouraging cooperation among selfish individuals is crucial in many real-world systems, where individuals’ collective behaviors can be analyzed using evolutionary public goods game. Along this line, extensive studies have shown that reputation is an effective mechanism to investigate the evolution of cooperation. In most existing studies, participating individuals in a public goods game are assumed to contribute unconditionally into the public pool, or they can choose partners based on a common reputation standard (e.g., preferences or characters). However, to assign one reputation standard for all individuals is impractical in many real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce a reputation tolerance mechanism that allows an individual to select its potential partners and decide whether or not to contribute an investment to the public pool based on its tolerance to other individuals’ reputation. Specifically, an individual takes part in a public goods game only if the number of participants with higher reputation exceeds the value of its tolerance. Moreover, in this paper, an individual’s reputation can increase or decrease in a bounded interval based on its historical behaviors. We explore the principle that how the reputation tolerance and conditional investment mechanisms can affect the evolution of cooperation in spatial lattice networks. Our simulation results demonstrate that a larger tolerance value can achieve an environment that promote the cooperation of participants.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) has inspired solutions that are already available for addressing problems in various application scenarios, such as healthcare, security, emergency support and tourism. However, there is no clear approach to modeling these systems and envisioning their capabilities at the design time. Therefore, the process of designing these systems is ad hoc and its real impact is evaluated once the solution is already implemented, which is risky and expensive. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uses human-centric wireless sensor networks to specify and evaluate models of IoT-based systems at the time of design, avoiding the need to spend time and effort on early implementations of immature designs. It allows designers to focus on the system design, leaving the implementation decisions for a next phase. The article illustrates the usefulness of this proposal through a running example, showing the design of an IoT-based solution to support the first responses during medium-sized or large urban incidents. The case study used in the proposal evaluation is based on a real train crash. The proposed modeling approach can be used to design IoT-based systems for other application scenarios, e.g., to support security operatives or monitor chronic patients in their homes.",

abstract = "Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.",

However, capturing human movement adequately requires addressing difficult-to-satisfy requirements, which means that the applications that are possible with this technology are held back by a series of accessibility barriers, some technological and some regarding usability. To overcome these barriers and generate products with greater wearability that are more efficient and accessible, factors are compiled through a review of publications and market research. The result of this analysis is a design methodology called Octopus, which ranks these factors and schematises them. Octopus provides a tool that can help define design requirements for multidisciplinary teams, generating a common framework and offering a new method of communication between them.",

The IoT' network is a network of smart physical objects: devices, vehicles, buildings, etc. The IoT has a number of applications ranging from smart home, smart surveillance to smart healthcare systems. Since IoT consists of various heterogeneous devices that exhibit different traffic patterns and expect different quality of service (QoS) in terms of data rate, bit error rate and the stability index of the channel, therefore, in this paper, we formulated an optimization problem to assign channels to heterogeneous IoT devices within a smart building for the provisioning of their desired QoS. To solve this problem, a novel particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is proposed. Then, exhaustive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the supremacy of our proposed algorithm over the existing ones in terms of throughput, bit error rate and the stability index of the channel.",

abstract = "Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.",

A clearly outlined three-layer architecture, in the sense of Internet of Things, is presented. It provides the basis for integrating a broad range of sensors into smart healthcare infrastructure. More specifically, by making use of short-range communication sensors (sensing layer), gateways which implement data transmission and low-level computation (fog layer) and cloud computing for processing the data (application layer).

abstract = "With the soaring interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), some healthcare providers are facilitating remote care delivery through the use of wearable devices. These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

Due to their life- or mission-critical nature, these systems need to provide a high level of availability and accuracy. On the one hand, centralized cloud-based IoT systems lack reliability, punctuality and availability (e.g., in case of slow or unreliable Internet connection), and on the other hand, fully outsourcing data analytics to the edge of the network can result in diminished level of accuracy and adaptability due to the limited computational capacity in edge nodes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a hierarchical computing architecture, HiCH, for IoT-based health monitoring systems. The core components of the proposed system are 1) a novel computing architecture suitable for hierarchical partitioning and execution of machine learning based data analytics, 2) a closed-loop management technique capable of autonomous system adjustments with respect to patient's condition. HiCH benefits from the features offered by both fog and cloud computing and introduces a tailored management methodology for healthcare IoT systems.

abstract = "Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers, depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient’s health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.",

abstract = "Advances in computation, sensing, and networking have led to interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS). Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games.",

Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

abstract = "Experimentation infrastructures for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely adopted over the past decade for high‐fidelity validation and rapid prototyping of applications and for discovering and modeling phenomena that have led to improvements in analysis and simulation capabilities. Nonetheless, the community is still looking for more heterogeneous WSN testbeds for purposes such as federation, experiment regression analysis, and improved testbed availability. In addition, most existing WSN testbeds lack robustness and predictability in the presence of failures, and they do not provide user‐friendly support for scientific experimentation (e.g., quick repetition of experiments). We develop the testbed as a high‐fidelity, robust WSN experimentation infrastructure that provides the ease of scientific experimentation. Consisting of 130 TelosB motes with IEEE 802.15.4 radios and 15 Linux laptops with IEEE 802.11a/b/g radios, NetEye provides a WSN deployment that enables high‐fidelity experimentation with single‐hop as well as multihop WSN networking, and the lab‐scale deployment mimics network properties of building‐scale and outdoor WSN deployments. Building upon the authors’ experience in developing and using WSN testbeds in the past years, NetEye also has enhanced features that enables easy, robust scientific experimentation. In particular, NetEye provides users with a simple, powerful web portal, which streamlines users’ experience in the whole lifecycle of scientific experimentation (e.g., experiment scheduling, status monitoring, and data exfiltration). NetEye employs a stable, fault‐tolerant state machine to improve the robustness of the testbed in the presence of failures. NetEye also develops a health monitoring service that monitors hardware and software status; the real‐time health monitoring information about the testbed is seamlessly integrated with the lifecycle of experiment scheduling, experiment status monitoring, and experiment data analysis for both robust experimentation and for informed experiment analysis. To address the log‐data congestion problem in long‐running, large scale experiments, NetEye employs a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) mechanism to ensure reliability in exfiltrating experiment data to users. To facilitate quick, repetitive scientific experimentation, NetEye also speeds up the mote programming cycle through fast job status transition and multi‐thread‐based mote programming. NetEye has been successfully running for over 3.5 years, and it has been integrated with the federated WSN experimental infrastructure . NetEye is widely used by researchers from USA and Asia, and more than 10 experiments are executed through NetEye per day on average. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. We present NetEye, a robust and user‐friendly wireless sensor network testbed. NetEye is designed to enable efficient application deployment and support complex embedded sensing experiments. It provides a simple but powerful web portal, which streamlines user access and experiment schedules to one testbed job so that user has a clear view of whole system. NetEye implements the robust state machine and enhanced health monitoring service for job status monitoring and hardware failure detection.",

For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.",

Healthcare today makes massive use of expensive technology, not just in computer systems and hospital equipment but also devices attached to and even embedded in the human body, such as fitness monitors or digital pacemakers. In particular, the spread of the Internet of Things, the connection of increasing numbers of devices and objects to the internet, is increasing the number of potential access points for hackers. Unlike many of the more trivial uses for the Internet of Things, connected medical devices have obvious benefits because they can instantly exchange useful data or instructions with medical staff.

abstract = "For the rapid and accurate identification of cow reproduction and healthy behavior from mass surveillance video, in this study, 400 head of young cows and lactating cows were taken as the research object and analyzed cow behavior from the dairy activity area and milk hall ramp. The method of object recognition based on image entropy was proposed, aiming at the identification of motional cow object behavior against a complex background. Calculating a minimum bounding box and contour mapping were used for the real-time capture of rutting span behavior and hoof or back characteristics. Then, by combining the continuous image characteristics and movement of cows for 7 d, the method could quickly distinguish abnormal behavior of dairy cows from healthy reproduction, improving the accuracy of the identification of characteristics of dairy cows. Cow behavior recognition based on image analysis and activities was proposed to capture abnormal behavior that has harmful effects on healthy reproduction and to improve the accuracy of cow behavior identification. The experimental results showed that, through target detection, classification and recognition, the recognition rates of hoof disease and heat in the reproduction and health of dairy cows were greater than 80%, and the false negative rates of oestrus and hoof disease were 3.28% and 5.32%, respectively. This method can enhance the real-time monitoring of cows, save time and improve the management efficiency of large-scale farming.",

In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT.",

The IoT defines a world-wide cyber-physical system with a plethora of applications in the fields of domotics, e-health, goods monitoring and logistics, among others. The use of cross-layer communication schemes to provide adaptive solutions for the IoT is motivated by the high heterogeneity in the hardware capabilities and the communication requirements among things. In this paper, a novel cross-layer module for the IoT is proposed to accurately capture both the high heterogeneity of the IoT and the impact of the Internet as part of the network architecture. The fundamental part of the module is a mathematical framework, which is developed to obtain the optimal routing paths and the communication parameters among things, by exploiting the interrelations among different layer functionalities in the IoT. Moreover, a cross-layer communication protocol is presented to implement this optimization framework in practical scenarios. The results show that the proposed solution can achieve a global communication optimum and outperforms existing layered solutions. The novel cross-layer module is a primary step towards providing efficient and reliable end-to-end communication in the IoT.",

Design/methodology/approach – This column will explore how this technology might impact everyday life, and examine this technology’s implications for libraries. Findings – Companies of all kinds, including Intel, Microsoft, AT & T and DHL are all investing in the IOT, citing a variety of reports that estimate tremendous future growth. For example, a recent report by Business Insider predicts that by 2019, the IOT will be the largest device market in the world (overshadowing desktop computers and mobile devices combined) and create $1.7 trillion in new value, affecting business, homes, transportation, health care and government operations . Originality/value – Almost regardless of the success or failure of any given product, the concept of the IOT is a model that is affecting investors and businesses of all types, and in turn affecting technologies that are being developed today. By better understanding the IOT, librarians can therefore be better positioned to respond to developments as they emerge. </p>",

To deal with these overheads, novel metrics, and methods are introduced in an attempt to maximize the capabilities and widen acceptance/usage provided by the Internet of Things. Without losing its generality, the method discussed is experimentally evaluated in the paradigm of the Health domain.

In this context, in January 2016, the European Commission has funded seven projects that are to deal with various aspects of interoperability in the Internet of Things. Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search.

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.",

Bootstrapping is a procedure by which a user obtains key material and configuration information, among other parameters, to operate as an authenticated party in a security domain. Until now solutions have focused on re-using security protocols that were not developed for IoT constraints. For this reason, in this work we propose a design and implementation of a lightweight bootstrapping service for IoT networks that leverages one of the application protocols used in IoT : Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Additionally, in order to provide flexibility, scalability, support for large scale deployment, accountability and identity federation, our design uses technologies such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA). We have named this service CoAP-EAP. First, we review the state of the art in the field of bootstrapping and specifically for IoT. Second, we detail the bootstrapping service: the architecture with entities and interfaces and the flow operation. Third, we obtain performance measurements of CoAP-EAP (bootstrapping time, memory footprint, message processing time, message length and energy consumption) and compare them with PANATIKI. The most significant and constrained representative of the bootstrapping solutions related with CoAP-EAP. As we will show, our solution provides significant improvements, mainly due to an important reduction of the message length.</p>",

However, these methods remain of limited value if we cannot further reason with the identified food and drink items, ingredients and quantities/portion sizes in a proposed meal in various contexts; i.e., understand from a semantic perspective their types, properties, and interrelationships in the context of a given user’s health condition and preferences.

To address this problem, we propose a framework for modeling and assessing the security of the IoT and provide a formal definition of the framework. Generally, the framework consists of five phases: (1) data processing, (2) security model generation, (3) security visualization, (4) security analysis, and (5) model updates. Using the framework, we can find potential attack scenarios in the IoT, analyze the security of the IoT through well-defined security metrics, and assess the effectiveness of different defense strategies. The framework is evaluated via three scenarios, which are the smart home, wearable healthcare monitoring and environment monitoring scenarios. We use the analysis results to show the capabilities of the proposed framework for finding potential attack paths and mitigating the impact of attacks.",

Based on a survey test of 337 smart home users, this study applies partial least squares technique analysis to test the research model. Findings The research results show that perceived psychological factors (perceived ease of use, perceived intelligence, perceived convenience and perceived privacy risk) have significant effect on the intention and behavior of IOT systems usage through perceived usefulness. Cognitive experience moderates the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, perceived privacy risk and perceived usefulness; affect experience moderates the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Research limitations/implications The current study mainly tested the antecedents of consumers' usage of IOT systems, and the outcome of using the system was not investigated. Future research can examine the outcome (e.g. satisfaction, perceived value) by using the expectation-confirmation theory. Originality/value This study provides a useful insight into the key driving factors in consumers' intention and behavior of using IOT systems. The previous studies over IOT systems have not observed consumers' perception of IOT systems, but in fact IOT systems are being applied to more and more personal users.",

Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem. This evaluates for the proposed protocol the data aggregation mechanism level, Round-Trip delay Time, impact of the distance, and the impact of the security. It has been concluded that secure continuous monitoring is feasible with the use of the proposed {YOAPY}} aggregation mechanisms and the capabilities from the proposed interconnection framework.",

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.",

In this paper we develop effective, scalable, and realistic data collection and upload solutions using mobile data collectors in community IoT systems. Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30%–60% improvement in overall data utility, 30% reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability.",

The health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT) increasingly plays a key role in health management by providing real-time tele-monitoring of patients, testing of treatments, actuation of medical devices, and fitness and well-being monitoring. Given its numerous applications and proposed benefits, adoption by medical and social care institutions and consumers may be rapid. However, a host of ethical concerns are also raised that must be addressed. The inherent sensitivity of health-related data being generated and latent risks of Internet-enabled devices pose serious challenges. Users, already in a vulnerable position as patients, face a seemingly impossible task to retain control over their data due to the scale, scope and complexity of systems that create, aggregate, and analyse personal health data. In response, the H-IoT must be designed to be technologically robust and scientifically reliable, while also remaining ethically responsible, trustworthy, and respectful of user rights and interests. To assist developers of the H-IoT, this paper describes nine principles and nine guidelines for ethical design of H-IoT devices and data protocols.",

In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system.

Right now, operations related to dosage are based on insulin infusion protocol boards, which are provided by physicians to the patients. These boards are not considering very influential factors such as glycemic index from the diet, consequently patients need to estimate the dosage leading to dose error, which culminates in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia episode. Therefore, right insulin infusion calculation needs to be supported by the next generation of personal-care devices. For this reason, a personal device has been developed to assist and consider more factors in the insulin therapy dosage calculation. The proposed solution is based on Internet of things in order to, on the one hand, support a patient’s profile management architecture based on personal RFID cards and, on the other hand, provide global connectivity between the developed patient’s personal device based on 6LoWPAN, nurses/physicians desktop application to manage personal health cards, glycemic index information system, and patient’s web portal. This solution has been evaluated by a multidisciplinary group formed by patients, physicians, and nurses.",

abstract = "Due to the drastic growth and an upsurge in the wireless communication devices in the world in recent years, there is a high demand of uninterrupted and intelligent connectivity in a self-organising manner amongst the users. It becomes more challenging for the emerging users because of scarcity of bandwidth. To overcome the unforbidden challenges in the advanced technologies like smart cities, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio provides the solution to achieve high throughput and continuous connectivity for reliable communication. A primary challenge in the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is the identification of dependable Data Channels (DCHs) for Secondary Users (SUs) communication amongst the available channels, and the continuation of communication when the Primary Users (PUs) return. The objective of every SU is to intelligently choose reliable DCHs, thereby ensuring reliable connectivity and successful transfer of data frames across the cognitive networks. The proposed Reliable, Intelligent and Smart Cognitive Radio protocol consumes less computational time and transmits energy with high throughput, as compared to the benchmark Cognitive Radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocols. This paper provides new applications of CR technology for IoT and proposes new and effective solutions to the real challenges in CR technology that will make IoT more affordable and applicable. Highlights•We introduce Novel Channel Selection Criteria for IoTCR Protocols•We introduce Backup Channel Techniques for the SUs when PUs turn ON on their respective channels.•We propose a model for integration of IoT with CR technology.•The proposed approach has achieved higher throughput and data rate as compared to other benchmark protocols.•The proposed model can be utilised for other technologies such as Smart city, e-health, communication, 5G, it, IoE, etc., and make these technologies highly effective for the users around the world.",

Specifically, it proposes to join forces toward interoperability and standardization of Internet and audiology. Method: A summary of why such a collaborative effort is required is provided from historical and scientific perspectives. A roadmap toward interoperability and standardization is proposed. Results: Information and communication technologies improve the flow of health care data and pave the way to better health care. However, hearing-related products, features, and services are notoriously heterogeneous and incompatible with other health care systems (no interoperability). Standardization is the process of developing and implementing technical standards (e.g., Noah hearing database). All parties involved in interoperability and standardization realize mutual gains by making mutually consistent decisions. De jure (officially endorsed) standards can be developed in collaboration with large national health care systems as well as spokespeople for hearing care professionals and hearing device users. The roadmap covers mutual collaboration; data privacy, security, and ownership; compliance with current regulations; scalability and modularity; and the scope of interoperability and standards. Conclusions: We propose to join forces to pave the way to the interoperable Internet and audiology products, features, and services that the world needs.",

abstract = "The concurrent usage of actigraphy and heart rate variability (HRV) for sleep efficiency quantification is still matter of investigation. This study compared chest (CACT) and wrist (WACT) actigraphy (actigraphs positioned on chest and wrist, respectively) in combination with HRV for automatic sleep vs wake classification. Accelerometer and ECG signals were collected during polysomnographic studies (PSGs) including 18 individuals (25-53 years old) with no previous history of sleep disorders. Then, an experienced neurologist performed sleep staging on PSG data. Eleven features from HRV and accelerometry were extracted from series of different lengths. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to automatically distinguish sleep and wake. We found 7 min as the optimal signal length for classification, while maximizing specificity (wake detection). CACT and WACT provided similar accuracies (78% chest vs 77% wrist), larger than what yielded by HRV alone (66%). The addition of HRV to CACT reduced slightly the accuracy, while improving specificity (from 33% to 51%,p< 0.05). On the contrary, the concurrent usage of HRV and WACT did not provide statistically significant improvements over WACT. Then, a subset of features (3 from HRV + 1 from actigraphy) was selected by reducing redundancy using a strategy based on Spearman's correlation and area under the ROC curve. The usage of the reduced set of features and SVM classifier gave only slightly reduced classification performances, which did not differ from the full sets of features. The study opens interesting possibilities in the design of wearable devices for long-term monitoring of sleep at home.",

To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented to experimentally analyze and compare the resource efficiency of different SAT verification approaches in terms of a number of performance metrics, including computation and communication overhead.",

Our results reveal that self-polarization due to grain orientation along the spontaneous polarization direction plays an important role in achieving large piezoelectric response in a domain motion-confined material. The phase field simulations confirm that the large piezoelectric voltage coefficient g 33 originates from maximized piezoelectric strain coefficient d33 and minimized dielectric permittivity [varepsilon]33 in [001]-textured PbTiO3 ceramics where domain wall motions are absent.",

However, after a scrutinization of these two schemes, we found them not secure enough as claimed, and then demonstrated that these schemes suffer from various attacks, such as offline dictionary attack, impersonation attack, no user anonymity, no forward secrecy, etc. Furthermore, we proposed an enhanced scheme to overcome the identified weaknesses, and proved its security via Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the heuristic analysis.

The developed piezo coatings show good sensitivity to the longitudinal and flexural modes of guided waves. Sensing voltage due to the guided waves at various different ultrasonic frequencies shows a linear dependence on the thickness of the coating. The coatings also exhibit linear sensor output voltage with respect to the induced dynamic strain magnitude. Diameter/size of the piezo coatings strongly influences the voltage response in relation to the wavelength. The proposed method used a characterization set-up involving coated sensors, reference transducers and an analytical model to estimate the piezoelectric coefficient of the piezo coating. The method eliminates the size dependent effect on the piezo property accurately and gives further insight to design better sensors/filters with respect to frequency/wavelength of interest. The developed coatings will have interesting applications in structural health monitoring (SHM) and internet of things (IOT).",

abstract = "<p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected things that are uniquely addressable, via standard communication protocols. The use of IoT for continuous monitoring of public health is being rapidly adopted by various countries while generating a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse high-velocity data. Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.</p></p>",

As the buildings consume two third of electricity globally, the real-time monitoring, by using the internet, is one of the key factors to manage the energy consumption and to optimize the buildings' performance. Accordingly, the buildings' systems have utilized the information technology's revolution in the last decade in several manners. One of the very interesting synergies is that developing relationship between the energy monitoring and the Internet of Things (IoT) for most of buildings' sensors, energy meters and building automation systems. These new technologies interact effectively with the Smart Home Energy Management System. It increases its value and ensures securing tangible benefits. As shown through the findings of this study, the level of buildings intelligence will significantly contribute the improvement of energy performance. Not only, the energy demand and the use of energy will be smartly efficient. As a result, the renewable energy systems in such smart homes will be a cost-effective option and the probability to build a net zero energy home becomes materialized and affordable economically.This paper reviews the latest technologies and telecommunication techniques that used in the homes to monitor energy performance. It also discusses a case study in Riyadh - Saudi Arabia about smart home's technologies, and the impact of using the renewable energy to improve the energy performance compared to the energy benchmark.

To make the planet more sustainable, abundant data has to be collected and analyzed from ecosystems for scientific decision-making, restoring and preserving natural resources. In this paper, an integrated systems approach has been proposed for the data acquisition and analysis in information management of an ecosystem; it is a direct extension of an agriculture ecosystem enterprise information system (AEEIS) developed by Xu et al.

The challenges in system development have been discussed, and the significance of the developed system has been illustrated through a thorough discussion and a case study on the genetic coding and expression of antelopes. In the case study, an IoT-based enterprise information system (EIS) has been applied to investigate the effects of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on the adaptation mechanism to high altitude hypoxia. Two remarkable conclusions are (i) the levels of the STAT3 mRNA and protein vary from one tissue to another, and the highest level is in the lung tissue, and (ii) Tibetan antelope's expression of STAT3 mRNA and protein are higher than that from plain sheep. Based on the fact that a Tibetan antelope has a higher adaptability to hypoxia; it has illustrated that the hypoxic STAT3-specific expression is one of the molecular bases of high altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan antelope.",

The scenario under analysis is an emergency room area, where a patient is being monitored remotely with the aid of wearable wireless sensors placed at different body locations. Due to the advent of Internet of Things, in the near future a cloud of a vast number of wireless devices will be operating at the same time, potentially interfering one another. Ensuring good performance of the deployed wireless networks in this kind of environment is mandatory and obtaining accurate radio propagation estimations by means of a computationally efficient algorithm is a key issue. For that purpose, an in-house three-dimensional ray launching algorithm is employed, which provides radio frequency power distribution values, power delay profiles, and delay spread values for the complete volume of complex indoor scenarios. Using this information together with signal-to-noise estimations and link budget calculations, the most suitable wireless body area network technology for this context is chosen. Additionally, an in-house developed human body model has been developed in order to model the impact of the presence of monitored patients. A campaign of measurements has been carried out in order to validate the obtained simulation results. Both the measurements and simulation results illustrate the strong influence of the presented scenario on the overall performance of the wireless body area networks: losses due to material absorption and the strong influence of multipath components due to the great number of obstacles and the presence of persons make the use of the presented method very useful. Finally, an android-based application for the monitoring of patients is presented and tested within the emergency room scenario, providing a flexible solution to increase interactivity in health service provision.",

In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.",

abstract = "The development of internet of things and the related sensor technology have been a key driving force for the rapid development of industry and information technology. The requirement of wireless, sustainable and independent operation is becoming increasingly important for sensor networks that currently could include thousands even to millions of sensor nodes with different functionalities. For these purposes, developing technologies of self-powered sensors that can utilize the ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves is highly desirable and mandatory. The realization of self-powered sensors generally has two approaches: the first approach is to develop environmental energy harvesting devices for driving the traditional sensors; the other is to develop a new category of sensors – self-powered active sensors – that can actively generate electrical signal itself as a response to a stimulation/triggering from the ambient environment. The recent invention and intensive development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new technology for mechanical energy harvesting can be utilized as self-powered active mechanical sensors, because the parameters (magnitude, frequency, number of periods, etc.) of the generated electrical signal are directly determined by input mechanical behaviors. In this review paper, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including the four basic working modes. Then, the most updated progress of developing TENGs as self-powered active sensors is reviewed. TENGs with different working modes and rationally designed structures have been developed as self-powered active sensors for a variety of mechanical motions, including pressure change, physical touching, vibrations, acoustic waves, linear displacement, rotation, tracking of moving objects, and acceleration detection. Through combining the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the detection of both static and dynamic processes has been enabled. The integration of individual sensor elements into arrays or matrixes helps to realize the mapping or parallel detection for multiple points. On the other hand, the relationship between the amplitude of TENG-generated electrical signal and the chemical state of its triboelectric surface enables TENGs to function as self-powered active chemical sensors. Through continuous research on the TENG-based self-powered active sensors in the coming years to further improve the sensitivity and realize the self-powered operation for the entire sensor node systems, they will soon have broad applications in touch screens, electronic skins, healthcare, environmental/infrastructure monitoring, national security, and more. •The fundamental of triboelectric nanogenerators as the basis of serving as self-powered active sensors.•Triboelectric-nanogenerator-based self-powered active sensors for different types of mechanical motions, chemical detection and environmental monitoring.•An insightful perspective for the future research.",

However, the existing algorithms often utilize only one distance function to evaluate the distance between data items on each feature, which cannot deal with datasets with complex inner structures. In this paper, a composite kernel space (CKS) is constructed based on a set of basis kernels and a novel framework of soft subspace clustering is proposed by integrating distance metric learning in the CKS. Two soft subspace clustering algorithms, i.e., entropy weighting fuzzy clustering in CKS for kernel space (CKS-EWFC-K) and feature space (CKS-EWFC-F) are thus developed. In both algorithms, the prototype in the feature space is mapped into the CKS by multiple simultaneous mappings, one mapping for each cluster, which is distinct from existing kernel-based clustering algorithms. By evaluating the distance on each feature in the CKS, both CKS-EWFC-K and CKS-EWFC-F learn the distance function adaptively during the clustering process. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms in general outperform classical clustering algorithms and are immune to ineffective kernels and irrelevant features in soft subspace.

RPL constructs tree-like routing topology rooted at an LLN border router (LBR) and supports bidirectional IPv6 communication to and from the mesh devices by providing both upward and downward routing over the routing tree. In this article, we focus on the interoperability of downward routing and supporting its two modes of operations (MOPs) defined in the RPL standard (RFC 6550). Specifically, we show that there exists a serious connectivity problem in RPL protocol when two MOPs are mixed within a single network, even for standard-compliant implementations, which may result in network partitions. To address this problem, this article proposes <i>DualMOP-RPL</i>, an enhanced version of RPL, which supports nodes with different MOPs for downward routing to communicate gracefully in a single RPL network while preserving the high bidirectional data delivery performance. <i>DualMOP-RPL</i> allows multiple overlapping RPL networks in the same geographical regions to cooperate as a single densely connected network even if those networks are using different MOPs. This will not only improve the link qualities and routing performances of the networks but also allow for network migrations and alternate routing in the case of LBR failures. We evaluate <i>DualMOP-RPL</i> through extensive simulations and testbed experiments and show that our proposal eliminates all the problems we have identified.</p></p>",

abstract = "The Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) is a wireless network that is designed to allow communication among sensor nodes that are attached to a human body to monitor the body’s vital parameters and environment. The design and development of such WBSN systems for health monitoring have received a large amount of attention recently, in research studies and in industry. This attention is mainly motivated by costly health care and by recent advances in the development of miniature health monitoring devices as well as emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which contribute to the main challenges of 5G. The existence of an explicit approach to address the required software design and verification should be very beneficial for the construction and maintenance of such systems. This paper presents a preventive health care system that has a flexible design. The proposed system is based on an architecture that has heterogeneous nodes and provides both daily continuous monitoring as well as specific controls. We defined a model to describe the WBSN’s global behavior. An important aspect of this work is that we propose a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to address the derivation of each node’s behavior in the WBSN from the WBSN global behavior. This approach allows developers to obtain a system design from the global specification of its requirement. To ensure the conformance of this design to its specification, the derived behaviors should be validated and verified before their deployment. In fact, formal methods are powerful tools for software engineers to verify the logical correctness of concurrent software at different levels of its life cycle. Model checking is one of the most powerful formal methods for verifying the logical correctness of such concurrent systems. In this work, we make use of a model checking approach that is based on a model transformation to validate the automatically derived behavior of a WBSN for health monitoring. This model-driven approach will check whether the derived system behaves correctly according to its global specification, while the objective is to increase the system’s performance and QoS. This approach allows the developer to reason about a model of the global system rather than about the system itself.",

Food safety incidents and scandals, frequently breaking out around the world, are significantly reducing the confidence of consumers in food safety and quality. It is even more difficult to achieve the full transparency, visibility and traceability of dynamic cross-border and global food supply chains, which is critical to ensure food safety and quality, due to: the personalization and globalization of consumer demands; the diversities of food products, raw materials and ingredients; the loose relationships between food business partners; the technology and resource barriers in aligning business processes, coordinating and sharing information; and the changing government supervision mechanisms and standards. Social networking technologies and social software are promising enablers to facilitate end consumers, food companies and government agencies to participate in open discussion, comments and feedback on the quality and safety of cross-border foods. They are able to connect, interact, communicate and collaborate with each other in loose, open, effective and flexible ways for enhancing the transparency and visibility of cross-border and global food supply chains through collective wisdom and intelligence. In this paper a framework is proposed for developing social networks enabling food traceability systems, which not only leverages enterprise applications, public service platforms for food quality, safety and traceability operated by government or industrial associations, but utilizes such emerging technologies as Internet-of-Things, social analytic and mobile technologies to ease interactive communication and collaboration between various stakeholders of food chains. Guidelines, architectures, use scenarios, and technology alternatives for implementing the traceability systems are also discussed in this work.

abstract = "One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients’ place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.",

In these applications, various devices can be identified using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags, which can be used for transferring the collected data to other local or remote objects at various geographical locations. However, for automatic reading of data accumulated in an RFID-tag embedded in an object/device, authentication is required at various stages for the aforementioned applications. In RFID-based systems for smart applications, an RFID-tag may be operated from several meters distance and it does not require to be put within direct line-of-sight of the reader like a barcode system. Therefore, the traditional barcode system will be replaced by the RFID authentication system in near future since in the later, technology reading of a large amount of data within short span is possible. However, in existing RFID-based authentication systems, an adversary may access the RFID-tag information, which can compromise the privacy and it may also create forgery problems. In addition, RFID-based authentication is suffering from heavy computation burden since an RFID-tag has very limited computation capability. To address these issues, lots of anonymous RFID-based authentication schemes have been designed using lightweight cryptographic tools, e.g., the hash function and symmetric key encryption. However, all these schemes failed to achieve known security and functionality requirements. Motivated by the above-mentioned issues, in this paper, we have put forwarded an RFID-based authentication architecture for distributed IoT (Internet of Things) applications suitable for the future smart city environments. Subsequently, we have put forwarded a lightweight RFID-based authentication scheme to provide reasonable execution time compared to existing schemes. Our scheme provides forward secrecy, anonymity and untraceability of RFID-tag, and secure localization. In summary, the proposed scheme can be used in wide range of applications in smart city environments. •New RFID-based authentication scheme is designed for IoT-based infrastructure in smart city environment.•The proposed scheme has been verified with respect to various parameters where its performance was found superior than the other existing schemes of its category.•The designed scheme can be used for future smart city environment for preserving security at various levels.",

The proposed direct estimation framework has three advantages. Firstly, different from most of the existing state-of-the-art methods in which estimating each component's density in this linear combination of densities and then combining them linearly are required, it can directly estimate the linear combination of densities as a whole, and it has at least comparable to or even better approximation accuracy than the existing density estimation methods. Secondly, the time complexity of the proposed direct estimation framework is O(l .sup.3) in which l is the number of Gaussian components in this framework which are generally viewed as the Gaussian distributions of the clusters in a dataset, and hence l is generally much less than the size of the dataset, so it is very suitable for large datasets. Thirdly, this proposed framework can be typically used to develop alternative approaches to classification, data condensation, identification of the independence between random variables, conditional density estimation and the similarity identification between multiple source domains and a target domain. Our preliminary results about experiments on several typical applications indicate the power of the proposed direct estimation framework.

abstract = "Tactile sensors, most commonly referred as strain and pressure sensors, can collect mechanical property data of the human body and local environment, to provide valuable insights into the human health status or artificial intelligence systems. The introduction of a high level of wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects, providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary curved surface over their stiffcounterparts without incurring damage, emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force, temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization), further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory, signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major research frontiers in recent years. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art wearable tactile sensors concerning basic concepts, functional materials, sensing mechanism, promising applications, performance optimization strategies, multifunctional sensing, and system integration.

Smartphone, sensor devices, cellular communication, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recent technologies that provide new mobile location based services. Such services could help mobile tourists, i.e. tourist who is currently moving between various sites, to get innovative set of services which make their trip easier and safer. Designing efficient solutions that help tourists with chronic diseases to find an appropriate geographical route from a source to a tourism destination through a transportation network is crucial to healthcare systems. This paper proposes a new approach in generating geographical routes that are best served with close medical centers. Our approach, called Geographical Routing for Mobile Tourist (GRMT), selects a route that is best served with medical centers, and goes through the path that is as shortest as possible in regards with the distance. We have modeled and simulated the proposed approach using simulation program. Simulated experimental results show that GRMT allows tourists to select geographical routes that are served with the highest number of close medical centers although the selected route is slightly longer in distance. •An IoT architecture connecting a health-worrier tourist to nearby healthcare centers is introduced.•An approach to find a geographical route that is best served with healthcare centers is proposed.•An analytical model for weighing various available geographical routes is presented.•Routes weighing is based on closeness, speciality, and number of nearby healthcare centers.•The efficiency of the proposed approach in overcoming tourists travel constraints was evaluated via simulation.",

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient&#x0027;s clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups.

abstract = "Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness. •An energy management scheme for sustainability of cloud data centers in the edge cloud environment is presented.•Support vector machine is used for designing workload classification scheme in edge–cloud environment.•SDN based model is designed to deal with the issues of congestion at the network during data transmission.",

Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system – the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) – and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the ‘missing link’ in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements.

To overcome these challenges and to get more precisely the reconcilement between the evidence theory with the frequentist approach of probability calculus, this work proposes a new methodology for combining beliefs, addressing some of the disadvantages exhibited by the evidence theory and its derivatives.

Maharaj (1), Reza Malekian (1) Keywords: Cloud centric architecture; Cloud health care architectures; Cloud security; EHealth; Health care applications; Health care framework; IoT architecture; Sustainable health center Abstract: Diabetes, blood pressure, heart, and kidney, some of the diseases common across the world, are termed 'silent killers'. More than 50 % of the world's population are affected by these diseases. If suitable steps are not taken during the early stages then severe complications occur from these diseases. In the work proposed, we have discussed the manner in which the Internet-of-Things based Cloud centric architecture is used for predictive analysis of physical activities of the users in sustainable health centers. The architecture proposed is based on the embedded sensors of the equipment rather than using wearable sensors or Smartphone sensors to store the value of the basic health-related parameters. Cloud centric architecture is composed of a Cloud data center, Public cloud, Private cloud, and uses the XML Web services for secure and fast communication of information. The architecture proposed here is evaluated for its adoption, prediction analysis of physical activities, efficiency, and security. From the results obtained it can be seen that the overall response between the local database server and Cloud data center remains almost constant with the rise in the number of users. For prediction analysis, If the results collected in real time for the analysis of physical activities exceed any of the parameter limits of the defined threshold value then an alert is sent to the health care personnel. Security analysis also shows the effective encryption and decryption of information. The architecture presented is effective and reduces the proliferation of information. It is also suggested, that a person suffering from any of the diseases mentioned above can defer the onset of complications by doing regular physical activities.

abstract = "  Emergence of context-aware technologies and IoT devices reflect that the quality of a human life has become one of the most essential aspects in Smart Cities. With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.",

However, how to automatically collect and analyze the large-scale user-generated data that are relevant to tobacco in participatory media is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach of sensing collective activities in tobacco-related participatory media. Meanwhile, we compare the temporal patterns, topological patterns, and collective emotion patterns among protobacco, antitobacco, and quit-tobacco groups. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was implemented to collect large-scale tobacco-related data sets from Facebook. This demonstrates that the proposed framework is feasible and reasonable. Our preliminary findings reveal that, first, tobacco-related content grows exponentially. In particular, the growth of the protobacco group follows the exponential law, whereas there is linear growth for the tobacco control group. Second, the connection between the tobacco control community and the tobacco cessation community is tight, whereas the nodes in the protobacco community are connected sparsely. Finally, the collective emotion in tobacco communities is negative.",

It represents an urban model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will present in this paper.

Thus, concerns over privacy invasion have come to the fore, and at the same time security issues are considered to override information services. This paper proposes a communication protocol based on hash lock, session keys, random numbers and security keys designed to be safe against intruders’ hacking attempts in information communication between medical devices. Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program. In brief, the proposed communication protocol for medical devices is safe and secure against diverse attacks.",

Akyildiz (a)(b) Keywords: Internet of Things; Cyber-physical systems; Cross-layer design; Optimization Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel networking paradigm which allows the communication among all sorts of physical objects over the Internet. The IoT defines a world-wide cyber-physical system with a plethora of applications in the fields of domotics, e-health, goods monitoring and logistics, among others. The use of cross-layer communication schemes to provide adaptive solutions for the IoT is motivated by the high heterogeneity in the hardware capabilities and the communication requirements among things. In this paper, a novel cross-layer module for the IoT is proposed to accurately capture both the high heterogeneity of the IoT and the impact of the Internet as part of the network architecture. The fundamental part of the module is a mathematical framework, which is developed to obtain the optimal routing paths and the communication parameters among things, by exploiting the interrelations among different layer functionalities in the IoT. Moreover, a cross-layer communication protocol is presented to implement this optimization framework in practical scenarios. The results show that the proposed solution can achieve a global communication optimum and outperforms existing layered solutions. The novel cross-layer module is a primary step towards providing efficient and reliable end-to-end communication in the IoT.

The rehabilitation treatment involved GDSR exercises, hot pack, and interferential therapy. All patients first received hot pack and interferential therapy on the shoulder joints before engaging in the exercises. The GDSR exercise sessions were 40 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks. Main Measures. Clinical assessments included Constant and Murley score, range of motion of the shoulder, and muscle strength of upper arm as main measures. Motor indices from sensor data and task performance were measured as secondary measures. Results. The pre- and posttest results for task performance, motor indices, and the clinical assessments indicated significant improvement for the majority of the assessed items. Correlation analysis between the task performance and clinical assessments revealed significant correlations among a number of items. Stepwise regression analysis showed that task performance effectively predicted the results of several clinical assessment items. Conclusions. The motor ingredients derived from the wearable sensor and task performance are applicable and adequate to examine and predict clinical improvement after GDSR training.",

Using the model, we analyze the synergistic effect of the functional requirements (data collection from the human body and transferring it to the top level) and non-functional requirements (trade-offs between energy-security-environmental factors, treated as Quality-of-Service (QoS)). We use feature models to represent the requirements at the earliest stage for the analysis and describe a model-driven methodology to design the possible BAN applications. Firstly, we specify the requirements as the problem domain (PD) variability model for the BAN applications. Next, we introduce the generative technology (meta-programming as the solution domain (SD)) and the mapping procedure to map the PD feature-based variability model onto the SD feature model. Finally, we create an executable meta-specification that represents the BAN functionality to describe the variability of the problem domain though transformations. The meta-specification (along with the meta-language processor) is a software generator for multiple BAN-oriented applications. We validate the methodology with experiments and a case study to generate a family of programs for the BAN sensor controllers. This enables to obtain the adequate measure of QoS efficiently through the interactive adjustment of the meta-parameter values and re-generation process for the concrete BAN application.</p>",

abstract = "<p> Purpose Taking into account the current relevance of the concept of smart city connected with the Internet of Things, this work aims to study the implementation of this concept by applying a new energy model in an existing public building. The purpose of this paper is to enhance the sustainability and energy autonomy of the building. Design/methodology/approach The building referred to in the case study is a library, and simulations related to the ongoing study are based on an energy audit, comprising a survey on electrical and thermal energy consumption. The innovative proposed model consists of a mix of energy production processes based on photovoltaic panels and biomass boilers. Economic analysis of the energy model has already yielded some results regarding the payback on investment, as well as avoided emissions in the context of development of a low-carbon economy with avoided emissions and socioeconomic advantages. Findings It is possible to enhance the sustainability of the library studied by the retrofit of the current energy system. With the integration of photovoltaic panels and the conversion or replacement of boilers from natural gas to biomass, the GHG emissions could drop around 121 t CO2 per year. Another benefit would be the inclusion of endogenous resources over imported energy resources. The payback period for the measures proposed ranges from 2.5 to 8 years, proving that the increase in environmental sustainability is viable. Originality/value The intention here is to implement the concept of smart city, in more sustainable buildings, bringing them to the lowest possible energy consumption levels, hence increasing performance and comfort. Also, taking into account that the energy-consuming buildings are already constructed, it is urgent to reconvert them to lower the use of energy and emissions using technologies based on renewable energy, boosting the use of local resources. </p>",

abstract = "Monitoring the snow pack is crucial for many stakeholders, whether for hydro-power optimization, water management or flood control. Traditional forecasting relies on regression methods, which often results in snow melt runoff predictions of low accuracy in non-average years. Existing ground-based real-time measurement systems do not cover enough physiographic variability and are mostly installed at low elevations. We present the hardware and software design of a state-of-the-art distributed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based autonomous measurement system with real-time remote data transmission that gathers data of snow depth, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and solar radiation in physiographically representative locations. Elevation, aspect, slope and vegetation are used to select network locations, and distribute sensors throughout a given network location, since they govern snow pack variability at various scales. Three WSNs were installed in the Sierra Nevada of Northern California throughout the North Fork of the Feather River, upstream of the Oroville dam and multiple powerhouses along the river. The WSNs gathered hydrologic variables and network health statistics throughout the 2017 water year, one of northern Sierra's wettest years on record. These networks leverage an ultra-low-power wireless technology to interconnect their components and offer recovery features, resilience to data loss due to weather and wildlife disturbances and real-time topological visualizations of the network health. Data show considerable spatial variability of snow depth, even within a 1 km 2 network location. Combined with existing systems, these WSNs can better detect precipitation timing and phase in, monitor sub-daily dynamics of infiltration and surface runoff during precipitation or snow melt, and inform hydro power managers about actual ablation and end-of-season date across the landscape.",

Applying wireless sensor networks for the IoT-based telemedicine system enables doctors, caregivers or families to monitor patients' physiological conditions at anytime and anyplace according to the acquired information. However, transmitting physiological data through the Internet concerns the personal privacy of patients. Therefore, before users can access medical care services in IoT-based medical care system, they must be authenticated. Typically, user authentication and data encryption are most critical for securing network communications over a public channel between two or more participants. In 2016, Liu and Chung proposed a bilinear pairing-based password authentication scheme for wireless healthcare sensor networks. They claimed their authentication scheme cannot only secure sensor data transmission, but also resist various well-known security attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that Liu-Chung's scheme has some security weaknesses, and we further present an improved secure authentication and data encryption scheme for the IoT-based medical care system, which can provide user anonymity and prevent the security threats of replay and password/sensed data disclosure attacks. Moreover, we modify the authentication process to reduce redundancy in protocol design, and the proposed scheme is more efficient in performance compared with previous related schemes. Finally, the proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under ECDHP.",

abstract = "  Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.",

As a result, cities worldwide are undergoing a major process of urbanization with ever increasing wealth of sensing capabilities – hence the Internet of Things (IoT). These trends impose great pressure on how healthcare is done. This paper describes the design and implementation of a situated clinical decision support (SCDSS) system, most appropriate for smart cities. The SCDSS was prototyped and enhanced in a clinic. The SCDSS was then used in a clinic as well as in a university hospital centre. In this article, the system’s architecture, subcomponents and integrated workflow are described. The systems’ design was the result of a knowledge acquisition process involving interviews with five specialists and testing with 50 patients. The reports (specialist consultation report) generated by the SCDSS were shown to general practitioners who were not able to distinguish them from human specialist reports. We propose a context-aware CDSS and assess its effectiveness in managing a wide medical range of patients. Five different patient cases were identified for analysis. The SCDSS was used to produce draft electronic specialist consultations, which were then compared to the original specialists’ consultations. It was found that the SCDSS-generated consults were of better quality for a number of reasons discussed herein. SCDSSs have great promise for their use in the clinical environment of smart cities.

abstract = "Objectives A number of technologies can reduce overall costs for the prevention or management of chronic illnesses. These include devices that constantly monitor health indicators, devices that auto-administer therapies, or devices that track real-time health data when a patient self-administers a therapy. Because they have increased access to high-speed Internet and smartphones, many patients have started to use mobile applications (apps) to manage various health needs. These devices and mobile apps are now increasingly used and integrated with telemedicine and telehealth via the medical Internet of Things (mIoT). This paper reviews mIoT and big data in healthcare fields. Methods mIoT is a critical piece of the digital transformation of healthcare, as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences. Results Wearables and mobile apps today support fitness, health education, symptom tracking, and collaborative disease management and care coordination. All those platform analytics can raise the relevancy of data interpretations, reducing the amount of time that end users spend piecing together data outputs. Insights gained from big data analysis will drive the digital disruption of the healthcare world, business processes and real-time decision-making. Conclusions A new category of {"}personalised preventative health coaches{"} (Digital Health Advisors) will emerge. These workers will possess the skills and the ability to interpret and understand health and well-being data. They will help their clients avoid chronic and diet-related illness, improve cognitive function, achieve improved mental health and achieve improved lifestyles overall. As the global population ages, such roles will become increasingly important.",

Recent proposals simplify the communication management with graphical views or language extensions but still require programmers to explicitly manage communication. To liberate programmers from explicit communication management, this article revisits heterogeneous distributed shared memory (HDSM) for IoT devices and proposes a compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework, called IoT-HDSM. The framework's compiler unifies heterogeneous memory layouts of different IoT devices, and the runtime system provides a shared memory view for the devices. To support lightweight devices that cannot execute the runtime, the compiler automatically inserts explicit communication instructions into the IoT application. Moreover, to efficiently control concurrent memory accesses without locks, the authors also propose a new annotation called the memory branch, which provides a memory snapshot for each device. This article describes the implementation of three IoT services with IoT-HDSM and shows that IoT-HDSM simplifies shared data management without harming QoS.",

Novel biosensing methodologies offer highly specialised monitoring devices for the specific measurement of individual and multiple parameters covering an animal's physiology as well as monitoring of an animal's environment. These devices are not only highly specific and sensitive for the parameters being analysed, but they are also reliable and easy to use, and can accelerate the monitoring process. Novel biosensors in livestock management provide significant benefits and applications in disease detection and isolation, health monitoring and detection of reproductive cycles, as well as monitoring physiological wellbeing of the animal via analysis of the animal's environment. With the development of integrated systems and the Internet of Things, the continuously monitoring devices are expected to become affordable. The data generated from integrated livestock monitoring is anticipated to assist farmers and the agricultural industry to improve animal productivity in the future. The data is expected to reduce the impact of the livestock industry on the environment, while at the same time driving the new wave towards the improvements of viable farming techniques. This review focusses on the emerging technological advancements in monitoring of livestock health for detailed, precise information on productivity, as well as physiology and well-being.

In this paper, we first investigate the integration of smart home and botanical IoT for creating a better living environment to increase people’s quality of life. First, we point out that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment, while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the affective interaction between greeneries and home users.

The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.",

abstract = "  A smart home is a home environment enriched with sensing, actuation, communication and computation capabilities which permits to adapt it to inhabitants preferences and requirements. Establishing a proper strategy of actuation on the home environment can require complex computational tasks on the sensed data. This is the case of activity recognition, which consists in retrieving high-level knowledge about what occurs in the home environment and about the behaviour of the inhabitants. The inherent complexity of this application domain asks for tools able to properly support the design and implementation phases. This paper proposes a framework for the design and implementation of smart home applications focused on activity recognition in home environments. The framework mainly relies on the Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE) architecture offering basic abstraction entities which easily allow to design and implement Smart Home applications. CASE is a three layered architecture which exploits the distributed multi-agent paradigm and the cloud technology for offering analytics services. Details about how to implement activity recognition onto the CASE architecture are supplied focusing on the low-level technological issues as well as the algorithms and the methodologies useful for the activity recognition. The effectiveness of the framework is shown through a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of a person in a home environment.",

In recent years, wearable systems have led to new applications across all medical fields. The aim of this review is to present current state-of-the-art approach in the field of wearable system based cancer detection and identify key challenges that resist it from clinical adoption. A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45% research articles and 55% manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3%), skin cancer (36.3%), prostate cancer (18.1%), and multi-type cancer (9%). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system. It is well comprehended that upon sincere orientation of all identified challenges, wearable systems would emerge as vital alternative to futuristic cancer detection.

The analysis of biomedical signals for monitoring or diagnosing diseases requires the detection of these peaks, making event detection a crucial step in biomedical signal processing. Many researchers have difficulty detecting these peaks to investigate, interpret and analyze their corresponding events. To date, there is no generic framework that captures these events in a robust, efficient and consistent manner. A new method referred to for the first time as two event-related moving averages ({"}TERMA{"}) involves event-related moving averages and detects events in biomedical signals. The TERMA framework is flexible and universal and consists of six independent LEGO building bricks to achieve high accuracy detection of biomedical events. Results recommend that the window sizes for the two moving averages ( W 1 and W 2 ) have to follow the inequality ( 8 × W 1 ) ≥ W 2 ≥ ( 2 × W 1 ) . Moreover, TERMA is a simple yet efficient event detector that is suitable for wearable devices, point-of-care devices, fitness trackers and smart watches, compared to more complex machine learning solutions.",

Plants are sessile organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation, and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems) of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication aspects of the WSN's, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured. The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access, and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management.

Industry 4.0 and the corresponding industrial Internet of Things are about to generate new waves of process-related data, next to the abundance of event data already present in enterprise systems. However, organizations often fail to convert such data into strategic and tactical intelligence. This is due to the lack of dedicated technologies that are tailored to effectively manage the information on processes encoded in process models and process execution records. Process-related information is a core organizational asset which requires dedicated analytics to unlock its full potential. This paper proposes a framework for devising process querying methods, i.e., techniques for the (automated) management of repositories of designed and executed processes, as well as models that describe relationships between processes. The framework is composed of generic components that can be configured to create a range of process querying methods. The motivation for the framework stems from use cases in the field of Business Process Management. The design of the framework is informed by and validated via a systematic literature review. The framework structures the state of the art and points to gaps in existing research. Process querying methods need to address these gaps to better support strategic decision-making and provide the next generation of Business Intelligence platforms.",

CPS for environment monitoring applications completely transforms human-to-human, human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions with the use of Internet Cloud. A recent trend is to gain assistance from mergers between virtual networking and physical actuation to reliably perform all conventional and complex sensing and communication tasks. Oil and gas pipeline monitoring provides a novel example of the benefits of CPS, providing a reliable remote monitoring platform to leverage environment, strategic and economic benefits. In this paper, we evaluate the applications and technical requirements for seamlessly integrating CPS with sensor network plane from a reliability perspective and review the strategies for communicating information between remote monitoring sites and the widely deployed sensor nodes. Related challenges and issues in network architecture design and relevant protocols are also provided with classification.

And also it is the duty of cloud OS to provide convenient interface for users and applications. However, these two goals are often conflicting because convenient abstraction usually needs more computing resources. Thus, the cloud OS has its own characteristics of resource management and task scheduling for supporting various kinds of cloud applications. The evolution of cloud OS is in fact driven by these two often conflicting goals and finding the right tradeoff between them makes each phase of the evolution happen. In this paper, we have investigated the ways of cloud OS evolution from three different aspects: enabling technology evolution, OS architecture evolution and cloud ecosystem evolution. We show that finding the appropriate APIs (application programming interfaces) is critical for the next phase of cloud OS evolution. Convenient interfaces need to be provided without scarifying efficiency when APIs are chosen. We present an API-driven cloud OS practice, showing the great capability of APIs for developing a better cloud OS and helping build and run the cloud ecosystem healthily.

Vishvakarma (1) Keywords: object detection; object tracking; quadtree; macroblock resizing; monocular camera; directional vector pixel Abstract: In this paper, a high speed, reliable, low memory demanding and precise object detection and tracking algorithm is proposed. The proposed work uses a macroblock of rectangular shape, which is placed in the very first frame of the video to detect and track a single moving object using monocular camera. The macroblocks are positioned in the field of view (FOV) of camera where the probability of occurrence of object is high. After placing macroblocks, a threshold value is examined to detect the presence of objects in the selected macroblocks. Afterwards, a quadtree approach is used to minimize the bounding box and to reduce the pixelation. A tracking algorithm is proposed which illustrates a unique method to find the moving directional vectors. The proposed method is based on macroblock resizing, which demonstrates an accuracy rate of 98.5% with low memory utilization.

Similarly, while machine learning has seen explosive growth in recent years and promises to shift the practice of medicine toward data-intensive and evidence-based decision making, its uptake has been hindered due to the lack of integration between clinical measurements and disease determinations. In this Account, we describe recent developments in the programmable bio-nanochip (p-BNC) system, a biosensor platform with the capacity for learning. The p-BNC is a {"}platform to digitize biology{"} in which small quantities of patient sample generate immunofluorescent signal on agarose bead sensors that is optically extracted and converted to antigen concentrations. The platform comprises disposable microfluidic cartridges, a portable analyzer, automated data analysis software, and intuitive mobile health interfaces. The single-use cartridges are fully integrated, self-contained microfluidic devices containing aqueous buffers conveniently embedded for POC use. A novel fluid delivery method was developed to provide accurate and repeatable flow rates via actuation of the cartridge's blister packs. A portable analyzer instrument was designed to integrate fluid delivery, optical detection, image analysis, and user interface, representing a universal system for acquiring, processing, and managing clinical data while overcoming many of the challenges facing the widespread clinical adoption of LOC technologies. We demonstrate the p-BNC's flexibility through the completion of multiplex assays within the single-use disposable cartridges for three clinical applications: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myocardial infarction. Toward the goal of creating {"}sensors that learn{"}, we have developed and describe here the Cardiac ScoreCard, a clinical decision support system for a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The Cardiac ScoreCard approach comprises a comprehensive biomarker panel and risk factor information in a predictive model capable of assessing early risk and late-stage disease progression for heart attack and heart failure patients. These marker-driven tests have the potential to radically reduce costs, decrease wait times, and introduce new options for patients needing regular health monitoring. Further, these efforts demonstrate the clinical utility of fusing data from information-rich biomarkers and the Internet of Things (IoT) using predictive analytics to generate single-index assessments for wellness/illness status. By promoting disease prevention and personalized wellness management, tools of this nature have the potential to improve health care exponentially.",

Extensive research shows that decision biases can be utilized as effective cues to guide user interaction in single-goal environments. This article is a first step toward understanding the effect of decision biases in multiple-goal environments. This study analyzed data from a field experiment during which a comparison was made between drivers' decisions on parking lots in a single-goal environment and drivers' decisions in a multiple-goal environment when being exposed to the default option bias. The article shows that the default option bias is effective in multiple-goal environments. The results have important implications for the design of human-computer interaction in multiple-goal environments.

abstract = "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received significant attention in recent years and have found a wide range of applications, including structural and environmental monitoring, mobile health, home automation, Internet of Things, and others. As these systems are generally battery operated, major research efforts focus on reducing power consumption, especially for communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the most power-hungry components of a WSN. Moreover, with the advent of energy-neutral systems, the emphasis has shifted toward research in microwatt (or even nanowatt) communication protocols or systems. A significant number of wake-up radio receiver (WUR) architectures have been proposed to reduce the communication power of WSN nodes. In this work, we present an optimized ultra-low power (nanowatt) wake-up receiver for use in WSNs, designed with low-cost off-the-shelf components. The wake-up receiver achieves power consumption of 152&#x00A0;nW (with $-32\,{\text {dBm}}$ sensitivity), sensitivity up to $-55\,{\text {dBm}}$ (with maximum power of $1,2 \upmu{\text {W}}$), latency from $8\;\upmu\text{s}$, tunable frequency, and short commands communication. In addition, a low power solution, which includes addressing capability directly in the wake-up receiver, is proposed. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate low power consumption, functionality, and benefits of the design optimization compared with other solutions, as well as the benefits of addressing false positive (FP) outcomes reduction.",

abstract = "Internet of things (IOT) is emerging as sensing paradigms in many domain-specific monitoring applications in smart cities, such as structural health monitoring (SHM) and smart grid monitoring. Due to the large size of the monitoring objects (e.g., civil structure or the power grid), plenty of sensors need to be deployed and organized to be a large scale of multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which tends to have quite high transmission cost. In-network processing is an efficient way to reduce the transmission cost in WSNs. However, implementing in-network processing for above domain-specific monitoring usually requires to losslessly distribute a dedicate domain-specific algorithm into WSNs, which is much different from most existing in-network processing works. This paper conducts a case study of a classic centralized SHM algorithm, i.e., eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and shows how to losslessly and optimally in-network process ERA, especially the typical feature extraction method, i.e., that is singular value decomposition (SVD) therein, in a WSN. Based on whether the intermediate data can be processed together or not by sensor nodes, we respectively implement tree-based in-network processing of SVD and chain-based in-network processing of SVD in WSNs. We prove that using an appropriate shallow light tree as routes for tree-based in-network processing of SVD, can achieve the approximation ratio ${\text{1}}+\sqrt{2}$ (in terms of transmission cost), while for the chain-based in-network processing of SVD, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms for searching the optimal routes. Extensive simulation results validate the efficiency of these proposed schemes that are customized for SVD-based IOT applications.",

Efficient and effective management of stable COPD is essential to improve quality of life and reduce medical expenditure. The Internet of Things (IoT), a recent breakthrough in communication technology, seems promising in improving health care delivery, but its potential strengths in COPD management remain poorly understood. We have developed a mobile phone-based IoT (mIoT) platform and initiated a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial entitled the 'MIOTIC study' to investigate the influence of mIoT among stable COPD patients. In the MIOTIC study, at least 600 patients with stable GOLD group C or D COPD and with a history of at least two moderate-to-severe exacerbations within the previous year will be randomly allocated to the control group, which receives routine follow-up, or the intervention group, which receives mIoT management. Endpoints of the study include (1) frequency and severity of acute exacerbation; (2) symptomatic evaluation; (3) pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) measurement; (4) exercise capacity; and (5) direct medical cost per year. Results from this study should provide direct evidence for the suitability of mIoT in stable COPD patient management.

The changing level of humidity that occurs in a cycle causes a corresponding change in the ionic conductivity of the sensor, which can be measured electrically. By combining the paper sensor with conventional electronics, data concerning respiration can be transmitted to a nearby smartphone or tablet computer for post‐processing, and subsequently to a cloud server. This means of sensing provides a new, practical method of recording and analyzing patterns of breathing. : A simple paper‐based sensor relying on changes in the humidity caused by breathing was fabricated (see picture).

Park (2) Keywords: u-Disaster; Peer to peer; P2P cloud network; IoT; Disaster situations; Disaster Index; Land Safety Abstract: In order to cope with disaster situations properly, it is very important to identify the disaster scale and provide the accurate information of the site to the appropriate authorities including disaster site and Central Disaster Management Center, on-site command post, etc. and share the information provided. In particular, sharing information on disaster situations should control the disaster quickly to prevent the disaster situation from lasting and expanding. However, in the event of a large-scale disaster, delay is caused in the existing commercial network and therefore, the disaster situation cannot be communicated quickly and accurately. In order to determine the situation exactly in the event of a disaster, safety and connectivity of the network and flow of data are very important. Even if the stability of the network and connection of nodes are resolved in the network of each agency business operator, it is necessary to share the platform between networks for IoT/M2M communication for the smooth flow of data. Recently, the disaster safety net of combining existing disaster standard technology with Ubiquitous Technology and Smart IT such as Tetra of Europe, iDEN of the U.S., etc. has been built for disaster safety communications. In addition, systems useful for demand-centered, site-centered immediate disaster response by using Mobile, SNS, cloud computing, etc. are being built and designed to play an important role in the disaster information system especially through IoT, P2P cloud network, big data, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the P2P cloud network service for IoT based disaster situations information according to the paradigm of the changing times. The proposed service is to combine IoT/M2M network with P2P cloud service for rapid and smooth response in the event of a disaster and provide the results as social services such as SNS. To this end, the wide area wireless disaster information network system has been built in the local and each local network is connected to each other to provide disaster situations by using the server of the disaster area. At this time, each server was to be interconnected via P2P network and to be connected automatically by software-based network in P2P Cloud System. Also, the cognitive cycle was applied for selecting optimal wireless link and router of P2P Cloud-based Disaster Information Network and the danger situations of the disaster area were to be provided to the user by configuring disaster information component for providing services and building central disaster information platform managing it.

A discriminant WSRC (DWSRC) is proposed for large-scale plant species recognition, including two stages. Firstly, several subdictionaries are constructed by dividing the dataset into several similar classes, and a subdictionary is chosen by the maximum similarity between the test sample and the typical sample of each similar class. Secondly, the weighted sparse representation of the test image is calculated with respect to the chosen subdictionary, and then the leaf category is assigned through the minimum reconstruction error. Different from the traditional SRC and its improved approaches, we sparsely represent the test sample on a subdictionary whose base elements are the training samples of the selected similar class, instead of using the generic overcomplete dictionary on the entire training samples. Thus, the complexity to solving the sparse representation problem is reduced. Moreover, DWSRC is adapted to newly added leaf species without rebuilding the dictionary. Experimental results on the ICL plant leaf database show that the method has low computational complexity and high recognition rate and can be clearly interpreted.",

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required.

At the same time, people living with old adults suffering from a progressive brain disorder such as Alzheimer's disease are enduring even more stress and depression than those patients while caring for them. Accordingly, seniors' ability to live independently and comfortably in their current home for as long as possible has been crucial to reduce the societal cost for caregiving and thus give family members peace of mind, called 'aging in place' (AIP). In this paper we present a way of building AIP services using standard-based IoT platforms and heterogeneous IoT products. An AIP service platform is designed and created by combining previous standard-based IoT platforms in a collaborative way. A service composition tool is also created that allows people to create AIP services in an efficient way. To show practical usability of our proposed system, we choose a service scenario for medication compliance and implement a prototype service which could give old adults medication reminder appropriately at the right time (i.e., when it is time to need to take pills) through light and speaker at home but also wrist band and smartphone even outside the home.",

According to the World Health Organization, no link has been found between low levels of exposure to radio waves (as emitted by WiFi devices or mobile phones) and adverse health effects, but reducing exposure has other benefits besides public acceptance, such as reduced interference and improved network performance. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have rarely been studied from an exposure point of view, but their continuing expansion as part of the new Internet of Things vision is slowly bringing them to the spotlight. This work presents a novel evaluation of WSN emissions, using the Exposure Index proposed by the Low EMF Exposure Future Networks (LEXNET) project. Together with this evaluation, a method of reducing exposure by intelligently scheduling WSN transmissions is also proposed. The scheduling method is evaluated using a proposed scenario (compatible with evaluations of other technologies performed in LEXNET) both from a theoretical perspective and in a practical implementation, and results are compared with a baseline solution.

To account for both stationary/weakly nonstationary response under normal conditions (e.g., extratropical winds and/or ambient excitations) and transient/highly nonstationary response under transient events (e.g., earthquakes, windstorms, or time-varying traffic loadings), a hybrid framework is introduced by integrating a new nonstationary SI scheme based on wavelets in tandem with transformed singular value decomposition, and a robust stationary SI scheme called covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification. Extensive numerical simulations as well as analysis of full-scale data are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the scheme. To facilitate expeditious and convenient utilization of this framework in a practical application, a web-enabled approach and its workflow concerning measurements of the worldEs tallest building, Burj Khalifa, are presented. This web approach facilitates automated hybrid SI in near real time as an Internet of Things service, which remotely provides end users (e.g., building owners, managers, engineers, and other stakeholders) with timely information on structural performance and ultimately supports the userEs need in decision making regarding structural operation. It is demonstrated that natural frequencies and damping ratios are successfully identified from the streaming data in near real time under both winds and earthquakes. The identified system properties are very useful for tracking the structureEs health condition in its lifecycle. The resulting probabilistic characterization of the system properties can be used to enhance performance-based structural design and retrofitting.",

Recently, the technology of visible light communication (VLC) has been widely discussed. VLC has several advantages, such as freedom of license, line-of-sight security, and less health concern compared with radio-based systems. In addition, the rapid progress of light emitting diode (LED) technology by solid-state lighting allows VLC to be easily deployed and integrated with the existing lighting infrastructure at low costs. However, VLC, when integrated with lighting infrastructure, is usually for one-way communication and is highly sensitive to external interfering light. Thus, transmitting or broadcasting multiple messages simultaneously over a visible light channel without any preprocessing may result in serious collisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle these problems by optical code division multiple access (CDMA) for VLC. With our approach, a VLC receiver can enter an environment without any prior configuration and can be designed with simple hardware. Even a mobile device with a high-resolution photodiode sensor can be used as a receiver. We demonstrate an application of indoor positioning by querying the location service provider on the Internet with the IDs decoded from the received light signals. The prototyping results reveal some communication properties of CDMA-based VLC and its potential for indoor positioning applications.",

Although the approaches based on wearable sensors have provided high detection rates, some of the potential users are reluctant to wear them and thus their use is not yet normalized. As a consequence, alternative approaches such as vision-based methods have emerged. We firmly believe that the irruption of the Smart Environments and the Internet of Things paradigms, together with the increasing number of cameras in our daily environment, forms an optimal context for vision-based systems. Consequently, here we propose a vision-based solution using Convolutional Neural Networks to decide if a sequence of frames contains a person falling.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc., with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real- or near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems of a living being operate and respond to their environment (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the formation of ‘smart(er) communities’ that are socially connected in new ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the ‘brain drain’ from the countryside and smaller towns to larger metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions.

abstract = "Big Data has emerged as a significant area of study for both practitioners and researchers. Big Data is a term for massive data sets with large structure. In 2012, Big Data passed the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle, attesting the maturity level of this technology and its applications. The aim of this paper is to examine how do researchers grasp the big data concept? We will answer the following questions: How many research papers are produced? What is the annual trend of publications? What are the hot topics in big data research? What are the most investigated big data topics? Why the research is performed? What are the most frequently obtained research artefacts? What does big data research produces? Who are the active authors? Which journals include papers on Big Data? What are the active disciplines? For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on eight dimensions, including the SMACIT (Social Mobile Analytics Cloud Internet of Things) perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a systematic mapping study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications. The results have shown that significant contributions have been made by the research community, attested by a continuous increase in the number of scientific publications that address Big Data. We found that researchers are increasingly involved in research combining Big Data and Analytics, Cloud, Internet of things, mobility or social media. As for quality objectives, besides an interest in performance, other topics as scalability is emerging. Moreover, security and quality aspects become important. Researchers on Big Data provide more algorithms, frameworks, and architectures than other artifacts. Finally, application domains such as earth, energy, medicine, ecology, marketing, and health attract more attention from researchers on big data. A complementary content analysis on a subset of papers sheds some light on the evolving field of big data research. •A multidimensional model on Big Data research.•A systematic mapping study on Big Data research.•Big Data Research may be characterized by eight dimensions.",

With the help of GUI through a PC or smart phone, there are various applications that can be developed for energy saving. This work describes the design and prototype implementation of a wireless PV-powered home energy management system under a DC-distribution environment, which allows remote monitoring of appliances’ energy consumptions and power rate quality. The system can be managed by a central computer, which obtains the energy data based on XBee RF modules that access the sensor measurements of system components. The proposed integrated prototype framework is characterized by low power consumption due to the lack of components and consists of three layers: XBee-based circuit for processing and communication architecture, solar charge controller, and solar-battery-load matching layers. Six precise analogue channels for data monitoring are considered to cover the energy measurements. Voltage, current and temperature analogue signals were accessed directly from the remote XBee node to be sent in real time with a sampling frequency of 11–123 Hz to capture the possible surge power. The performance shows that the developed prototype proves the DC voltage matching concept and is able to provide accurate and precise results.",

The concepts of using technology in our daily life is not new, but with the advancements in technology, the impact of technology in daily activities of a person can be seen in almost all the aspects of life. Today, all aspects of our daily life, be it health of a person, his location, movement, etc. can be monitored and analyzed using information captured from various connected devices. This paper discusses one such use case, which can be implemented by the automobile industry, using technological advancements in the areas of IoT and Analytics. ‘Connected Car’ is a terminology, often associated with cars and other passenger vehicles, which are capable of internet connectivity and sharing of various kinds of data with backend applications. The data being shared can be about the location and speed of the car, status of various parts/lubricants of the car, and if the car needs urgent service or not. Once data are transmitted to the backend services, various workflows can be created to take necessary actions, e.g. scheduling a service with the car service provider, or if large numbers of care are in the same location, then the traffic management system can take necessary action. ’Connected cars’ can also communicate with each other, and can send alerts to each other in certain scenarios like possible crash etc. This paper talks about how the concept of ‘connected cars’ can be used to perform ‘predictive car maintenance’. It also discusses how certain technology components, i.e., Eclipse Mosquito and Eclipse Paho can be used to implement a predictive connected car use case.</p>",

They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately. The algorithms used for each mobile gateway service, and the scenarios where the mobile gateway acts as a communication channel or a smart object are also addressed on this paper.

These will affect non-finalistic (warehouse, archive), diagnostic support (laboratory and image) and finalistic activities (emergency, surgical center, clinics) (2). The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is fundamental in the dimension of the impact of each technology on the structure of healthcare facilities (HCF). In this way, this work intends to evaluate the trends of impact of the new ICT on hospitals’ structure. METHODS: The main technologies under discussion in Management of HCF in Brazillian Health Regulatory Agency were raised. From this survey an impact matrix was built with hospital environmental design and the trends of adequacy of its space. RESULTS: ICT that tend to decrease the physical space are: electronic health record for the archive, use of digital imaging for radiology, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) for the warehouse, point of care and automated laboratory equipment for clinical laboratories. ICT that tend to increase physical space are: Telemedicine for the surgical center, Internet of Things - IoT for Intensive Care Units, beds for emergency and hospitalization. The technologies that present an undefined tendency in relation to physical space are: automatic dispensers of drugs for nursing posts. The use of database servers and the need for network points are still undefined due to the use of Wi-Fi technology and cloud storage. However, it's possible to increase use of electricity and the internet. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the new ICT will have an impact on the planning and building of the future HCF (3). The designs of today's buildings should consider this trend so that the future reality is adequate and the regulatory requirements about HCF should be able to consider it.",

The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics. •Massive IoT multimedia flows must be handled to support efficient cloud services.•IoT multimedia applications are expected to request common content.•A cross-layer multimedia SDN-oriented session control is proposed.•Proposed solution improves delay, jitter, throughput, SSIM and VQM.",

Nowadays the concept of intelligent homes and smart technologies are spreading out and becoming a vital strategy to optimize the energy performance. Specially that the internet is available to all our life aspects including educational system, health care, banking, commercial, industries, mobile applications, etc. The energy sector is one of the important domains to use the internet in the supply and demand sides. As the buildings consume two third of electricity globally, the real-time monitoring, by using the internet, is one of the key factors to manage the energy consumption and to optimize the buildings’ performance. Accordingly, the buildings’ systems have utilized the information technology’s revolution in the last decade in several manners. One of the very interesting synergies is that developing relationship between the energy monitoring and the Internet of Things (IoT) for most of buildings’ sensors, energy meters and building automation systems. These new technologies interact effectively with the Smart Home Energy Management System. It increases its value and ensures securing tangible benefits. As shown through the findings of this study, the level of buildings intelligence will significantly contribute the improvement of energy performance. Not only, the energy demand and the use of energy will be smartly efficient. As a result, the renewable energy systems in such smart homes will be a cost-effective option and the probability to build a net zero energy home becomes materialized and affordable economically.This paper reviews the latest technologies and telecommunication techniques that used in the homes to monitor energy performance. It also discusses a case study in Riyadh – Saudi Arabia about smart home’s technologies, and the impact of using the renewable energy to improve the energy performance compared to the energy benchmark. The main focus will be on the smart technologies; interface and integration of the meters, sensors and monitoring systems with the home energy management system (HEMS).

In order to guarantee security of this data over open networks, a secure data transmission mechanism between WBAN and application provider’s servers is of necessity. Modified medical data does not provide a true reflection of an individuals state of health and its subsequent use for diagnosis could lead to an irreversible medical condition.

We further provide security proof that our scheme provides indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack in random oracle model. Compared with two other Diffie-Hellman based signcryption schemes proposed by Barbosa and Farshim (BF) and another by Yin and Liang (YL), our scheme consumes 46 % and 8 % less energy during signcryption than BF and YL scheme respectively.",

abstract = "Music often plays an important role in people’s daily lives. Because it has the power to affect human emotion, music has gained a place in work environments and in sports training as a way to enhance the performance of particular tasks. Studies have shown that office workers perform certain jobs better and joggers run longer distances when listening to music. However, a personalized music system which can automatically recommend songs according to user’s physiological response remains absent. Therefore, this study aims to establish an intelligent music selection system for individual users to enhance their learning performance. We first created an emotional music database using data analytics classifications. During testing, innovative wearable sensing devices were used to detect heart rate variability (HRV) in experiments, which subsequently guided music selection. User emotions were then analyzed and appropriate songs were selected by using the proposed application software (App). Machine learning was used to record user preference, ensuring accurate and precise classification. Significant results generated through experimental validation indicate that this system generates high satisfaction levels, does not increase mental workload, and improves users’ performance. Under the trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the continuing development of wearable devices, the proposed system could stimulate innovative applications for smart factory, home, and health care.",

abstract = "Many applications and services have emerged in the frame of new Internet of Things paradigm. This novel view has opened the Web services to a variety of devices especially to tiny and resource-constrained devices. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks belong to that kind of devices. Those networks have become one of the more promising technologies to take part in the Future Internet. However, the integration of Sensor and Actuator Networks into the Service Cloud is a hard challenge requiring specific new architectures and protocols. This paper presents a middleware approach addressing this important issue. A Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented Middleware (KASOM) for pervasive embedded networks is proposed. The major aim of KASOM is to offer advanced and enriched pervasive services to everyone connected to Internet. In this sense, KASOM implements mechanisms and protocols which allow managing the knowledge generated in pervasive embedded networks in order to expose it to Internet users in a readable way. General functional requirements of embedded sensor and actuator platforms have been taken into account when designing KASOM, with special attention in energy consumption, memory and bandwidth. The KASOM evaluation and validation will be demonstrated through a real Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network deployment based on integral healthcare services in a sanatorium. Highlights ► We developed a Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented Middleware (KASOM), which is a new approach to integrate pervasive embedded network into the Service Cloud. ► KASOM's characteristics provides to developer several tools which facilitates the design and deployed of services in pervasive network. ► The results from validation tests which was carried out over a healthcare scenario were very promising in terms of QoS and human resources saving.",

Enormous potential of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology has made it feasible to perceive and analyze real time health conditions in ubiquitous manner. Moreover, incorporation of IoT in healthcare industry has led researchers around the world to develop smart applications like mobile healthcare, health-aware recommendations, and intelligent healthcare systems. Inspired from these aspects, this research presents an intelligent healthcare framework based on IoT Technology to provide ubiquitous healthcare to person during his/her workout sessions. The intelligence of the presented framework lies with its ability to analyze real time health conditions during workouts and predict probabilistic health state vulnerability. For predictive purpose, the proposed framework indulges the utilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which is comprised of three phases namely, monitor, learn, and predict. In addition to this, the presented framework is supported by a mathematical foundation to predict probabilistic vulnerability, in terms of Probabilistic State of Vulnerability (PSoV). In order to determine the validity and applicability of the proposed framework, experiments were performed where 5 people with different attributes are monitored for 14 days using numerous smart sensors. Results, upon comparison with various state-of-the-art techniques, depict that the proposed system is superior in performance and is highly effective in delivering healthcare services during workouts.",

We focus on the implementation of a new Smart IoT Gateway designed to allow interconnection and interoperability between heterogeneous devices in the IoT.

In particular, the reliability and effectiveness of the packets transmission will be directly related to the timely rescue of critically ill patients with life-threatening injuries. However, traditional fault-tolerant schemes either have the deficiency of underutilised resources or react too slowly to failures. In future healthcare systems, the medical Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring can integrate sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data techniques to address these problems. It can collect and send patient’s vital parameter signal and safety monitoring information to intelligent terminals and enhance transmission reliability and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a design in healthcare monitoring systems for a proactive reliable data transmission mechanism with resilience requirements in a many-to-one stream model. This Network Coding-based Fault-tolerant Mechanism (NCFM) first proposes a greedy grouping algorithm to divide the topology into small logical units; it then constructs a spanning tree based on random linear network coding to generate linearly independent coding combinations. Numerical results indicate that this transmission scheme works better than traditional methods in reducing the probability of packet loss, the resource redundant rate, and average delay, and can increase the effective throughput rate.</p>",

The prevalent rise of the mobile device and computational technology in the age of information technology offers exciting applications that are attributed to sophisticated, enormously reliable, and most mature CMOS-based electronics. We are accustomed to high performance, cost-effective, multifunctional, and energy-efficient scaled electronics. However, they are rigid, bulky, and brittle. The convolution of flexibility and stretchability in electronics for emerging Internet of Everything application can unleash smart application horizon in unexplored areas, such as robotics, healthcare, smart cities, transport, and entertainment systems. While flexible and stretchable device themes are being remarkably chased, the realization of the fully compliant electronic system is unaddressed. Integration of data processing, storage, communication, and energy management devices complements a compliant system. Here, a comprehensive review is presented on necessity and design criteria for freeform (physically flexible and stretchable) compliant high-performance CMOS electronic systems.",

abstract = "<p>The opportunity of an emerging smart city in post-disaster Christchurch has been explored as a way to improve the quality of life of people suffering Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which is a progressive disease that affects respiratory function. It affects 1 in 15 New Zealanders and is the 4th largest cause of death, with significant costs to the health system. While, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD, long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause and exacerbate it. Currently, we do know little what happens to the patients with COPD after they leave a doctor’s care. By learning more about patients’ movements in space and time, we can better understand the impacts of both the environment and personal mobility on the disease. This research is studying patients with COPD by using GPS-enabled smartphones, combined with the data about their spatiotemporal movements and information about their actual usage of medication in near real-time. We measure environmental data in the city, including air pollution, humidity and temperature and how this may subsequently be associated with COPD symptoms. In addition to the existing air quality monitoring network, to improve the spatial scale of our analysis, we deployed a series of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) air quality sensors as well. The study demonstrates how health devices, smartphones and IoT sensors are becoming a part of a new health data ecosystem and how their usage could provide information about high-risk health hotspots, which, in the longer term, could lead to improvement in the quality of life for patients with COPD.</p>",

abstract = "Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients&#x2019; vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users&#x2019; sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users&#x2019; side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way&#x2014;which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users&#x2019; health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.",

Condition monitoring systems have been widely applied to many industries to acquire operation and equipment related data, through which machine health state can be evaluated. One of the challenges of predicting future machine health lies in extracting the right features that are correlated well with the fault progression/degradation. We propose an enhanced restricted Boltzmann machine with a novel regularization term to automatically generate features that are suitable for remaining useful life prediction. The regularization term tries to maximize the trendability of the output features, which potentially better represent the degradation pattern of a system. The proposed method is benchmarked with regular restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm and principal component analysis. The generated features are used as input to a similarity-based method for life prediction. Run-to-failure datasets collected from two rotating systems are used for validation.",

To access the spectrum safely, the security aspect of spectrum utilization should be carefully addressed. A well-known threat to the spectrum utilization is the primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in which the attackers emulate as the primary users to obtain spectrum opportunities. To defend this threat, in this paper, we propose a triple threshold energy detection (TTED) to identify the PUEA. Based on the TTED, legitimate devices are allowed to access the available channels when the licensed channel is idle or occupied by attackers. To evaluate our proposed access scheme, we derive the achievable throughput while the average transmission time is fixed and exponential distributed, respectively.

Among them, wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs) have been used in the personalized healthcare systems (PHSs). In recent years, professionals use their mobile devices to access the data collected from sensors which are placed in or on patients’ bodies. Due to the danger of wireless transmission circumstance, the security of the data which are collected by the sensors and also transmitted to the doctors faces challenges. In the past decade, many authentication schemes for WMSNs are proposed. However, security disadvantages have been found in such schemes. To overcome the historical security problems, we propose a robust and lightweight authentication scheme for WMSNs, which meets the common security requirements, and keeps away user tracking from attackers. The popular tool Proverif is employed to express that our scheme resists the simulated attacks. Also, the informal security analysis is demonstrated. With the comparison to several very recent schemes and simulation by NS-3, the proposed scheme is suitable for PHSs. •A lightweight two-factor authentication scheme using WMSNs away from being tracked is presented.•We use the famous tool Proverif to prove that our scheme is secure against the common attacks.•The informal analysis and performance comparison with recent schemes show that ours is the best.•The simulation with NS-3 shows that our scheme is applicable for practice.",

Steinberg, Petar Kassal, Irena Kerekovic, Ivana Murkovic Steinberg Abstract: Wireless chemical sensors are used as analytical devices in homeland defence, home-based healthcare, food logistics and more generally for the Sensor Internet of Things (SIoT). Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system - the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) - and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the 'missing link' in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R.sup.2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things.

Fueled by the rapid development of the Internet of Things, it is increasing important to provide robust and high-quality urban wireless mesh networks (WMNs) for public service. However, WMNs encounter frequent link failures during their lifetime in practical use as a consequence of large-scale wireless interference, block buildings, etc., which deeply influences the performance of the network. These failures should be recovered in time or prevented with foresight. Tremendous labor and management cost should also be avoided. In this paper, we focus on an interesting phenomenon called {"}loop effect{"} in urban WMNs which may cause frequent link failures. A scheme named anti-loop network reconfiguration system (ALRS) for link recovery in municipal WMNs with QoS requirement is proposed and analyzed. ALRS takes the historical information into consideration to achieve maximum throughput, interference avoidance and self-reconfiguration with no requirement on mesh node antennas. Our evaluation results show that ALRS outperforms all the existing techniques in improving network throughput and reducing the occurrence probability of continuous link failure.

The proposed system is highly energy efficient that consumes only 165 mW power and runs on 5 VDC source. The implemented solution employs an IR thermographic sensor of industry grade along with AT Mega 328 breakout board. Ordinarily, the IR sensor is placed 1.5--30 cm away from human forehead (i.e., non-invasive) and measured the raw data in terms of skin and ambient temperature which is then converted using appropriate approximation formula to find out core body temperature. The raw data is plotted, visualized, and stored instantaneously in a local machine by means of two tools such as Makerplot, and JAVA-JAR. The test is performed when human object is in complete rest and after 10 min of walk. Achieved results are compared with the CoreTemp CM-210 sensor (by Terumo, Japan) which is calculated to be 0.7 [degrees]F different from the average value of BCT, obtained by the proposed IR sensor system. Upon a slight modification, the presented model can be connected with a remotely placed Internet of Things cloud service, which may be useful to inform and predict the user's core body temperature through a probabilistic view.

We propose that Internet of Things technology can be used to promote basic nursing care in the hospital environment by improving the quality of care and patient safety. Objectives: To introduce the concept of Internet of Things to nursing audience by exploring the state of the art of Internet of Things based technology for basic nursing care in the hospital environment. Data sources and review methods: Seeping review methodology following Arksey & O'Malley's stages from one to five were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of current literature. We searched eight databases using predefined search terms. A total of 5030 retrievals were found which were screened for duplications and relevancy to the study topic. 265 papers were chosen for closer screening of the abstracts and 93 for full text evaluation. 62 papers were selected for the review. The constructs of the papers, the Internet of Things based innovations and the themes of basic nursing care in hospital environment were identified. Results: Most of the papers included in the review were peer-reviewed proceedings of technological conferences or articles published in technological journals. The Internet of Things based innovations were presented in methodology papers or tested in case studies and usability assessments. Innovations were identified in several topics in four basic nursing care activities: comprehensive assessment, periodical clinical reassessment, activities of daily living and care management. Conclusions: Internet of Things technology is providing innovations for the use of basic nursing care although the innovations are emerging and still in early stages. Internet of things is yet vaguely adopted in nursing. The possibilities of the Internet of Things are not yet exploited as well as they could.

Healthcare via internet-of-things (IoT) for protection against consumption of contaminated foods was demonstrated via immuno-analysis of pathogenic bacteria and the sharing of results using a mobile device. As wireless internet has spread widely over the world, it can be readily used to communicate information related to, for example, human health. Indeed, some institutes have demonstrated the measurement of physical vital signals (e.g., temperature, pulse, and heartbeat) of the body for monitoring through a smartphone. However, biochemical analytes such as proteins and bacteria are currently difficult to measure based on antigen-antibody binding due to several technological barriers. Among them, the terminal unit of detection for, for instance, pathogens is mostly bulky, insensitive, or even expensive for sophisticated devices. We have studied the use of CMOS image sensor (CIS) for detecting the signal produced from an immuno-analytical system, which could resolve the detection issue hindering monitoring via IoT. In this study, an immunosensor system using CIS for detection means was fabricated to pocket-sized dimensions and then employed for determining a food-borne pathogen, the Vibrio species, in real samples. The analysis was controlled and monitored using a smartphone that was also used to upload the result as data to the internet server for sharing with the public.

We propose that Internet of Things technology can be used to promote basic nursing care in the hospital environment by improving the quality of care and patient safety. ObjectivesTo introduce the concept of Internet of Things to nursing audience by exploring the state of the art of Internet of Things based technology for basic nursing care in the hospital environment. Data sources and review methodsScoping review methodology following Arksey & O’Malley’s stages from one to five were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of current literature. We searched eight databases using predefined search terms. A total of 5030 retrievals were found which were screened for duplications and relevancy to the study topic. 265 papers were chosen for closer screening of the abstracts and 93 for full text evaluation. 62 papers were selected for the review. The constructs of the papers, the Internet of Things based innovations and the themes of basic nursing care in hospital environment were identified. ResultsMost of the papers included in the review were peer-reviewed proceedings of technological conferences or articles published in technological journals. The Internet of Things based innovations were presented in methodology papers or tested in case studies and usability assessments. Innovations were identified in several topics in four basic nursing care activities: comprehensive assessment, periodical clinical reassessment, activities of daily living and care management. ConclusionsInternet of Things technology is providing innovations for the use of basic nursing care although the innovations are emerging and still in early stages. Internet of things is yet vaguely adopted in nursing. The possibilities of the Internet of Things are not yet exploited as well as they could.

Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are sessile organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation, and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems) of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication aspects of the WSN's, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured. The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access, and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management.

Wireless communications are key for taking full advantage of sensor networks but implies new challenges in the security and privacy of communications. Security in wireless sensor networks is a major challenge for extending its applications. Moreover, the restrictive processing capabilities of sensor nodes have made the encryption techniques devised for conventional networks not feasible. In such setting, symmetric‐key ciphers are preferred for key management in wireless sensor network; key distribution is therefore an issue solved by means of the protocols presented in this paper. Diffie–Hellman protocol (since its development) has been in the most important cryptographic primitive being the base for plenty of security protocols. In this paper, we proposed three key exchange protocols derived from the Diffie–Hellman method, applied to elliptic curves, named ECGDH‐1, ECGDH‐2, and ECGDH‐3.

However, a contradiction between achieving low voltage operation and having stable performance severely hinder the technology to become commercially viable. This work shows that, by reducing the sub-gap density of states (DOS) at the channel for low operation voltage and using a proper low-k non-polar polymer dielectric layer, such an issue can be addressed. Stable electrical properties after either being placed for weeks or continuously prolonged bias stressing for hours in ambient air are achieved for all solution processed unencapsulated OFETs with the channel being exposed to the ambient air for analyte detection. The fabricated device presents a steep subthreshold swing less than 100 mV/decade, and an ON/OFF ratio of 10(6) at a voltage swing of 3 V. The low voltage and stable operation allows the sensor made of the OFET to be incorporated into a battery-powered electronic system for continuously reliable sensing of ammonia vapor in ambient air with very small power consumption of about 50 nW.",

We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network.

Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes.

abstract = "<p>AbstractThis study proposes a near-real-time hybrid framework for system identification (SI) of structures using data from structural health monitoring systems. To account for both stationary/weakly nonstationary response under normal conditions (e.g., extratropical winds and/or ambient excitations) and transient/highly nonstationary response under transient events (e.g., earthquakes, windstorms, or time-varying traffic loadings), a hybrid framework is introduced by integrating a new nonstationary SI scheme based on wavelets in tandem with transformed singular value decomposition, and a robust stationary SI scheme called covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification. Extensive numerical simulations as well as analysis of full-scale data are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the scheme. To facilitate expeditious and convenient utilization of this framework in a practical application, a web-enabled approach and its workflow concerning measurements of the world’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa, are presented. This web approach facilitates automated hybrid SI in near real time as an Internet of Things service, which remotely provides end users (e.g., building owners, managers, engineers, and other stakeholders) with timely information on structural performance and ultimately supports the user’s need in decision making regarding structural operation. It is demonstrated that natural frequencies and damping ratios are successfully identified from the streaming data in near real time under both winds and earthquakes. The identified system properties are very useful for tracking the structure’s health condition in its lifecycle. The resulting probabilistic characterization of the system properties can be used to enhance performance-based structural design and retrofitting.</p>",

abstract = "Bearing is one of the most critical components in most electrical and power drives. Effective bearing fault diagnosis is important for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and operating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitoring systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals acquired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification performance on various bearing faults under different working conditions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the presented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds.",

The inherent closed‐loop responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications make them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) hosted in cloud data centers are becoming the vital engine for real‐time data processing and analytics in any IoT software architecture. But the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT applications and data streams. Here, we propose , a real‐time IoT benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as modular microbenchmarks. Further, we define composed from these tasks based on common patterns of data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and predictive analytics that are intrinsic to the closed‐loop IoT decision‐making life cycle. These are coupled with sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and smart health, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10 000 messages/second from up to 3 million sensors.

This number not only includes TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones, but also billions of embedded sensors that will make up the {"}Internet of Things{"} and enable a whole new range of intelligent services in domains such as manufacturing, health, smart homes, logistics, etc. To some extent, intelligence such as data processing or access control can be placed on the devices themselves. Alternatively, functionalities can be outsourced to the cloud. In reality, there is no single solution that fits all needs. Cooperation between devices, intermediate infrastructures (local networks, access networks, global networks) and/or cloud systems is needed in order to optimally support IoT communication and IoT applications. Through distributed intelligence the right communication and processing functionality will be available at the right place. The first part of this paper motivates the need for such distributed intelligence based on shortcomings in typical IoT systems. The second part focuses on the concept of sensor function virtualization, a potential enabler for distributed intelligence, and presents solutions on how to realize it.

The IoT represents the convergence of advances in miniaturization, wireless connectivity, and increased data storage and is driven by various sensors. Sensors detect and measure changes in position, temperature, light, and many others; furthermore, they are necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating “things” that can report on their status and often interact with their environment. Application and service development methods and frameworks are required to support the realization of solutions covering data collection, transmission, data processing, analysis, reporting, and advanced querying. This paper introduces the SensorHUB framework that utilizes the state-of-the-art open source technologies and provides a unified tool chain for IoT related application and service development. SensorHUB is both a method and an environment to support IoT related application and service development; furthermore, it supports the data monetization approach, that is, provides a method to define data views on top of different data sources and analyzed data.

In cellular network evolution, the long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) networks including machine-type communication (MTC) features (named LTE-M) provide a promising infrastructure for a proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) sensing platform. However, LTE-M may not be optimally exploited for directly supporting such low-data-rate devices in terms of energy efficiency since it depends on core technologies of LTE that are originally designed for high-data-rate services. Focusing on this circumstance, we propose a novel adaptive modulation and coding selection (AMCS) algorithm to address the energy consumption problem in the LTE-M based IoT-sensing platform. The proposed algorithm determines the optimal pair of MCS and the number of primary resource blocks (#PRBs), at which the transport block size is sufficient to packetize the sensing data within the minimum transmit power. In addition, a quantity-oriented resource planning (QORP) technique that utilizes these optimal MCS levels as main criteria for spectrum allocation has been proposed for better adapting to the sensing node requirements. The simulation results reveal that the proposed approach significantly reduces the energy consumption of IoT sensing nodes and #PRBs up to 23.09% and 25.98%, respectively.",

abstract = "Background Information and communication technology (ICT) has transformed the health care field worldwide. One of the main drivers of this change is the electronic health record (EHR). However, there are still open issues and challenges because the EHR usually reflects the partial view of a health care provider without the ability for patients to control or interact with their data. Furthermore, with the growth of mobile and ubiquitous computing, the number of records regarding personal health is increasing exponentially. This movement has been characterized as the Internet of Things (IoT), including the widespread development of wearable computing technology and assorted types of health-related sensors. This leads to the need for an integrated method of storing health-related data, defined as the personal health record (PHR), which could be used by health care providers and patients. This approach could combine EHRs with data gathered from sensors or other wearable computing devices. This unified view of patients' health could be shared with providers, who may not only use previous health-related records but also expand them with data resulting from their interactions. Another PHR advantage is that patients can interact with their health data, making decisions that may positively affect their health. Objective This work aimed to explore the recent literature related to PHRs by defining the taxonomy and identifying challenges and open questions. In addition, this study specifically sought to identify data types, standards, profiles, goals, methods, functions, and architecture with regard to PHRs. Methods The method to achieve these objectives consists of using the systematic literature review approach, which is guided by research questions using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and context (PICOC) criteria. Results As a result, we reviewed more than 5000 scientific studies published in the last 10 years, selected the most significant approaches, and thoroughly surveyed the health care field related to PHRs. We developed an updated taxonomy and identified challenges, open questions, and current data types, related standards, main profiles, input strategies, goals, functions, and architectures of the PHR. Conclusions All of these results contribute to the achievement of a significant degree of coverage regarding the technology related to PHRs.",

We propose a universal model for bias-stress (BS)-induced instability in the inkjet-printed carbon nanotube (CNT) networks used in field-effect transistors (FETs). By combining two experimental methods, i.e., a comparison between air and vacuum BS tests and interface trap extraction, BS instability is explained regardless of either the BS polarity or ambient condition, using a single platform constituted by four key factors: OH− adsorption/desorption followed by a change in carrier concentration, electron concentration in CNT channel corroborated with H2O/O2 molecules in ambient, charge trapping/detrapping, and interface trap generation. Under negative BS (NBS), the negative threshold voltage shift (ΔVT) is dominated by OH− desorption, which is followed by hole trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. Under positive BS (PBS), the positive ΔVT is dominated by OH− adsorption, which is followed by electron trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. This instability is compensated by interface trap extraction; PBS instability is slightly more complicated than NBS instability. Furthermore, our model is verified using device simulation, which gives insights on how much each mechanism contributes to BS instability. Our result is potentially useful for the design of highly stable CNT-based flexible circuits in the Internet of Things wearable healthcare era.",

It consists of economically powered, wireless and implanted medical monitoring sensor nodes, which are designed to continually collect the medical information of the target patients. Multichannel is often used in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes and the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention. The health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink node (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health emergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for multichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to meet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links. As a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the scheduled lossy links. Besides, potential collisions in the schedules also incur considerable delay in delivering the sensing data. In this paper, we propose a novel deadline-driven Link quality Aware Channel Assignment scheme (LACA), where link quality, deadlines and collisions are jointly considered. LACA prioritizes links with urgent deadlines and heavy collisions. Besides, LACA allows the exploitation of the spare slots for retransmissions on lossy links, which can further reduce the retransmission delay. Extensive simulation experiments show that compared to the existing approaches, LACA can better utilize the wireless spectrum and achieve higher packet delivery ratio before the deadline.",

abstract = "Ultra-low power operation and extreme energy efficiency are strong requirements for a number of high-growth application areas, such as E-health, Internet of Things, and wearable Human–Computer Interfaces. A promising approach to achieve up to one order of magnitude of improvement in energy efficiency over current generation of integrated circuits is near-threshold computing. However, frequency degradation due to aggressive voltage scaling may not be acceptable across all performance-constrained applications. Thread-level parallelism over multiple cores can be used to overcome the performance degradation at low voltage. Moreover, enabling the processors to operate on-demand and over a wide supply voltage and body bias ranges allows to achieve the best possible energy efficiency while satisfying a large spectrum of computational demands. In this work we present the first ever implementation of a 4-core cluster fabricated using conventional-well 28nm UTBB FD-SOI technology. The multi-core architecture we present in this work is able to operate on a wide range of supply voltages starting from 0.44V to 1.2V. In addition, the architecture allows a wide range of body bias to be applied from −1.8V to 0.9V. The peak energy efficiency 60 GOPS/W is achieved at 0.5V supply voltage and 0.5V forward body bias. Thanks to the extended body bias range of conventional-well FD-SOI technology, high energy efficiency can be guaranteed for a wide range of process and environmental conditions. We demonstrate the ability to compensate for up to 99.7% of chips for process variation with only ±0.2V of body biasing, and compensate temperature variation in the range −40°C to 120°C exploiting −1.1V to 0.8V body biasing. When compared to leading-edge near-threshold RISC processors optimized for extremely low power applications, the multi-core architecture we propose has 144× more performance at comparable energy efficiency levels. Even when compared to other low-power processors with comparable performance, including those implemented in 28nm technology, our platform provides 1.4× to 3.7× better energy efficiency.",

Abstract Acoustic tomography for urban tree inspection typically uses stress wave data to reconstruct tomographic images for the trunk cross section using interpolation algorithm. This traditional technique does not take into account the stress wave velocity patterns along tree height. In this study, we proposed an analytical model for the wave velocity in the longitudinal--radial (LR) plane of a live tree. Both field and laboratory stress wave testing were conducted to determine the stress wave velocity patterns in healthy and defective trees. The results showed that the ratio of the wave velocity at a propagation path angle [theta] (with respect to the radial direction) to the radial velocity in healthy trees approximated a second-order parabolic curve with respect to the symmetric axis ([theta]= 0). Our analysis of the velocity patterns indicated that the measured velocities in healthy trees were in a good agreement with the theoretical models. The results of this preliminary study indicated that the stress wave velocity patterns can be used to diagnosis internal defects in urban trees and improve the accuracy of 3D tomographic images in tree inspection applications.

abstract = "In this paper, a novel infra-red (IR) sensitive Er modified poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) (Er-PVDF) film is developed for converting both mechanical and thermal energies into useful electrical power. The addition of Er to PVDF is shown to improve piezoelectric properties due to the formation of a self-polarized ferroelectric β-phase and the creation of an electret-like porous structure. In addition, we demonstrate that Er acts to enhance heat transfer into the Er-PVDF film due to its excellent infrared absorbance, which, leads to rapid and large temperature fluctuations and improved pyroelectric energy transformation. We demonstrate the potential of this novel material for mechanical energy harvesting by creating a durable ferroelectret energy harvester/nanogenerator (FTNG). The high thermal stability of the β-phase enables the FTNG to harvest large temperature fluctuations (ΔT ~ 24 K). Moreover, the superior mechanosensitivity, S ~ 3.4 VPa of the FTNG enables the design of a wearable self-powered health-care monitoring system by human-machine integration. The combination of rare-earth ion, Er with the ferroelectricity of PVDF provides a new and robust approach for delivering smart materials and structures for self-powered wireless technologies, sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",

abstract = "The needs for efficient and scalable community health awareness model become a crucial issue in today’s health care applications. Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay.",

abstract = "Autism is a complex developmental disorder that affects approximately 1 in 68 children (according to the recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-CDC) in the U.S., and has become the fastest growing category of special education. Each student with autism comes with her or his own unique needs and an array of behaviors and habits that can be severe and which interfere with everyday tasks. Autism is associated with intellectual disability, impairments in social skills, and physical health issues such as sleep and abdominal disturbances. We have designed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) framework named WearSense that leverages the sensing capabilities of modern smartwatches to detect stereotypic behaviors in children with autism. In this work, we present a study that used the inbuilt accelerometer of a smartwatch to detect three behaviors, including hand flapping, painting, and sibbing that are commonly observed in children with autism. In this feasibility study, we recruited 14 subjects to record the accelerometer data from the smartwatch worn on the wrist. The processing part extracts 34 different features in each dimension of the three-axis accelerometer, resulting in 102 features. Using and comparing various classification techniques revealed that an ensemble of 40 decision trees has the best accuracy of around 94.6%. This accuracy shows the quality of the data collected from the smartwatch and feature extraction methods used in this study. The recognition of these behaviors by using a smartwatch would be helpful in monitoring individuals with autistic behaviors, since the smartwatch can send the data to the cloud for comprehensive analysis and also to help parents, caregivers, and clinicians make informed decisions.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) networks are the pillar of recent novel scenarios, such as smart cities or e-healthcare applications. Among other challenges, these networks cover the deployment and interaction of small devices with constrained capabilities and Internet protocol (IP)-based networking connectivity. These constrained devices usually require connection to the Internet to exchange information (e.g., management or sensing data) or access network services. However, only authenticated and authorized devices can, in general, establish this connection. The so-called authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) services are in charge of performing these tasks on the Internet. Thus, it is necessary to deploy protocols that allow constrained devices to verify their credentials against AAA infrastructures. The Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) has been standardized by the Internet engineering task force (IETF) to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides flexible authentication upon the presence of AAA. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first deep study of the feasibility of EAP/PANA for network access control in constrained devices. We provide light-weight versions and implementations of these protocols to fit them into constrained devices. These versions have been designed to reduce the impact in standard specifications. The goal of this work is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of EAP/PANA in IoT devices; (2) to provide the scientific community with the first light-weight interoperable implementation of EAP/PANA for constrained devices in the Contiki operating system (Contiki OS), called PANATIKI. The paper also shows a testbed, simulations and experimental results obtained from real and simulated constrained devices.",

Medical community needs to extract precise information from that large amount of data. Currently ICT approaches do not provide a methodology for content-based medical images retrieval and classification. On the other hand, from the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, the ICT medical data can be produced by several devices. Produced data complies with all Big Data features and constraints. The IoT guidelines put at the center of the system a new smart software to manage and transform Big Data in a new understanding form. This paper describes a text based indexing system for mammographic images retrieval and classification. The system deals with text (structured reports) and images (mammograms) mining and classification in a typical Department of Radiology. DICOM structured reports, containing free text for medical diagnosis, have been analyzed and labeled in order to classify the corresponding mammographic images. Information Retrieval process is based on some text manipulation techniques, such as light semantic analysis, stop-word removing, and light medical natural language processing. The system includes also a Search Engine module, based on a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of Specificity and Sensibility. Two more indexes have been computed in order to assess the system robustness: the Az (Area under ROC Curve) index and the σAz (Az standard error) index. The dataset is composed of healthy and pathological DICOM structured reports. Two use case scenarios are presented and described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. •Text based indexing system for mammographic image retrieval and classification.•Accurate information extraction from large amount of data.•Bayesian Naive classifier to improve Search Engine results.•Web service for mammographic structured reports indexing and related images labeling.•Medical Decision Support Systems.",

abstract = "The Web in the Internet today&#x2014;especially when it comes to the Internet of Things and cloud computing&#x2014;is the Web of resources. A photo album, an appointment calendar, a telephone bill, a health record are all resource examples, listed here in the increasing order of expected privacy protection. A few properties of these resources define the roles of three major actors: The resources belong to their owner, they are hosted by the service provider, and they increasingly need to be shared (say, to support mash-up) with consumers. Owners authorize consumers' access to their resources, which providers then grant to the consumers upon authenticating them and checking for proper authorization. In the past, this was achieved by maintaining an access control list for each resource at the service provider. Typically, such a list specifies all consumers along with their privileges. Emerging trends in social networking and cloud computing require elasticity, or, in other words, the ability to grant resource access to new consumers on the fly. Naturally, this comes with ever-increasing requirements for privacy, which dictate strong authentication of all actors involved as well as cryptographic protection of the involved communication sessions. We share the industry expectation that the technology that solves the above problem will be a major enabler for applications based on technologies that range from social networking, to video-on-demand, to health care, to smart metering, and&#x2014;especially&#x2014;to cloud computing.

It is a new type of mobile cloud computing (MCC). MAC is deemed to be a candidate blueprint for future compute-intensive applications with the aim of delivering high functionalities and rich impressive experience to mobile users. However, MAC is yet in its infancy, and a comprehensive survey of the domain is still lacking. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art research efforts carried out in the MAC domain. We analyze several problems inhibiting the adoption of MAC and review corresponding solutions by devising a taxonomy. Moreover, MAC roots are analyzed and taxonomized as architectural components, applications, objectives, characteristics, execution model, scheduling type, formation technologies, and node types. The similarities and differences among existing proposed solutions by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages are also investigated. We also compare the literature based on objectives. Furthermore, our study advocates that the problems stem from the intrinsic characteristics of MAC by identifying several new principles. Lastly, several open research challenges such as incentives, heterogeneity-ware task allocation, mobility, minimal data exchange, and security and privacy are presented as future research directions.

abstract = "Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application’s interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

As a result, large amounts of imaging data are readily available. This presents great challenges on the state-of-the-art practices in process monitoring and quality control. Conventional statistical process control (SPC) focuses on key characteristics of the product or process and is rather limited to handle complex structures of high-dimensional imaging data. New SPC methods and tools are urgently needed to extract useful information from in situ image profiles for process monitoring and quality control. In this study, we developed a novel dynamic network scheme to represent, model, and control time-varying image profiles. Potts model Hamiltonian approach is introduced to characterize community patterns and organizational behaviors in the dynamic network. Further, new statistics are extracted from network communities to characterize and quantify dynamic structures of image profiles. Finally, we design and develop a new control chart, namely, network-generalized likelihood ratio chart, to detect the change point of the underlying dynamics of complex processes. The proposed methodology is implemented and evaluated for real-world applications in ultraprecision machining and biomanufacturing processes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively characterize and monitor the variations in complex structures of time-varying image data. The new dynamic network SPC method is shown to have strong potentials for general applications in a diverse set of domains with in situ imaging data.

DPHK predicts and sends predicted data at one time instead of sending the triggered data of these sensor nodes which people is going to pass in several times. Firstly, our system learns the knowledge of transition probability among sensor nodes from the historical binary motion data through data mining. Secondly, it stores the corresponding knowledge in each sensor node based on a special storage mechanism. Thirdly, each sensor node applies HMM (hidden Markov model) algorithm to predict the sensor node locations people will arrive at according to the receivedmessage. At last, these sensor nodes send their triggered data and the predicted data to the sink node. The significances of DPHK are as follows: (a) the procedure of DPHK is distributed (b) it effectively reduces the connection between sensor nodes and sink node. The time complexities of the proposed algorithms are analyzed and the performance is evaluated by some designed experiments in a smart environment.

Design: A futures perspective is adopted to foresight business models of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled healthcare sector by using business models as a futures business research tool. In doing so, business models is coupled with one of the most prominent foresight methodologies, Causal Layered Analysis (CLA). Qualitative analysis provides deeper understanding of the phenomenon through the layers of CLA; litany, social causes, worldview and myth. Findings: It is di cult to predict the far future for a technology oriented sector like healthcare. This paper presents three scenarios for short-, medium- and long-term future. Based on these scenarios we also present a set of business model elements for different future time frames. This paper shows a way to combine business models with CLA, a foresight methodology; in order to apply business models in futures business research. Besides offering early results for futures business research, this study proposes a conceptual space to work with individual business models for managerial stakeholders. Originality / Value: Much research on business models has offered conceptualization of the phenomenon, innovation through business model and transformation of business models. However, existing literature does not o er much on using business model as a futures research tool.

It examines the organizational dynamics of IoMT and develops a conceptual model for quality of experience (QoE) in user acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the information systems success model of quality factor as an analytical framework and extends it beyond the individual user experience (UX) to include an organization-level perspective. Interviews are conducted with relevant stakeholders for sociotechnical inquiries; a survey identifies user factors in IoMT. Findings The sociotechnical analysis sheds light on how IoMT has been accepted and stabilized in the healthcare sector. It shows the complex interaction between the social and technical aspects of IoMT by highlighting the co-evolution, interaction, and interface of devices that constitute the next-generation network environment. The UX model conceptualizes QoE specific to medical informatics. Research limitations/implications Given the sociotechnical nature of this investigation, another approach to adoption of IoMT innovations was worth investigating to determine effective integration. Practical implications IoMT needs to be meaningful if they are to be sustainable and they need to offer quality of services and QoE no matter the location or demographic in which they are used. Originality/value With a dual-level analysis, the study provides a comprehensive view of the IoMT development process by investigating the organizational dynamics, in addition to the UX, of IoMT. The results provide a basis for developing future IoMT services with QoE requirements, as well as for clarifying sociotechnical dynamics.",

This can substantially expand the scope of applications, both in number and in value. But first, translation into applications requires a base of system functions (instrumentation, computation, power management, communication). These cannot be realized on the desired scale by large-area electronics alone. It is necessary to combine large-area electronics with high-performance, high-efficiency technologies, such as crystalline silicon CMOS, within hybrid systems. Scalable hybrid systems require rethinking the subsystem architectures from the start by considering how the technologies should be interfaced, on both a functional and physical level. To explore platform architectures along with the supporting circuits and devices, we consider as an application driver, a self-powered sheet for high-resolution structural health monitoring (of bridges and buildings). Top-down evaluation of design alternatives within the hybrid design space and pursuit of template architectures exposes circuit functions and device optimizations traditionally overlooked by bottom-up approaches alone.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

Partnering with Validic, a digital health platform designed to collect and deliver personal health data from mobile applications securely into electronic health record (EHR) systems, Sutter Health was able to set up a workflow to integrate PGHD continuously with EHR data. An additional benefit of the program is that the increased understanding of patients enables a dynamic pull between care managers and patients to identify cases that could turn critical and stratify risk for population health management. Though the Sutter Health pilot hasn't been operational long enough to generate any meaningful benefits, initial results indicate that new use cases are emerging beyond chronic disease management.",

However, to achieve better health outcome, various devices or services need to work together. This coordination among services remains challenge, due to their variations and complexities. To address this issue, we have proposed an ontology-based framework for interactive self-assessment of RESTful e-health services. Unlike existing e-health service frameworks where they had tightly coupling between services, as well as their data schemas were difficult to change and extend in the future. In our work, the loosely coupling among services and flexibility of each service are achieved through the design and implementation based on HYDRA vocabulary and REST principles. We have implemented clinical knowledge through the combination of OWL-DL and SPARQL rules. All of these services evolve independently; their interfaces are based on REST principles, especially HATEOAS constraints. We have demonstrated how to apply our framework for interactive self-assessment in e-health applications. We have shown that it allows the medical knowledge to drive the system workflow according to the event-driven principles. New data schema can be maintained during run-time.

Liu, Jun Luo, Ooi Keng-Boon Abstract: Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an internet of things technology that provides many benefits to the healthcare industry's supply chain. However, a challenge faced by healthcare industry is the limited adoption and use of RFID by physicians and nurses. This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding the acceptance of RFID in the healthcare industry.

The principal purpose of this global connection is to provide context awareness for the purpose of bringing convenience to a patient's life and more effectively implementing clinical processes. In health care, monitoring of biosignals of a patient has to be continuously performed while the patient moves inside and outside the hospital. Also, to monitor the accurate location and biosignals of the patient, appropriate mobility management is necessary to maintain connection between the patient and the hospital network. In this paper, a binding update scheme on PMIPv6, which reduces signal traffic during location updates by Virtual LMA (VLMA) on the top original Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) Domain, is proposed to reduce the total cost. If a Mobile Node (MN) moves to a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-located boundary of an adjacent LMA domain, the MN changes itself into a virtual mode, and this movement will be assumed to be a part of the VLMA domain. In the proposed scheme, MAGs eliminate global binding updates for MNs between LMA domains and significantly reduce the packet loss and latency by eliminating the handoff between LMAs. In conclusion, the performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme improves performance significantly versus PMIPv6 and HMIPv6 in terms of the binding update rate per user and average handoff latency.</p>",

abstract = "The future Internet is expected to connect billions of people, things and services having the potential to deliver a new set of applications by deriving new insights from the data generated from these diverse data sources. This highly interconnected global network brings new types of challenges in analysing and making sense of data. This is why machine learning is expected to be a crucial technology in the future, in making sense of data, in improving business and decision making, and in doing so, providing the potential to solve a wide range of problems in health care, telecommunications, urban computing, and others. Machine learning algorithms can learn how to perform certain tasks by generalizing examples from a range of sampling. This is a totally different paradigm than traditional programming language approaches, which are based on writing programs that process data to produce an output. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a particular application requires a substantial amount of time and effort that is hard to undertake even with excellent research papers and textbooks. In order to reduce the time and effort, this paper introduces the TCDC (train, compare, decide, and change) approach, which can be thought as a ‘Machine Learning as a Service’ approach, to aid machine learning researchers and practitioners to choose the optimum machine learning model to use for achieving the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, computational complexity, and ease of implementation. The paper includes the results of testing and evaluating the recommenders based on the TCDC approach (in comparison with the traditional default approach) applied to 12 datasets that are available as open-source datasets drawn from diverse domains including health care, agriculture, aerodynamics and others. Our results indicate that the proposed approach selects the best model in terms of predictive accuracy in 62.5 % for regression tests performed and 75 % for classification tests.",

abstract = "<p>The study of systems and architectures for ambient assisted living (AAL) is undoubtedly a topic of great relevance given the aging of the world population. The AAL technologies are designed to meet the needs of the aging population in order to maintain their independence as long as possible. As people typically spend more than 90% of their time in indoor environments, indoor air quality (iAQ) is perceived as an imperative variable to be controlled for the inhabitants’ wellbeing and comfort. Advances in networking, sensors, and embedded devices have made it possible to monitor and provide assistance to people in their homes. The continuous technological advancements make it possible to build smart objects with great capabilities for sensing and connecting several possible advancements in ambient assisted living systems architectures. Indoor environments are characterized by several pollutant sources. Most of the monitoring frameworks instantly accessible are exceptionally costly and only permit the gathering of arbitrary examples. iAQ is an indoor air quality system based on an Internet of Things paradigm that incorporates in its construction Arduino, ESP8266, and XBee technologies for processing and data transmission and micro sensors for data acquisition. It also allows access to data collected through web access and through a mobile application in real time, and this data can be accessed by doctors in order to support medical diagnostics. Five smaller scale sensors of natural parameters (air temperature, moistness, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and glow) were utilized. Different sensors can be included to check for particular contamination. The results reveal that the system can give a viable indoor air quality appraisal in order to anticipate technical interventions for improving indoor air quality. Indeed indoor air quality might be distinctively contrasted with what is normal for a quality living environment.</p>",

A body sensor network (BSN) is a type of network for Internet of Things. A BSN typically consists of tens (dozens) of biosensor nodes distributed on/in the human body, and these autonomous nodes can form a wireless network to measure physiological signals and execute intelligent treatment automatically. BSNs have wide application prospects in intelligent healthcare. Because physiological signals measured and processed by BSNs involve patient privacy, security mechanisms must be developed to secure BSNs, and therefore the adoption of available key negotiation protocols is fundamental. Due to stringently limited operation resources, BSNs require these protocols to be highly energy efficient. Recent development has discovered that certain physiological signals can be used for efficiently negotiating common keys among biosensor nodes. These signals and fuzzy technology are used to design lightweight key negotiation protocols, and many solutions have been proposed.

Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a significant transformation in the quality of healthcare services provided by healthcare organizations and professionals. Recent advances have led to the emergence of Electronic Health (E-health), largely made possible by the massive deployment and adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, cybercriminals and attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities associated primarily with ICTs, causing data breaches of patients’ confidential digital health information records. Here, we review recent security attacks reported for E-healthcare and discuss the solutions proposed to mitigate them.

Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as a revolutionary technology in many application domains in health-care, fitness, smart cities, and many other compelling Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Most commercially available systems assume that a single device monitors a plethora of user information. In reality, BSN technology is transitioning to multi-device synchronous measurement environments; fusion of the data from multiple, potentially heterogeneous, sensor sources is therefore becoming a fundamental yet non-trivial task that directly impacts application performance. Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision).

At the same time, software paradigms such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Web of Things (WoT) are motivating the creation of technology to support the development and deployment of web-enabled embedded sensor and actuator devices with two major objectives: (i) to integrate sensing and actuating functionalities into everyday objects, and (ii) to easily allow a diversity of devices to plug into the Internet. Currently, developers who are applying this Internet-oriented approach need to have solid understanding about specific platforms and web technologies. In order to alleviate this development process, this research proposes a Resource-Oriented and Ontology-Driven Development (ROOD) methodology based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA).

The aim of this study is to propose a cloud-based system to prevent and control the spread of Zika virus disease using integration of mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT). Methods: A Naive Bayesian Network (NBN) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users, and Google Maps Web service is used to provide the geographic positioning system (GPS)-based risk assessment to prevent the outbreak. It is used to represent each ZikaV infected user, mosquito-dense sites, and breeding sites on the Google map that helps the government healthcare authorities to control such risk-prone areas effectively and efficiently. Results: The performance and accuracy of the proposed system are evaluated using dataset for 2 million users. Our system provides high accuracy for initial diagnosis of different users according to their symptoms and appropriate GPS-based risk assessment.

A novel conceptual framework is presented for a new generation of IoT devices that will enable multiple new features for both the IoT administrators as well as end users. Exploiting the recent emergence of software-defined architecture, these smart IoT devices will allow fast, reliable, and intelligent management of diverse IoT-based applications.

Existing method on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) presented sensed data communication through continuous data collection resulting in higher delay and energy consumption. To conquer the routing issue and reduce energy drain rate, Bayes Node Energy and Polynomial Distribution (BNEPD) technique is introduced with energy aware routing in the wireless sensor network. The Bayes Node Energy Distribution initially distributes the sensor nodes that detect an object of similar event (i.e., temperature, pressure, flow) into specific regions with the application of Bayes rule. The object detection of similar events is accomplished based on the bayes probabilities and is sent to the sink node resulting in minimizing the energy consumption. Next, the Polynomial Regression Function is applied to the target object of similar events considered for different sensors are combined. They are based on the minimum and maximum value of object events and are transferred to the sink node. Finally, the Poly Distribute algorithm effectively distributes the sensor nodes. The energy efficient routing path for each sensor nodes are created by data aggregation at the sink based on polynomial regression function which reduces the energy drain rate with minimum communication overhead. Experimental performance is evaluated using Dodgers Loop Sensor Data Set from UCI repository. Simulation results show that the proposed distribution algorithm significantly reduce the node energy drain rate and ensure fairness among different users reducing the communication overhead.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving e-health system, which is a fusion of Internet-of-things (IoT), big data and cloud storage. The medical IoT network monitors patient’s physiological data, which are aggregated to electronic health record (EHR). The medical big data that contains a large amount of EHRs are outsourced to cloud platform. In the proposed system, the patient distributes an IoT group key to the medical nodes in an authenticated way without interaction round. The IoT messages are encrypted using the IoT group key and transmitted to the patient, which can be batch authenticated by the patient. The encrypted EHRs are shared among patient and different data users in a fine-grained access control manner. A novel keyword match based policy update mechanism is designed to enable flexible access policy updating without privacy leakage. Extensive comparison and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms in the proposed system are efficient. Comprehensive analysis is provided to prove its security. •Anonymity and traceability of patient and medical node: In this system, anonymous identities are assigned for both patient and medical nodes, which is calculated from their real identities. If an anonymous patient is found dishonest or misbehaving, the trusted authority is capable to trace his real identity. If an anonymous medical node is compromised and utilized to launch attack in patient’s IoT network, the patient can also recover the node’s real identity.•Authenticated IoT key distribution: In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the messages transmitted in the health IoT network, the patient generates a symmetric key and sends it to all the medical nodes (in patient’s IoT network) in a privacy-preserving way. A key extraction auxiliary message is created by the patient to encapsulate the IoT key. Receiving the message, the medical nodes authenticate that whether the auxiliary message is indeed sent by the patient to prevent impersonation attack.•Authenticated IoT ciphertext transmission: After the IoT key is extracted by the medical nodes, the generated IoT messages are encrypted by the key and sends to the patient. To ensure the reliability of the source, the patient authenticates the IoT ciphertext and then decrypt it. A large amount of IoT ciphertexts may arrive at the same time period, our system also provides a batch verification algorithm to improve the efficiency.•Lightweight fine-grained access control: The e-health big data are encrypted and stored in a cloud platform. To prevent unauthorized data access, our system designs an expressive and lightweight fine-grained access control mechanism. The patient controls the electronic health record (EHR) encryption procedure, and defines an access policy such that the data users with specific attributes can decrypt patient’s medical files. The algorithms in the access control mechanism are lightweight constructions.•Flexible subset keyword match based access policy update: We design a novel access policy update mechanism based on keyword match. When the patient wants to change the access policy, he does not need to download all his EHR ciphertexts, decrypt them and re-encrypt them with a new access policy. In our system, the patient generates a privacy-preserving policy update query, which is sent to the cloud server. Then, the cloud server updates the match files without knowing the plaintext. A highlight is that the policy update process is keyword match based. If the patient wants to update the access policy of the EHRs that contains certain keywords, the query keywords are embedded in the policy update query. Only the access policy match files that contains these query keywords as subset keywords will be updated.",

VC firm Rock Health’s midyear review of digital health funding indicates significant funding for categories such as wearables and sensors, population health management, and personal health tools which are classified as “consumerization” apps, though in reality in all of these categories analytics is integrated into the offerings.

Because it is ubiquitous and perceived as free uncapped data connectivity (compared to cellular data), it seems everyone and everything has come to rely on it for connectivity to applications of every type. There is a downside to that popularity: because so much is dependent on WiFi for connectivity, wireless networks and their access points within industrial, commercial, and healthcare facilities are increasingly stretched too thin as they struggle to support so many devices and users asking so much of the network. Ironically, the very things that make WiFi such a popular platform for consumer and enterprise connectivity are affecting its performance and usefulness to serve in such a critical role. Another important consideration for product designers is how the new WiFi standard and Bluetooth complement one another. Given the ubiquity of both WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, engineers should consider a WiFi + Bluetooth option in order to give users both types of connectivity.",

abstract = "Advancements in smart devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and communication paradigm have enabled the vision of smart cities, pervasive healthcare, augmented reality and interactive multimedia, Internet of Every Thing (IoE), and cognitive assistance, to name a few. All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",

To serve the newly untethered healthcare consumer, healthcare services firms, technology vendors and a handful of nontraditional players are coming together to develop unique value-added offerings by combining data pools.

Although, there is a close relationship among the discovery, selection and composition tasks of Web services, research community has treated these challenges at individual level rather to focus on them collectively for developing efficient solution, which is the purpose of this work. This paper aims to propose an approach to integrate the service discovery, selection and composition of Semantic Web services on runtime basis. Design/methodology/approach The proposed approach defined as a quality of service (QoS)-aware approach is based on QoS model to perform discovery, selection and composition tasks at runtime to enhance the user satisfaction and quality guarantee by incorporating non-functional parameters such as response time and throughput with the Web services and user request. In this paper, the proposed approach is based on ontology for semantic description of Web services, which provides interoperability and automation in the Web services tasks. Findings This work proposed an integrated framework of Web service discovery, selection and composition which supports end user to search, select and compose the Web services at runtime using semantic description and non-functional requirements. The proposed approach is evaluated by various data sets from the Web Service Challenge 2009 (WSC-2009) to show the efficiency of this work.

Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject&#x2019;s body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.",

Further, depending on opposition-based learning theory and the new modified algorithms, an improved S -type grouping method is proposed and the original way of roulette wheel selection is substituted through sensitivity-pheromone way. Then, an adaptive step with exponential functions is designed for replacing the original random step. Finally, based on the new test function versions CEC13, six benchmark functions with the dimensions D = 20 and D = 40 are chosen and applied in the experiments for analyzing and comparing the iteration speed and accuracy of the new modified algorithms. The experimental results show that the new modified algorithm has faster and more stable searching and can quickly increase poor population diversity and bring out the global optimal solutions.",

A passive contactless sensor is presented for monitoring resistivity in porous materials. Electrical resistivity (ER) is an important indicator of water and ion content in porous materials, especially man-made and natural composites such as concrete and soil. The ER sensor is small, battery-free and is energised and queried wirelessly for data by a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader or a near-field communication (NFC) enabled mobile device (a tablet or Smartphone). By applying Topsøe coefficients and a calibration function to the sensor output, the ER of the material is reliably estimated. Experimental results in the laboratory with a model aggregate material (sand) wetted with sodium chloride solutions demonstrate excellent agreement between the new sensor and a standard laboratory conductivity meter. Embedded ER sensors can provide long-term and repeatable data from soil, concrete and similar porous materials where ER is an accepted proxy for water and ion content.

Despite the promising applicability of the IoT, developing an IoT service is challenging for programmers, because the programmers should integrate multiple programmable devices and heterogeneous third-party devices. Recent works have proposed integrated programming platforms, but they either require device-specific implementation for third-party devices without any device abstraction, or abstract all the devices to the standard interfaces requiring unnecessary abstraction of programmable devices. To integrate IoT devices with selective abstraction, this work revisits the object oriented programming (OOP) model, and proposes a new language extension and its compiler-runtime framework, called Esperanto. With three annotations that map each object to its corresponding IoT device, the Esperanto language allows programmers to integrate multiple programmable devices into one OOP program and to abstract similar third-party devices into their common ancestor classes. Given the annotations, the Esperanto compiler automatically partitions the integrated program into multiple sub-programs for each programmable IoT device, and inserts communication and synchronization code. Moreover, for the ancestor classes, the Esperanto runtime dynamically identifies connected third-party devices, and links their corresponding descendent objects. Compared to an existing approach on the integrated IoT programming, Esperanto requires 33.3% fewer lines of code to implement 5 IoT services, and reduces their response time by 44.8% on average. </p></p>",

abstract = "Recent years have seen the emergence of physical products that are digitally networked with other products and with information systems to enable complex business scenarios in manufacturing, mobility, or healthcare. These “smart products”, which enable the co-creation of “smart service” that is based on monitoring, optimization, remote control, and autonomous adaptation of products, profoundly transform service systems into what we call “smart service systems”. In a multi-method study that includes conceptual research and qualitative data from in-depth interviews, we conceptualize “smart service” and “smart service systems” based on using smart products as boundary objects that integrate service consumers’ and service providers’ resources and activities. Smart products allow both actors to retrieve and to analyze aggregated field evidence and to adapt service systems based on contextual data. We discuss the implications that the introduction of smart service systems have for foundational concepts of service science and conclude that smart service systems are characterized by technology-mediated, continuous, and routinized interactions.",

In 1945, when he was head of the power tube division at Raytheon, Spencer became the first to investigate why a candy bar had melted in his pocket while he was testing a magnetron tube. Before long, Raytheon had a patent on the first microwave, the Radarange, which weighed 750 pounds and sold as a commercial cooker for $2,000 to $3,000 to restaurants, ocean liners and passenger trains as a way to conveniently provide warm meals. According to Ryan McKillen, software engineer at Uber, they had to write lots of JavaScript and Python and build their dispatch systems on Node.js and Redis. Information Technology and Innovation Foundation President Robert D. Atkinson says that his organization has seen dramatic progress in scientific and technological innovation since their organization was founded in 2006.

Less attention has been given to the production of sensor platforms in the μ W range for ultra-low power applications. Here, we discuss how to scale the nanosensor energy demand by developing a process for integration of nanowire sensing arrays on a monolithic CMOS chip. This work demonstrates an off-chip nanowire fabrication method; subsequently nanowires link to a fused SiO 2 substrate using electric-field assisted directed assembly. The nanowire resistances shown in this work have the highest resistance uniformity reported to date of 18%, which enables a practical roadmap towards the coupling of nanosensors to CMOS circuits and signal processing systems. The article also presents the utility of optimizing annealing conditions of the off-chip metal-oxides prior to CMOS integration to avoid limitations of thermal budget and process incompatibility. In the context of the platform demonstrated here, directed assembly is a powerful tool that can realize highly uniform, cross-reactive arrays of different types of metal-oxide nanosensors suited for gas discrimination and signal processing systems.",

Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.",

However, several challenging issues need to be addressed before this vision of applications based on IoT concepts becomes a reality. Because many IoT applications will be distributed over a large number of interacting devices, centralized control will not be possible and so open problems will need to be solved that relate to building locally operating self-organizing and self-adaptive systems. As an initial step in creating IoT applications with these features, this paper presents a Framework for IoT (FIoT). The approach is based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Machine Learning Techniques, such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. To illustrate the use of FIoT, the paper contains two different IoT applications: (i) Quantified Things and (ii) Smart traffic control. We show how flexible points of our framework are instantiated to generate these IoT application.",

In health care in particular, sensors and data links offer potential for constant monitoring of patient's symptoms and needs, in real time, enabling physicians to diagnose and monitor health problems wherever the patient is, either at home or outdoors. However, the use of Internet of Things concepts in the health domain does not come without extra data and therefore a data transfer cost overheads. To deal with these overheads, novel metrics, and methods are introduced in an attempt to maximize the capabilities and widen acceptance/usage provided by the Internet of Things. Without losing its generality, the method discussed is experimentally evaluated in the paradigm of the Health domain. The focus is on the need for an overview of available data formats and transmission methods and selection of the optimal combination, which can result to reduction/minimization of costs. An analytic methodology is presented backed with theoretical metrics and evaluated experimentally.

One of these still underdeveloped applications is monitoring physical parameters on a person. This is an especially interesting application regarding their age or activity, for any detected hazardous parameter can be notified not only to the monitored person as a warning, but also to any third party that may be helpful under critical circumstances, such as relatives or healthcare centers. We propose a system built to monitor a sportsman/woman during a workout session or performing a sport-related indoor activity. Sensors have been deployed by means of several nodes acting as the nodes of a WSN, along with a semantic middleware development used for hardware complexity abstraction purposes.

In this paper, a framework for IoT based patient monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is presented to enhance the deliverance of curative services. Though ICUs remained a center of attraction for high quality care among researchers, still number of studies have depicted the vulnerability to a patient’s life during ICU stay. The work presented in this study addresses such concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of various events (and anomalies) with temporal associations, followed by time sensitive alert generation procedure. In order to validate the system, it was deployed in 3 ICU room facilities for 30 days in which nearly 81 patients were monitored during their ICU stay. The results obtained after implementation depicts that IoT equipped ICUs are more efficient in monitoring sensitive events as compared to manual monitoring and traditional Tele-ICU monitoring.

Currently, most WSNs are powered by batteries, which must be replaced frequently, increasing maintenance costs and operational complexity. In this paper, we propose a practical framework, called wirelessly energy-charged (WINCH), for battery maintenance; it involves recharging sensor batteries using mobile robots. This framework integrates a routing process in which the cluster heads are selected optimally, as in the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy&#x2013;centralized protocol (LEACH-C), and the robots visit the sites frequently based on need and place themselves in the optimal positions with respect to the selected cluster heads. This approach considerably reduces overhead compared with existing methods. Moreover, we have developed an empirical model of the energy charging rate for sensor nodes. We use this model to compute the amount of energy harvested by each sensor in the proximity of the mobile charger. Simulation experiments for a wide range of design parameters and using several metrics, such as energy consumption, network throughput, and coverage, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with an existing work.",

Currently, we have observed that a plethora of interconnected smartphones, devices, and sensors are deployed for providing personalized services (e.g., social media, smart home, health monitoring) at any time from anywhere. The personalized services offered by IoT, although enhancing the quality of our lives, have serious challenges of securing networks and data in transit, as every day a myriad of devices and services are connected to the IoT. However, existing security solutions, such as two-factor authentication based on passwords along with second-level protection may not be efficient and reliable for providing end-to-end secure communication solutions among different devices and services connected to the IoT. To this end, this article proposes an end-to-end secure IoT-based solution using biometrics and pairing-based cryptography. Because of the uniqueness of one’s biometric traits (e.g., face, fingerprint, palm, iris, voice, heartbeat), a biometric-based security solution is less vulnerable to security breaches for IoT systems or infrastructure. We present a biometric- based IoT infrastructure comprising four layers, and for each layer, we discuss possible security challenges along with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we provide a case study of face-based biometric recognition, where sensors or smartphones capture a face image and securely transmit it to the IoT platform to provide end-to end security.",

Then, we show a simple decentralized power allocation along with the equivalent single-antenna conversion. To exploit the multiuser diversity gain, an opportunistic transmission protocol is proposed, where the secondary users generating less interference are opportunistically selected, resulting in a further reduction of the interference temperature. The proposed methods are validated via computer simulations. Numerical results show that increasing the number of transmit antennas can greatly reduce the interference temperature, while increasing the number of receive antennas leads to a reduction of the total transmit power. Optimal parameter values of the opportunistic transmission protocol are examined according to three types of beamforming and different antenna configurations, in terms of maximizing the cognitive transmission capacity. All the beamforming, decentralized power allocation, and opportunistic transmission protocol are performed by the secondary users in a decentralized manner, thus resulting in an easy implementation in practice.",

abstract = "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge of the transformative potential of big data on city-based transport models. The central question guiding this paper is: how could big data transform smart city transport operations? In answering this question the authors present initial results from a Markov study. However the authors also suggest caution in the transformation potential of big data and highlight the risks of city and organizational adoption. A theoretical framework is presented together with an associated scenario which guides the development of a Markov model.Design/methodology/approachA model with several scenarios is developed to explore a theoretical framework focussed on matching the transport demands (of people and freight mobility) with city transport service provision using big data. This model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services.FindingsThis modelling study is an initial preliminary stage of the investigation in how big data could be used to redefine and enable new operational models. The study provides new understanding about load sharing and optimization in a smart city context. Basically the authors demonstrate how big data could be used to improve transport efficiency and lower externalities in a smart city. Further how improvement could take place by having a car free city environment, autonomous vehicles and shared resource capacity among providers.Research limitations/implicationsThe research relied on a Markov model and the numerical solution of its steady state probabilities vector to illustrate the transformation of transport operations management (OM) in the future city context. More in depth analysis and more discrete modelling are clearly needed to assist in the implementation of big data initiatives and facilitate new innovations in OM. The work complements and extends that of Setia and Patel (2013), who theoretically link together information system design to operation absorptive capacity capabilities.Practical implicationsThe study implies that transport operations would actually need to be re-organized so as to deal with lowering CO2footprint. The logistic aspects could be seen as a move from individual firms optimizing their own transportation supply to a shared collaborative load and resourced system. Such ideas are radical changes driven by, or leading to more decentralized rather than having centralized transport solutions (Caplice, 2013).Social implicationsThe growth of cities and urban areas in the twenty-first century has put more pressure on resources and conditions of urban life. This paper is an initial first step in building theory, knowledge and critical understanding of the social implications being posed by the growth in cities and the role that big data and smart cities could play in developing a resilient and sustainable transport city system.Originality/valueDespite the importance of OM to big data implementation, for both practitioners and researchers, we have yet to see a systematic analysis of its implementation and its absorptive capacity contribution to building capabilities, at either city system or organizational levels. As such the Markov model makes a preliminary contribution to the literature integrating big data capabilities with OM capabilities and the resulting improvements in system absorptive capacity.",

PyEHR adopts the openEHR’s formalisms to guarantee the decoupling of data descriptions from implementation details and exploits structure indexing to accelerate searches. Data persistence is guaranteed by a driver layer with a common driver interface. Interfaces for two NoSQL Database Management Systems are already implemented: MongoDB and Elasticsearch. We evaluated the scalability of PyEHR experimentally through two types of tests, called “Constant Load” and “Constant Number of Records”, with queries of increasing complexity on synthetic datasets of ten million records each, containing very complex openEHR archetype structures, distributed on up to ten computing nodes.",

abstract = "Certificateless-based signcryption overcomes inherent shortcomings in traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Key Escrow problem. It imparts efficient methods to design PKIs with public verifiability and cipher text authenticity with minimum dependency. As a classic primitive in public key cryptography, signcryption performs validity of cipher text without decryption by combining authentication, confidentiality, public verifiability and cipher text authenticity much more efficiently than the traditional approach. In this paper, we first define a security model for certificateless-based signcryption called, Complex Conjugate Differential Integrated Factor (CC-DIF) scheme by introducing complex conjugates through introduction of the security parameter and improving secured message distribution rate. However, both partial private key and secret value changes with respect to time. To overcome this weakness, a new certificateless-based signcryption scheme is proposed by setting the private key through Differential (Diff) Equation using an Integration Factor (DiffEIF), minimizing computational cost and communication overhead. The scheme is therefore said to be proven secure (i.e. improving the secured message distributing rate) against certificateless access control and signcryption-based scheme. In addition, compared with the three other existing schemes, the CC-DIF scheme has the least computational cost and communication overhead for secured message communication in mobile network.",

This performance estimation study captures interference impacts on the target cloud access points from multiple interference components generated by the 60 GHz wireless transmissions from nearby surveillance camera devices to their associated cloud access points. With this uplink interference scenario, the interference impacts on the main wireless transmission from a target surveillance camera device to its associated target cloud access point with a number of settings are measured and estimated under the consideration of 60 GHz radiation characteristics and antenna radiation pattern models.",

A practice that is quickly becoming fundamental to maintenance management, it utilizes periodic assessments to analyze the health of equipment. When executed consistently, it enables an understanding of a more periodic state of the equipment -- a heartbeat of its condition, if you will -- to help inform maintenance planning.

During the WCE procedure, a significant amount of redundant video data is generated, the transmission of which to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists securely for analysis is challenging as well as wastage of several resources including energy, memory, computation, and bandwidth. In addition to this, it is inherently difficult and time consuming for gastroenterologists to analyze this huge volume of gastrointestinal video data for desired contents. To surmount these issues, we propose a secure video summarization framework for outdoor patients going through WCE procedure. In the proposed system, keyframes are extracted using a light-weighted video summarization scheme, making it more suitable for WCE. Next, a cryptosystem is presented for security of extracted keyframes based on 2D Zaslavsky chaotic map. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed cryptosystem in terms of robustness and high-level security compared to other recent image encryption schemes during dissemination of important keyframes to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists for personalized WCE.",

From a human perspective, people seek control over their lives, good health, social connection, and a sense of well-being that comes from having purpose and feeling competent in daily routines. So are technologies meant to enable users to stay in control of their lives and manage their relations and preferred routines, or do they undermine it, making elderly people feel subjects of surveillance and incompetent, disrupting their daily arrangements?

abstract = "<p>Both distributed healthcare systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are currently hot topics. The latter is a new computing paradigm to enable advanced capabilities in engineering various applications, including those for healthcare. For such systems, the core social requirement is the privacy/security of the patient information along with the technical requirements (e.g., energy consumption) and capabilities for adaptability and personalization. Typically, the functionality of the systems is predefined by the patient’s data collected using sensor networks along with medical instrumentation; then, the data is transferred through the Internet for treatment and decision-making. Therefore, systems creation is indeed challenging. In this paper, we propose a model-driven framework to develop the IoT-based prototype and its reference architecture for personalized health monitoring (PHM) applications. The framework contains a multi-layered structure with feature-based modeling and feature model transformations at the top and the application software generation at the bottom. We have validated the framework using available tools and developed an experimental PHM to test some aspects of the functionality of the reference architecture in real time. The main contribution of the paper is the development of the model-driven computational framework with emphasis on the synergistic effect of security and energy issues.</p>",

The new era of the Internet of Things (IoT) will see the fabrication of numerous small form factor devices for wireless sensing for a plurality of applications, including security, health, and environmental monitoring. The large volume of these devices will require new directions in terms of manufacturing cost and energy efficiency, which will be achieved with redesigned, energy-aware modules. This paper presents the state of the art of printed passives, sensors, energy harvesting modules, actives, and communication front ends, and summarizes the challenges of implementing modules that feature low power consumptions without compromising the low fabrication cost.

While many standards have been stipulated to control vehicular emissions, current inspection program for examining the engine health of in-use vehicles is practically ineffective and time-consuming. In particular, in-use vehicles are only required for inspection yearly, but huge amount of emissions may have been produced from malfunctioned engines daily. A new wireless inspection and notification system (WINS) is therefore proposed to monitor the vehicle engine health on the street in situ. The principle of WINS is to wirelessly examine some of the engine parameters through radio frequency identification (RFID) and traffic lights. RFID tags are installed on vehicles to collect the engine health information, whereas RFID interrogators are installed on traffic lights for wireless data transmission. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed WINS, and the results show that the proposed WINS is more convenient and economical than traditional vehicle inspection system. Moreover, as there are more than hundreds of traffic lights in the traffic network of a city, a maximum spanning tree (MAXST) algorithm is proposed to determine the suitable number of RFID devices required in the network so that the implementation cost, system loading and missing rate can be optimized. Different from the typical spanning tree algorithm in operational research, the MAXST algorithm has a domain-specific rule and weight calculation method for this application. To verify the methodology, simulations on the traffic networks of Shenzhen, New York and London were conducted. Results show that only 25–40% of traffic lights of the traffic networks are necessary for installation of RFID interrogators, with a rate of 2–7% that the vehicle owners may be able to escape the location of RFID interrogators.",

At the present time, the 2.45 GHz band is in widespread use for these applications but in this paper, the authors investigate the potential of the 915 MHz ISM band in implementing future, wearable IoT devices. The target sensor is a wrist-worn wireless heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor with the goal of providing efficient wireless functionality and long battery lifetime using a commercial Sub-GHz low-power radio transceiver. A detailed analysis of current consumption for various wireless protocols is also presented and analyzed. A novel 915 MHz antenna design of compact size is reported that has good resilience to detuning by the human body. The antenna also incorporates a matching network to meet the challenging bandwidth requirements and is fabricated using standard, low-cost FR-4 material. Full-Wave EM simulations are presented for the antenna placed in both free-space and on-body cases. A prototype antenna is demonstrated and has dimensions of 44 mm × 28 mm × 1.6 mm. The measured results at 915 MHz show a 10 dB return loss bandwidth of 55 MHz, a peak realized gain of - 2.37 dBi in free-space and - 6.1 dBi on-body.

In this context, wireless transmission plays a key role, and among available solutions, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is gaining more and more popularity. BLE merges together good performance, low-energy consumption and widespread diffusion. The aim of this work is to review the main methodologies adopted to investigate BLE performance. The first part of this review is an in-depth description of the protocol, highlighting the main characteristics and implementation details. The second part reviews the state of the art on BLE characteristics and performance. In particular, we analyze throughput, maximum number of connectable sensors, power consumption, latency and maximum reachable range, with the aim to identify what are the current limits of BLE technology. The main results can be resumed as follows: throughput may theoretically reach the limit of ~230 kbps, but actual applications analyzed in this review show throughputs limited to ~100 kbps; the maximum reachable range is strictly dependent on the radio power, and it goes up to a few tens of meters; the maximum number of nodes in the network depends on connection parameters, on the network architecture and specific device characteristics, but it is usually lower than 10; power consumption and latency are largely modeled and analyzed and are strictly dependent on a huge number of parameters. Most of these characteristics are based on analytical models, but there is a need for rigorous experimental evaluations to understand the actual limits.",

Hence, there is a need for the proactive identification and effective mitigation mechanisms for these patient’s data privacy concerns that pose continuous threats to the integrity and stability of the healthcare environment. For this purpose, a systematic literature review has been conducted that presents a clear picture of the privacy concerns of patient’s data in cloud-assisted healthcare systems and analyzed the mechanisms that are recently proposed by the research community. The methodology used for conducting the review was based on Kitchenham guidelines. Results from the review show that most of the patient’s data privacy techniques do not fully address the privacy concerns and therefore require more efforts.

Brahmachari (1,6) Keywords: Neonate health; Neonatology intensive care unit; PACS; EMR/his; Deep learning; IoT cloud Abstract: Neonatal period represents first 28 days of life, which is the most vulnerable time for a child's survival especially for the preterm babies. High neonatal mortality is a prominent and persistent problem across the globe. Non-availability of trained staff and infrastructure are the major recognized hurdles in the quality care of these neonates. Hourly progress growth charts and reports are still maintained manually by nurses along with continuous calculation of drug dosage and nutrition as per the changing weight of the baby. iNICU (integrated Neonatology Intensive Care Unit) leverages Beaglebone and Intel Edison based IoT integration with biomedical devices in NICU i.e. monitor, ventilator and blood gas machine. iNICU is hosted on IBM Softlayer based cloud computing infrastructure and map NICU workflow in Java based responsive web application to provide translational research informatics support to the clinicians. iNICU captures real time vital parameters i.e. respiration rate, heart rate, lab data and PACS amounting for millions of data points per day per child. Stream of data is sent to Apache Kafka layer which stores the same in Apache Cassandra NoSQL. iNICU also captures clinical data like feed intake, urine output, and daily assessment of child in PostgreSQL database. It acts as first Big Data hub (of both structured and unstructured data) of neonates across India offering temporal (longitudinal) data of their stay in NICU and allow clinicians in evaluating efficacy of their interventions. iNICU leverages drools based clinical rule based engine and deep learning based big data analytical model coded in R and PMML. iNICU solution aims to improve care time, fills skill gap, enable remote monitoring of neonates in rural regions, assists in identifying the early onset of disease, and reduction in neonatal mortality.

abstract = "This letter proposes a novel privacy-aware &#x201C;blind&#x201D; cloud infrastructure to be utilized for storage, processing, and organization of health data. Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.",

With the introduction in 2010 of the Qj standard, many wireless rechargeable devices appeared on the market, calling for solution of several classes of problems ranging from EMC, health compliance, and power efficiency, representing a stimulating field of activity for scientists and researchers. Beside this leading application area, great interest is being received by two other application categories: Electric Vehicles (EV) and long range electromagnetic transmission of energy. The first is about to approach the market as testified by recent demonstration activities carried on by leading car makers (mostly from Japan). The second is mostly driven by the Internet of Things (loT) perspective evolution that requires energizing plenty of contactless devices, often non-precisely referred in space. It is clear, even from this very synthetic description of the WPT scenario, how WPT actually is an inclusive, multidiscipline field of different but dependent researches.

In this paper, Knowle—an online news management system upon semantic link network model is introduced. Knowle is a news event centrality data management system. The core elements of Knowle are news events on the Web, which are linked by their semantic relations. Knowle is a hierarchical data system, which has three different layers including the bottom layer (concepts), the middle layer (resources), and the top layer (events). The basic blocks of the Knowle system—news collection, resources representation, semantic relations mining, semantic linking news events are given. Knowle does not require data providers to follow semantic standards such as RDF or OWL, which is a semantics-rich self-organized network. It reflects various semantic relations of concepts, news, and events. Moreover, in the case study, Knowle is used for organizing and mining health news, which shows the potential on forming the basis of designing and developing big data analytics based innovation framework in the health domain. •Introducing the semantic link network based system—Knowle.•Using Knowle for processing health news data.•Knowle has performed from 2009 to now, which has collected about 35000 news events and 10 million Webpages.",

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in several domains such as surveillance of civil infrastructure, smart grids, and smart healthcare are of utmost importance for our society and require dependable performance. Guaranteeing that application-specific dependability requirements are met is however still an open research challenge. The IoT indeed exposes highly resource-constrained computing devices to harsh environmental conditions (e.g., heat, mechanical shock, electromagnetic radiation) and physical attacks. Unfortunately, traditional methods to withstand these threats heavily rely on redundancy, a concept that is incompatible with the resource constraints of common IoT devices. In this article, we illustrate our efforts in providing methods and tools to predict, guarantee, and raise the level of dependability of the IoT. We first outline our contributions in the area of dependable wireless networking and describe a cost-effective solution allowing to guarantee that IoT applications meet specific performance requirements despite the challenging interaction of low-power wireless networks with their surrounding environment. We then argue that dependable networking alone is insufficient to guarantee the correct operation of a complex IoT system, and outline how we join different scientific disciplines in a long-term endeavor and work towards a coherent view of dependability. Die Anwendungen des Internets der Dinge (IoT – Internet of Things), wie z. B. die Überwachung von zivilen Infrastruktureinrichtungen, Smart Grids oder intelligente Gesundheitspflege, sind für unsere Gesellschaft von größter Bedeutung und erfordern eine hohe Verlässlichkeit des IoT. Die je nach Gebiet unterschiedlichen Anforderungen an die Zuverlässigkeit zu gewährleisten, stellt jedoch immer noch eine große Herausforderung für die Wissenschaft dar. Tatsächlich sind die eingesetzten Geräte und Computer rauen Umgebungsbedingungen (wie z. B. Hitze oder elektromagnetische Strahlung) sowie physischen Angriffen ausgesetzt. Herkömmliche Methoden diesen Bedrohungen stand zu halten, beruhen meist auf Redundanzen – einem Konzept, das mit den beschränkten Ressourcen gängiger IoT-Plattformen nicht umsetzbar ist. Im vorliegenden Beitrag zeigen die Autoren Methoden und Werkzeuge auf, um die Zuverlässigkeit des IoT zu erhöhen, besser vorhersagbar zu machen und letztlich Verlässlichkeitsgarantien abzugeben. Sie berichten zunächst über Erfahrungen im Bereich der zuverlässigen drahtlosen Vernetzung und beschreiben eine effiziente Lösung, um auch in anspruchsvollen Umgebungen mit ressourcenarmen IoT-Plattformen verlässlich kommunizieren zu können. Um ein verlässliches IoT zu konstruieren, genügt die alleinige Betrachtung der drahtlosen Vernetzung jedoch nicht. Die Autoren beschreiben daher einen ganzheitlichen interdisziplinären Ansatz, um alle relevanten Aspekte des IoT verlässlich zu gestalten.",

The exploitation of the Internet protocol version 6 addressing space along with the miniaturization of electronic devices has fostered providing interoperability and connectivity of wearable sensor devices in wireless body area networks to the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose to integrate the IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) to the u‐healthcare monitoring system architecture. The main objective is to study the feasibility of the 6LoWPAN‐enabled platform in real‐world scenarios dealing with medical data. The performance evaluation of this platform is carried out initially through simulations using OMNet++ and then supported by an experimental study using sensor motes and a customized micro‐computing unit. Performance metrics such as throughput, end‐to‐end delay, packet error rate, and energy consumption are investigated under acute health conditions, where patient's health information has to be sent continuously and at maximum rate to the care provider.

Jet engines, for example, can generate terabytes of data per flight. Optimized business efficiency is likely to be the earliest benefit seen from IoT implementations. Venkat Viswanathan, founder and chairman, LatentView Analystics, said going beyond efficiency, IoT data can be used to gather insights for business advantage. There are several ways to stitch together a network of IoT-ready devices or applications, but open APIs may be the most effective route to assuring greater connectivity between enterprises and their devices.",

The Internet of Things (IoT), a recent breakthrough in communication technology, seems promising in improving health care delivery, but its potential strengths in COPD management remain poorly understood. We have developed a mobile phone-based IoT (mIoT) platform and initiated a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial entitled the 'MIOTIC study' to investigate the influence of mIoT among stable COPD patients. In the MIOTIC study, at least 600 patients with stable GOLD group C or D COPD and with a history of at least two moderate-to-severe exacerbations within the previous year will be randomly allocated to the control group, which receives routine follow-up, or the intervention group, which receives mIoT management. Endpoints of the study include (1) frequency and severity of acute exacerbation; (2) symptomatic evaluation; (3) pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) measurement; (4) exercise capacity; and (5) direct medical cost per year.

The proposed scheme can provide flexibility for various requirements of different medical services through performing AHP.

Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency, and delay that is caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for real‐time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed. The first and most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput. To this end, we need an evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a repeatable manner. In this paper we propose a simulator, called , to model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and cost. We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT environment and comparison of resource management policies.

Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model. •A new architecture is proposed to store and process scalable sensor data.•MF-R architecture uses Apache Pig and Apache HBase to the sensor data.•GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing.•MapReduce based prediction model is proposed to predict the heart diseases.",

abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world.

The purpose of this special issue is to analyze the top concerns in IoT technologies that pertain to smart sensors for health care applications; particularly applications targeted at individualized tele-health interventions with the goal of enabling healthier ways of life. These applications include wearable and body sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and the Big Data analytics required to inform these devices.",

abstract = "Tourists with chronic diseases, being afraid of unexpected emergency situation, might be less motivated to travel to remote destinations due to their health concerns, particularly while on the move. Smartphone, sensor devices, cellular communication, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recent technologies that provide new mobile location based services. Such services could help mobile tourists, i.e. tourist who is currently moving between various sites, to get innovative set of services which make their trip easier and safer. Designing efficient solutions that help tourists with chronic diseases to find an appropriate geographical route from a source to a tourism destination through a transportation network is crucial to healthcare systems. This paper proposes a new approach in generating geographical routes that are best served with close medical centers. Our approach, called Geographical Routing for Mobile Tourist (GRMT), selects a route that is best served with medical centers, and goes through the path that is as shortest as possible in regards with the distance. We have modeled and simulated the proposed approach using simulation program. Simulated experimental results show that GRMT allows tourists to select geographical routes that are served with the highest number of close medical centers although the selected route is slightly longer in distance.",

abstract = "Fatal accidents associated with underground coal mines require the implementation of high-level gas monitoring and miner’s localization approaches to promote underground safety and health. This study introduces a real-time monitoring, event-reporting and early-warning platform, based on cluster analysis for outlier detection, spatiotemporal statistical analysis, and an RSS range-based weighted centroid localization algorithm for improving safety management and preventing accidents in underground coal mines. The proposed platform seamlessly integrates monitoring, analyzing, and localization approaches using the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, a real-time operational database, application gateways, and application program interfaces. The prototype has been validated and verified at the operating underground Hassan Kishore coal mine. Sensors for air quality parameters including temperature, humidity, CH4, CO2, and CO demonstrated an excellent performance, with regression constants always greater than 0.97 for each parameter when compared to their commercial equivalent. This framework enables real-time monitoring, identification of abnormal events (>90%), and verification of a miner’s localization (with <1.8 m of error) in the harsh environment of underground mines. The main contribution of this study is the development of an open source, customizable, and cost-effective platform for effectively promoting underground coal mine safety. This system is helpful for solving the problems of accessibility, serviceability, interoperability, and flexibility associated with safety in coal mines.",

This research presents a Secure Authentication and Prescription Safety (SAPS) protocol to ensure secure communication between the patient, doctor/nurse, and the trusted server. The proposed procedure relies upon the efficient elliptic curve cryptosystem which can generate a symmetric secure key to ensure secure data exchange between patients and physicians after successful authentication of participants individually. A trusted server is involved for mutual authentication between parties and then generates a common key after completing the validation process. Moreover, the scheme is verified by doing formal modeling using Rubin Logic and validated using simulations in NS-2.35. We have analyzed the SAPS against security attacks, and then performance analysis is elucidated.

We discuss possibilities and lay out several criteria for using smart technologies for external exposome studies. Smart technologies are evolving quickly, and while they provide great promise for advancing exposure science, many are still in developmental stages and their use in epidemiology and risk studies must be carefully considered. The most useable technologies for exposure studies at this time relate to gathering exposure-factor data, such as location and activities. Development of some environmental sensors (e.g., for some air pollutants, noise, UV) is moving towards making the use of these more reliable and accessible to research studies. The possibility of accessing such an unprecedented amount of personal data also comes with various limitations and challenges, which are discussed.

Rolling bearing health analysis and remaining useful life prediction have become an increasingly crucial research area that can promote reliability and efficiency in the modern manufacturing industry. Internet-of-Things and cyber manufacturing techniques make it convenient to collect large volumes of sensor data that can provide powerful support for efficient data analytics such as deep learning. The combination of a massive amount of available data and advanced machine learning models brings new opportunities for bearing remaining useful life prediction. This paper proposes an integrated deep learning approach for multi-bearing remaining useful life collaborative prediction by combining both time domain features and frequency domain features. The method can extract high-quality degradation patterns of rolling bearing from vibration signals. Regarding features extracted from bearing vibration signals, in addition to three conventional time domain features, a novel frequency domain feature is adopted in the proposed method as well. Based on the extracted features, the deep neural network model is introduced to predict the remaining useful life of rolling bearing. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a real dataset and compare it with several commonly used shallow prediction methods Numerical experiment results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",

The reasons for such a change have been ease of timely diagnosis, convenience and comfort of clinical treatments. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are mainly characterized by deployment of biomedical sensors around human body which transmit vital signs measurements about the health status of the patient. Unfortunately, the huge traffic load of clinical data and limited resources of biomedical sensors make the efficiency of long-term operations almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to make significant advances in sensor's energy saving. Our idea is to reduce the activities of some sensors depending on the relevance between the data they measure and the diseases to detect. This paper shows how to extend the lifetime of medical WBANs by appropriately taking benefit of correlation between the knowledge about the disease and sensing data to drive the best scheduling of the medical sensors. For that, the theoretical framework of an economic approach, i.e., network utility maximization, is developed for sensor scheduling under operations cost constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and information gain is then proposed. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy saving vs latency in disease detection.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

Similarly, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is vital to overcoming mobile limited storage and computing capabilities. MCC authentication and authorization issues must be provided on two levels: login password control and the environment from where the cloud is accessed. MCC has overcome the barrier of limited storage by providing remote storage but requires a strict security system that is responsible for retrievability, integrity, and seamless storage access. Elasticity and connectivity are also of major concern in MCC because delays and jitters cause degradation in the user experience. Cloud-computing architecture creates more challenges in maintaining security because of the liberty of users to choose any MCC architecture.

Continuous physiological information monitored by wearable sensors helps doctors have a better diagnostic and a suitable treatment. When doctors want to access the patient’s sensor data remotely via network, the patient will authenticate the identity of the doctor first, and then they will negotiate a key for further communication. Many lightweight schemes have been proposed to enable a mutual authentication and key establishment between the two parties with the help of a gateway node, but most of these schemes cannot enable identity confidentiality. Besides, the shared key is also known by the gateway, which means the patient’s sensor data could be leaked to the gateway. In PriAuth, identities are encrypted to guarantee confidentiality. Additionally, Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol has been adopted to ensure the secrecy of the key, avoiding the gateway access to it. Besides, only hash and XOR computations are adopted because of the computability and power constraints of the wearable sensors. The proposed scheme has been validated by BAN logic and AVISPA, and the results show the scheme has been proven as secure.",

abstract = "In apple cultivation, simulation models may be used to monitor fruit size during the growth and development process to predict production levels and to optimize fruit quality. Here, Fuji apples cultivated in spindle-type systems were used as the model crop. Apple size was measured during the growing period at an interval of about 20 days after full bloom, with three weather stations being used to collect orchard temperature and solar radiation data at different sites. Furthermore, a 2-year dataset (2011 and 2012) of apple fruit size measurements were integrated according to the weather station deployment sites, in addition to the top two most important environment factors, thermal and sunshine hours, into the model. The apple fruit diameter and length were simulated using physiological development time (PDT), an indicator that combines important environment factors, such as temperature and photoperiod, as the driving variable. Compared to the model of calendar-based development time (CDT), an indicator counting the days that elapse after full bloom, we confirmed that the PDT model improved the estimation accuracy to within 0.2 cm for fruit diameter and 0.1 cm for fruit length in independent years using a similar data collection method in 2013. The PDT model was implemented to realize a web-based management information system for a digital orchard, and the digital system had been applied in Shandong Province, China since 2013. This system may be used to compute the dynamic curve of apple fruit size based on data obtained from a nearby weather station. This system may provide an important decision support for farmers using the website and short message service to optimize crop production and, hence, economic benefit.",

abstract = "Depth image-based rendering (DIBR), which is used to render virtual views with a color image and the corresponding depth map, is one of the key techniques in the 2D to 3D conversion process. Due to the absence of knowledge about the 3D structure of a scene and its corresponding texture, DIBR in the 2D to 3D conversion process, inevitably leads to holes in the resulting 3D image as a result of newly-exposed areas. In this paper, we proposed a structure-aided depth map preprocessing framework in the transformed domain, which is inspired by recently proposed domain transform for its low complexity and high efficiency. Firstly, our framework integrates hybrid constraints including scene structure, edge consistency and visual saliency information in the transformed domain to improve the performance of depth map preprocess in an implicit way. Then, adaptive smooth localization is cooperated and realized in the proposed framework to further reduce over-smoothness and enhance optimization in the non-hole regions. Different from the other similar methods, the proposed method can simultaneously achieve the effects of hole filling, edge correction and local smoothing for typical depth maps in a united framework. Thanks to these advantages, it can yield visually satisfactory results with less computational complexity for high quality 2D to 3D conversion. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the excellent performances of the proposed method.",

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, &#x201C;big data,&#x201D; and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.",

Time-or interval-based maintenance (TBM) accounts for almost 100%, while, On-condition maintenance and other proactive maintenance are seldom adopted. TBM not only can't prevent happens of equipment fault but also cause the waste of the maintenance resource. In order to allocate maintenance resources reasonably, ascertain the minimum preventive maintenance requirement, ensure the reliability, availability and safety, this paper carries out a research on Risk and Condition Based Maintenance (RCBM) task optimization technology. Utilizing the internet of things (IOT), real-time database, signal-processing, Gray Neural Network, probability statistical analysis and service oriented architecture (SOA) technology, a Risk and Condition Based Indicator Decision-making System (RCBIDS) is built. RCBIDS integrates RCM, condition monitoring system (CMS), key performance management module, file management module, fault and defect management module, maintenance management module together, which aims to realize remote condition monitoring, maintenance technical support services (TSS), quantitative maintenance decision-making, and to ensure the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS). The Predictive Maintenance Indicator model, reliability prediction model and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) model, which are embedded in the RCBIDS, are constructed separately. An engineering case shows that the risk and condition based maintenance task optimization technology can be used to optimize maintenance content and maintenance period, to minimize maintenance deficiencies and maintenance surplus, and to prolong the lifespan of equipment.

Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) has become a priority for every country around the world with the aim of reducing vulnerabilities and improving protection of Critical Infrastructures (CI) against terrorist attacks or natural disasters, among other threats. As part of CIP, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is defined as the process of gathering basic information that allows detecting, locating and quantifying vulnerabilities early on (fatigue cracking, degradation of boundary conditions, etc.) thereby improving, the resilience of the CI. Recent advances in electronics, wireless communication and software are expected to open the door to a new era of densely connected devices sharing information worldwide, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), in which Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role. The combined use of IoT/WSNs together with industrial sensors in SHM provide an ad-hoc, inexpensive and easy way of deploying a monitoring system, where data can be shared among different entities. SHM requirements are challenging and diverse and therefore several different technologies may be used in the same deployment. At the same time the use of a middleware can substantially simplify and speed up the development of applications for SHM. Taking into account the challenges of SHM systems, this paper provides a review of the most novel and relevant wireless technologies and a state-of-the-art middleware for WSNs focusing on SHM specific requirements.",

abstract = "In the era of Internet of things, wearable devices can be used to monitor residents’ health and upload collected health data to cloud servers for sharing, which facilitates the development of e-healthcare record (EHR) systems. However, before finding wide applications, EHR systems have to tackle privacy and efficiency challenges. For one thing, the confidentiality of EHRs is one of most important issues concerned by patients. For another, wearable devices in mobile cloud computing are often resource-constrained to some extent. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme which is proven secure in the standard model under the decisional parallel bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption. In the proposed scheme, an EHR owner can generate offline ciphertexts before knowing EHR data and access policies, which performs a majority of computation tasks. Furthermore, the online phase can rapidly assemble the final ciphertexts when EHR data and access policies become known. Our EHR access control scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes. Extensive performance comparisons and simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is very suitable for mobile cloud computing. •We propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme.•Our scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes.•Our scheme is proven secure and it is suitable for mobile cloud computing.",

abstract = "Collaborative beamforming (CBF) with a finite number of collaborating nodes (CNs) produces sidelobes that are highly dependent on the collaborating nodes’ locations. The sidelobes cause interference and affect the communication rate of unintended receivers located within the transmission range. Nulling is not possible in an open-loop CBF since the collaborating nodes are unable to receive feedback from the receivers. Hence, the overall sidelobe reduction is required to avoid interference in the directions of the unintended receivers. However, the impact of sidelobe reduction on the capacity improvement at the unintended receiver has never been reported in previous works. In this paper, the effect of peak sidelobe (PSL) reduction in CBF on the capacity of an unintended receiver is analyzed. Three meta-heuristic optimization methods are applied to perform PSL minimization, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm algorithm (PSO) and a simplified version of the PSO called the weightless swarm algorithm (WSA). An average reduction of 20 dB in PSL alongside 162% capacity improvement is achieved in the worst case scenario with the WSA optimization. It is discovered that the PSL minimization in the CBF provides capacity improvement at an unintended receiver only if the CBF cluster is small and dense.",

This paper presents a congestion and interference aware energy efficient routing technique for WSN namely, Survivable Path Routing. This protocol is supposed to work in the networks with high traffic because multiple sources try to send their packets to a destination at the same time, which is a typical scenario in IoT applications for remote healthcare monitoring. For selecting the next hop node, the algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of three factors: signal to interference and noise ratio of the link, the survivability factor the path from the next hop node to the destination, and the congestion level at the next hop node. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol works better concerning the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and the remaining energy level of the nodes. The rate of packet drops is also observed to be lesser in the congested topology scenarios.",

Prediction of symptomatic crises in chronic diseases in the IoT scenario leads to the deployment of ambulatory monitoring systems. These systems place a major concern in the amount of data to be processed and the intelligent management of the energy consumption. The huge amount of data generated for these systems require high computing capabilities only available in Data Centers. This paper presents a real case of prediction in the eHealth scenario, devoted to neurological disorders. The presented case study focuses on the migraine headache, a disease that affects around 15% of the European population. This paper extrapolates results from real data and simulations in a study where migraine patients are monitored using an unobtrusive Wireless Body Sensor Network. Low-power techniques are applied in monitorization nodes. Techniques such us: on-node signal processing and radio policies to make node’s autonomy longer and save energy, have been applied. Workload balancing policies are carried out in the coordinator nodes and Data Centers to reduce the computational burden in these facilities and minimize its energy consumption. Our results draw average savings of € 288 million in this eHealth scenario applied only to 2% of European migraine sufferers; in addition to savings of € 1272 million due to the benefits of the migraine prediction. •A real IoT eHealth scenario for and prediction of the migraine disease is shown.•Energy efficiency techniques in every level of the motorization network.•Low-power techniques in the radio and data processing in the sensing nodes.•Workload balancing policies are carried out in coordinator nodes and Data Centers.•The results show the energetic and economic benefits of the energy policies applied.",

Key distribution is required to secure e-health applications in the context of Internet of Things (IoT). However, resources constraints in IoT make these applications unable to run existing key management protocols. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight key management protocol. This protocol is based on collaboration to establish a secure end-to-end communication channel between a highly resource constrained node and a remote entity. The secure channel allows the constrained node to transmit captured data while ensuring confidentiality and authentication. To achieve this goal, we propose offloading highly consuming cryptographic primitives to third parties. As a result, the constrained node obtains assistance from powerful entities. To assess our protocol, we conduct a formal validation regarding security properties. In addition, we evaluate both communication and computational costs to highlight energy savings. The results show that our protocol provides a considerable gain in energy while its security properties are ensured.",

New types of IoT-based application services are thus presented. In a healthcare oriented environment, the usage of IoT has brought opportunities for assisting physicians (or nurses) to provide on-demand and real-time body-care services to patients with higher accuracy and better efficiency. However, while IoT-oriented techniques deliver such advantages, they may encounter system security vulnerabilities and patient privacy threats not seen in the past. In this paper, we propose a robust IoT-based healthcare system, called BSNCare+, in which body sensor networks (BSNs) are adopted as the underlying communication architecture. In the proposed healthcare system, we exploit lightweight crypto-primitives to construct a secure communication mechanism that does achieve data confidentiality and entity authentication among intelligent body sensors, the mobile gateway and the backend BSN-Care server.

Antoniou, Giorgos Bamparopoulos, Panagiotis D. Bamidis Abstract: Elderly support ambient assisted living environments are focal in healthcare computing. Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naive, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers' data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework's architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework's design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.

The data originated from multiple types of sources including mobile devices, sensors, individual archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprises, cameras, software logs, health data has led to one of the most challenging research issues of the big data era. In this paper, Knowle -- an online news management system upon semantic link network model is introduced. Knowle is a news event centrality data management system. The core elements of Knowle are news events on the Web, which are linked by their semantic relations. Knowle is a hierarchical data system, which has three different layers including the bottom layer (concepts), the middle layer (resources), and the top layer (events). The basic blocks of the Knowle system -- news collection, resources representation, semantic relations mining, semantic linking news events are given. Knowle does not require data providers to follow semantic standards such as RDF or OWL, which is a semantics-rich self-organized network. It reflects various semantic relations of concepts, news, and events. Moreover, in the case study, Knowle is used for organizing and mining health news, which shows the potential on forming the basis of designing and developing big data analytics based innovation framework in the health domain.

Medical community needs to extract precise information from that large amount of data. Currently ICT approaches do not provide a methodology for content-based medical images retrieval and classification. On the other hand, from the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, the ICT medical data can be produced by several devices. Produced data complies with all Big Data features and constraints. The IoT guidelines put at the center of the system a new smart software to manage and transform Big Data in a new understanding form. This paper describes a text based indexing system for mammographic images retrieval and classification. The system deals with text (structured reports) and images (mammograms) mining and classification in a typical Department of Radiology. DICOM structured reports, containing free text for medical diagnosis, have been analyzed and labeled in order to classify the corresponding mammographic images. Information Retrieval process is based on some text manipulation techniques, such as light semantic analysis, stop-word removing, and light medical natural language processing. The system includes also a Search Engine module, based on a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of Specificity and Sensibility. Two more indexes have been computed in order to assess the system robustness: the A.sub.z (Area under ROC Curve) index and the I.sub.Az (A.sub.z standard error) index. The dataset is composed of healthy and pathological DICOM structured reports. Two use case scenarios are presented and described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

abstract = "Since the nodes are battery operated and replenishment of battery is almost impossible especially when the nodes deployed at far distant and unattended areas. The extensive devices connected through Internet of Things (IoT) bring forth many challenges such as high battery power consumption, designing of smart e-health devices, construction of smart home control system, etc. However, among these challenges, network lifetime in the case of IoT embedded devices communications, battery lifetime of IoT devices, and deployment of sensor networks are the most prominent challenges exist in the current literature. Therefore, to extend the network lifetime and minimum utilization of battery, all the steps from node deployment to network architecture (in our case, we are considering clustered network architecture) and from sensing the environment to sharing the sensed data to the BS (i.e. routing) should be designed in a careful way. Decreasing the broadcasting of packets, and lessening the computation at the node level and minimizing the packet overhead play their important role in the conservation of energy that pushes toward better network throughput. In our under-discussed research work, we are in an aim to increase the network throughput by conserving the energy, especially during the routing process. Our work targets the constituent phases of cluster based aware energy routing for maximizing the throughput by decreasing the end-to-end delay, less packet drop ratio and improving network lifetime. Our strategies of customized, proactive routing, localized behavior strategies and in-network processing help in achieving our goal. •Energy aware routing architecture for IoT paradigm is proposed.•Enhanced the working of node deployment and sensing of data.•Efficient transfer of data through proposed routing.•The system is evaluated by comparing it to various routing protocols.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel disease-specific feature selection method which consists of a one-versus-one (OvO) features ranking stage and a feature search stage wrapped in the same OvO-rule support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier. The proposed method differs from traditional approaches in that it focuses on the selection of effective feature subsets for distinguishing a class from others by making OvO comparison. The electrocardiograms (ECG) from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH-AR) are used to evaluate the proposed feature selection method. The ECG features adopted include inter-beat and intra-beat intervals, amplitude morphology, area morphology and morphological distance. Following the recommendation of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), all the heartbeat samples of MIT-BIH-AR are grouped into four classes, namely, normal or bundle branch block (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). The division of training and testing data complies with the inter-patient schema. Experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed feature selection method is 86.66%, outperforming those methods without feature selection. The sensitivities for the classes N, S, V and F are 88.94%, 79.06%, 85.48% and 93.81% respectively, and the corresponding positive predictive values are 98.98%, 35.98%, 92.75% and 13.74% respectively. In terms of geometric means of sensitivity and positive predictivity, the proposed method also demonstrates better performance than other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

Medical devices, in the case of malfunction, can have tangible impact on patient safety. Their security, in a world where the Internet of Things has become a reality, is paramount to the continued safety of patients that are dependent upon these devices. The international standard ISO/IEC 80001 – Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices presents a unified and amalgamated approach to the safety of medical devices connected to IT networks. Whilst this standard presents a guide for security and risk management in health delivery organisations, its effectiveness with regard to contemporary cybersecurity is unknown.This research employed a structured review process to compare and analyse the ISO/IEC 80001 technical controls standards (ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 and ISO/IEC 80001-2-8), with contemporary cybersecurity best practice, guidelines and standards. The research deconstructed the technical controls and drew links between these standards and cybersecurity best practice to assess the level of harmonisation. Subsequently, a deeper analysis identified the areas of omission, coverage, addition or improvement that may impact the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 80001 to provide effective cybersecurity protection.ISO/IEC 80001 aims to provide a minimal level of cybersecurity however this research demonstrates that there are deficiencies in the standard and identifies the important aspects of cybersecurity that could be improved. This situation has arisen due to the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment and the protracted time to revise and republish international standards. This research identified several areas that require urgent consideration, including Emergency Access, Health Data De-Identification, Physical Locks on Devices, Data Backup, Disaster Recovery, Third-Party Components in Product Lifecycle Roadmap, Transmission Confidentiality, and Transmission Integrity. The research will provide health delivery organisations implementing ISO/IEC 80001, assurance as to the level of protection supplied by the ISO/IEC 80001 standard, and the areas that may need enhancement to increase cybersecurity protection and consequently increase in patient safety. Further, the outcomes are expected to influence development of the related international standard, as the findings from this research are being provided to the International Organisations for Standardisation, TC215 Health Informatics, Joint Working Group 7, to inform the review of ISO/IEC 80001 currently in progress.",

This paper presents a modular and extensible quadrotor architecture and its specific prototyping for automatic tracking applications. The architecture is extensible and based on off-the-shelf components for easy system prototyping. A target tracking and acquisition application is presented in detail to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the proposed design. Complete design details of the platform are also presented. The designed module implements the basic proportional&#x2013;integral&#x2013;derivative control and a custom target acquisition algorithm. Details of the sliding-window-based algorithm are also presented. This algorithm performs $20\times $ faster than comparable approaches in OpenCV with equal accuracy. Additional modules can be integrated for more complex applications, such as search-and-rescue, automatic object tracking, and traffic congestion analysis. A hardware architecture for the newly introduced Better Portable Graphics (BPG) compression algorithm is also introduced in the framework of the extensible quadrotor architecture. Since its introduction in 1987, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) graphics format has been the de facto choice for image compression. However, the new compression technique BPG outperforms the JPEG in terms of compression quality and size of the compressed file. The objective is to present a hardware architecture for enhanced real-time compression of the image. Finally, a prototyping platform of a hardware architecture for a secure digital camera (SDC) integrated with the secure BPG (SBPG) compression algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture is suitable for high-performance imaging in the IoT and is prototyped in Simulink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever proposed hardware architecture for SBPG compression integrated with an SDC.",

Efficient and effective management of stable COPD is essential to improve quality of life and reduce medical expenditure. The Internet of Things (IoT), a recent breakthrough in communication technology, seems promising in improving health care delivery, but its potential strengths in COPD management remain poorly understood. We have developed a mobile phone-based IoT (mIoT) platform and initiated a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial entitled the 'MIOTIC study' to investigate the influence of mIoT among stable COPD patients. In the MIOTIC study, at least 600 patients with stable GOLD group C or D COPD and with a history of at least two moderate-to-severe exacerbations within the previous year will be randomly allocated to the control group, which receives routine follow-up, or the intervention group, which receives mIoT management. Endpoints of the study include (1) frequency and severity of acute exacerbation; (2) symptomatic evaluation; (3) pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) measurement; (4) exercise capacity; and (5) direct medical cost per year.

In order to be able to propose solutions to improve the online shopping experience, we also investigated aspects influencing non-purchasing in an online environment. Methods: An online questionnaire on shopping experience, influences on the purchase, and the process of online apparel shopping using advanced technology was prepared and distributed via several online channels to the consumers who purchase apparel online. The questionnaire was completed by 76 respondents from different European countries, the United States and Australia. In order to analyze individual aspects influencing non-purchasing in an online environment, an exploratory factor analysis was performed. Results: The factor analysis revealed that the two broad dimensions of reasons why consumers have never bought any ready-to-wear apparel online despite browsing are a misperception of product integrity and time-consuming searching. The results show that the proposed solutions to improve the online apparel experience, such as making custom apparel using advanced technologies, have a positive impact on the decision of the consumers to purchase on the online apparel market. It turned out that a high proportion of potential consumers are willing to share their body dimensions through 3D body scanning technology in order to improve the fit of the apparel. Conclusion: According to the results, we expect that the advanced 3D body scanning technology would provide substantial progress regarding fit, visualization, and manufacturing of custom-made apparel when purchasing in online stores.",

However, today&#x2019;s radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with $M$ cognitive users and $N$ arms ( $M<N$ ). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into $M$ groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.",

abstract = "There are several billion network-oriented devices in use today that are facilitated to inter-communicate; thereby forming a giant neural-like architecture known as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The benefits of the IoT cut across all spectrums of our individual lives, corporate culture, and societal co-existence. This is because IoT devices support health tracking, security monitoring, consumer tracking, forecasting, and so on. However, the huge interconnectedness in IoT architectures complicates traceability and faulty data propagation is not easily detected since there are challenges with data origin authentication. Thus, this research proposes a provenance technique to deal with these issues. The technique is based on associative rules and lexical chaining methodologies, which enable traceability through the identification of propagation routes of data and object-to-object communications. Through visualization tools, the proposed methodologies also enabled us to determine linkability and unlinkability between IoT devices in a network which further leads to mechanisms to check correctness in sensor data propagation.",

The availability of low-cost IoT devices has also played a key role in furthering IoT research, development, and deployment. IoT operating systems (OSs) provide integration of software and hardware components. The availability of standard protocols, heterogeneous hardware support, ease of development, and simulation or emulation support are desirable features of IoT OSs. Contiki OS is one of the contenders for future IoT OSs. It was proposed in 2003, and since then, it has been continually under development and upgraded by professionals, academia, and researchers. Contiki OS supports open source, Internet standards, power awareness, dynamic module loading, and many hardware platforms. The diverse applications of IoT, including smart homes, smart health, smart cities, require efficient network connectivity and demand intelligent routing protocols that can handle heterogeneous, mobile, and diverse networks. Subsequently, designing routing protocols for memory- and central processing unit (CPU)-constrained IoT devices is a very challenging task. Therefore, this paper surveys the state-of-the-art routing protocols of Contiki OS. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to classify the Contiki OS routing protocol literature and list the potential challenges and future work. •Provides an overview of the Contiki OS file structure and briefly explains Contiki OS network stack (netstack).•Classifies the Contiki routing protocol research.•Summarizes the literature according to the categorization.•Lists the potential future work.•Provides open research issues and directions.",

In this paper, we have proposed a two-stage fundamental approach to facilitate the implementation of such a system. In the first stage, sensors promptly gather together the particle measurements of an android application. Then, in the second stage, the collected data are sent over a Femto-LTE network following a new scheduling technique. The proposed scheduling strategy is used to send the data according to the application's priority. The efficiency of the proposed technique is demonstrated by comparing it with that of well-known algorithms, namely, proportional fairness and exponential proportional fairness.</p>",

Moreover, we introduce a scenario of smart city to identify the technological aspect in the IoT, and discuss the key enabling technologies, including resource management, energy management, data management, session management, security and privacy, loop control, space-time consistency, nanotechnology, and quantum technology.

Model-based methods such as stochastic search require a known type of load and relatively long computational time, which limits the practical use of AS in civil engineering. Moreover, additive errors may be produced because of the discrepancy between analytic models and real structures. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a compound system called WAS, which combines AS with a wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN). A bio-inspired control framework imitating the activity of the nervous systems of animals is proposed for WAS. A typical example is tested for verification. In the example, a triangular tensegrity prism that aims to maintain its original height is integrated with a WSAN that consists of a central controller, three actuators, and three sensors. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed concept and control framework in cases of unknown loads that include different types, distributions, magnitudes, and directions. The proposed control framework can also act as a supplementary means to improve the efficiency and accuracy of control frameworks based on a common stochastic search.",

Hasta el momento, el enfoque de la literatura se ha dado en economias avanzadas. Este documento busca describir y comparar las siguientes variables: gasto domestico en ciencia y tecnologia, PIB per capita, salario minimo nominal, gasto domestico en educacion en siete economias latinoamericanas y su impacto en la tasa de desempleo durante el periodo 1996 a 2011. Se usaron datos panel para medir la relacion de las variables con las tasas de desempleo en la region. Los resultados nos permitieron concluir que la inversion en ciencia y tecnologia en la region no ha alcanzado niveles que reduzcan potencialmente el empleo; por el contrario, la innovacion es vista como una fuente de ganancias en productividad en la mano de obra. Las implicaciones mas amplias de la tecnologia y la automatizacion todavia no son evidentes, sin embargo, tanto las firmas como el sector publico en la region deben prepararse para el desempleo tecnologico masivo que se ha estimado en modelos recientes.

ABSTRACT Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, control systems, software and related technologies have revived the debate on the influence that technology has on labor markets. So far, the focus of the literature has been on advanced economies. This document aims to analyze the following variables: domestic spending in science and technology, GDP per capita, nominal minimum wage, domestic spending in education and their impact on unemployment rate in seven Latin American countries from 1996 to 2011. Panel data was used to measure the relation of these variables with unemployment rates in the region. The results allowed us to conclude that investment in Science and Technology in the region has not reached levels that potentially reduce employment; on the contrary, innovation is regarded as a source of labor productivity gains. The broader implications of technology and automation are yet to be seen, however, both firms and the public sector in the region must prepare for massive technological unemployement, as predicted by recent models.

These studies were categorized according to their similarities and differences in hope of shedding some insight into future research. There are three categories: context management, fault detection, and uncertainty handling. These three categories of work address the three most difficult problems of pervasive computing systems. First, pervasive computing systems’ perceived environments, which are also called their contexts, can vary intensively, and thus have a great impact on the systems’ dependability. Second, it is challenging to guarantee the correctness of the systems’ internal computations integrated with interactions with external environments for developers. Fault detection is then an important issue for improving dependability for these systems. Last but not least importantly, pervasive computing systems interact with their environments frequently. These interactions can be affected by many uncertainties, which can jeopardize the systems’ dependability.

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

Therefore, it is expected that IoT will play a significant role in the next-generation healthcare provisioning. Although IoT-based patient health status monitoring has become very popular, monitoring patients remotely outside of hospital settings requires augmenting the capabilities of IoT with other resources for health data storage and processing. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based service-oriented framework for continuous patient health status monitoring framework that connects WBAN through smartphones to cloud computing. We theoretically model the proposed framework, which is the first attempt in this direction, and study the behaviour of the proposed IoT–WBANs-based framework. Experimental evaluation based on the sensor lifetime, existing cost and energy consumption shows that the proposed framework substantially outperforms the baseline WBANs.",

abstract = "Among sensible goals of active and assisted living paradigm is the unobtrusive monitoring of daily living activities. Based on such monitoring, anomalies and trends can be discovered, which possibly allows for early assessment of health issues and for prevention policies. However, when dealing with the home environment, and especially with older adults, obtrusiveness, usability, and cost concerns are of the utmost relevance. Smart objects can be designed to this purpose and deployed into the home: they usually feature low data rates and are customarily implemented by relying on conventional wireless sensor network approaches (ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc). This, however, results in &#x201C;ad hoc&#x201D; home networking, which is somehow obtrusive, complicated, and possibly expensive. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of behavioral sensors based on the familiar and ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology, suitable for a &#x201C;plug-and-play&#x201D; deployment. Sensors are connected to a cloud platform, embodying a genuine Internet of Things approach. With respect to conventional approaches, much better scalability, flexibility, and inexpensiveness can be attained. The main expected drawback comes from the higher power consumption, inherently needed to sustain much higher data rates. This paper focuses on such an issue, illustrating design techniques aimed at optimizing power consumption and battery lifetime. Performance results are shown, which definitely fall within a practical range and are fully comparable with more conventional approaches.",

abstract = "This paper presents the development of a decision support system for run-time safety management in Smart Work Environments (SWEs). Our approach consists of four main phases: (i) definition of the basic steps of a methodology for run-time safety management; (ii) development of an ontological knowledge-base of safety in work environments; (iii) definition of constraints on the ontology based on organizations’ safety protocols; (iv) communication of relevant information to each actor in the safety management team. We propose a generic ontological model of safety expertise, based on Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (OSHA), that is employed as Knowledge required in our safety management methodology based on the MAPE-K (Monitor–Analyze–Plan–Execute and Knowledge) loop. We present the RAMIRES (Risk-Adaptive Management in Resilient Environments with Security) tool, implementing this methodology. RAMIRES is developed as a dashboard, supporting the safety management team in understanding the risk and its consequences, and to support decision making in risk treatment. RAMIRES interacts with the SWE and the safety management team (actors) in order to: (i) communicate the risks and preventive strategies to actors; (ii) obtain more data about the observed areas to understand the risk and its consequences; and (iii) execute the automatic preventive strategies and support actors in the execution of human-operated preventive strategies. In this paper, we show the details on concepts designed in the safety ontology and illustrate how these concepts can be extended to provide an abstract model of a specific use case. Furthermore, we propose the definition of constraints on the ontology using logic-based rules.

Currently, a multisubstrate approach is employed, where soft and hard devices are fabricated or assembled on separate substrates, and bonded or interfaced using connectors; this hinders the flexibility of the device and is prone to interconnect issues. Here, a single substrate interfacing approach is reported, where soft devices, i.e., sensors, are directly printed on Kapton polyimide substrates that are widely used for fabricating flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs). Utilizing a process flow compatible with the FPCB assembly process, a wearable sensor patch is fabricated composed of inkjet‐printed gold electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes and a stencil‐printed nickel oxide thermistor. The ECG electrodes provide 1 mV– ECG signal at 4.7 cm electrode spacing and the thermistor is highly sensitive at normal body temperatures, and demonstrates temperature coefficient, α ≈ –5.84% K and material constant, β ≈ 4330 K. This sensor platform can be extended to a more sophisticated multisensor platform where sensors fabricated using solution processable functional inks can be interfaced to hard electronics for health and performance monitoring, as well as internet of things applications. and a stencil‐printed nickel oxide thermistor to silicon integrated circuits.

Our system indirectly measures fill-level by sensing the changes in motor-induced vibration characteristics on the outside surface of waste bins. VibeBin exploits the physical nature of vibration resonance of the waste bin and the garbage within, and learns the vibration features of different fill-levels through a few garbage collection (emptying) cycles in a completely unsupervised manner. VibeBin identifies vibration features of different fill-levels by clustering historical vibration samples based on a custom distance metric which measures the dissimilarity between two samples. We deploy our system on eight waste bins of different types and sizes, and show that under normal usage and real waste, it can deliver accurate level measurements after just 3 garbage collection cycles. The average F-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of measuring empty, half, and full levels achieves 0.912. A two-week deployment also shows that the false positive and false negative events are satisfactorily rare.</p></p>",

IoT allows people and objects in the physical world as well as data and virtual environments to interact with each other so as to create smart environments, such as smart transport systems, smart cities, smart health, and so on. However, IoT raises some important questions and also introduces new challenges for the security of systems and processes and the privacy of individuals, such as their location and movements and so on. In this paper, at first, we propose a distributed IoT system architecture. Subsequently, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme, which can ensure some of the notable properties, such as sensor anonymity, sensor untraceability, resistance to replay attacks, cloning attacks, and so on. It is argued that the proposed authentication scheme will be useful in many distributed IoT applications (such as radio-frequency identification-based IoT system, Biosensor-based IoT healthcare system, and so on), where the privacy of the sensor movement is greatly desirable.",

abstract = "Pervasive healthcare is one of the most important applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). As part of the IoT, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are responsible for sensing the abnormal behavior of the elderly or patients. In this article, we design and implement a fall detection system called SensFall . With the resource restricted sensor nodes, it is vital to find an efficient feature to describe the scene. Based on the optical flow analysis, it can be observed that the thermal energy variation of each sub-region of the monitored region is a salient spatio-temporal feature that characterizes the fall. The main contribution of this study is to develop a feature-specific sensing system to capture this feature so as to detect the occurrence of a fall. In our system, the three-dimensional (3D) object space is segmented into some distinct discrete sampling cells, and pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are employed to detect the variance of the thermal flux within these cells. The hierarchical classifier (two-layer HMMs) is proposed to model the time-varying PIR signal and classify different human activities. We use self-developed PIR sensor nodes mounted on the ceiling and construct a WSN based on ZigBee (802.15.4) protocol. We conduct experiments in a real office environment. The volunteers simulate several kinds of activities including falling, sitting down, standing up from a chair, walking, and jogging. Encouraging experimental results confirm the efficacy of our system.",

Various real-world applications of WSNs such as in smart grids, smart farming and smart health would require a potential deployment of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of sensor nodes/actuators. To ensure proper working order and network efficiency of such a network of sensor nodes, an effective WSN management system has to be integrated. However, the inherent challenges of WSNs such as sensor/actuator heterogeneity, application dependency and resource constraints have led to challenges in implementing effective traditional WSN management. This difficulty in management increases as the WSN becomes larger. Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides a promising solution in flexible management WSNs by allowing the separation of the control logic from the sensor nodes/actuators. The advantage with this SDN-based management in WSNs is that it enables centralized control of the entire WSN making it simpler to deploy network-wide management protocols and applications on demand. This paper highlights some of the recent work on traditional WSN management in brief and reviews SDN-based management techniques for WSNs in greater detail while drawing attention to the advantages that SDN brings to traditional WSN management. This paper also investigates open research challenges in coming up with mechanisms for flexible and easier SDN-based WSN configuration and management.",

Materials and Methods: A targeted convenience sample of 465 individuals and 134 researchers completed an extensive online survey. Thirty-five hour-long semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of 11 individuals and 9 researchers, as well as 15 company/key informants. Results: Challenges to the use of PHD for research were identified in six areas: data ownership; data access for research; privacy; informed consent and ethics; research methods and data quality; and the unpredictable nature of the rapidly evolving ecosystem of devices, apps, and other services that leave “digital footprints.” Individuals reported willingness to anonymously share PHD if it would be used to advance research for the good of the public. Researchers were enthusiastic about using PHD for research, but noted barriers related to intellectual property, licensing, and the need for legal agreements with companies. Companies were interested in research but stressed that their first priority was maintaining customer relationships. Conclusion: Although challenges exist in leveraging PHD for research, there are many opportunities for stakeholder engagement, and experimentation with these data is already taking place. These early examples foreshadow a much larger set of activities with the potential to positively transform how health research is conducted.",

BackgroundExtensive deployment and sustainability of integrated care services (ICS) constitute an unmet need to reduce the burden of chronic conditions. The European Union project NEXES (2008–2013) assessed the deployment of four ICS encompassing the spectrum of severity of chronic patients. ObjectiveThe current study aims to (i) describe the open source Adaptive Case Management (ACM) system (Linkcare®) developed to support the deployment of ICS at the level of healthcare district; (ii) to evaluate its performance; and, (iii) to identify key challenges for regional deployment of ICS. MethodsWe first defined a conceptual model for ICS management and execution composed of five main stages. We then specified an associated logical model considering the dynamic runtime of ACM. Finally, we implemented the four ICS as a physical model with an ICS editor to allow professionals (case managers) to play active roles in adapting the system to their needs. Instances of ICS were then run in Linkcare®. Four ICS provided a framework for evaluating the system: Wellness and Rehabilitation (W&R) (number of patients enrolled in the study (n)=173); Enhanced Care (EC) in frail chronic patients to prevent hospital admissions, (n=848); Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (HH/ED) (n=2314); and, Support to remote diagnosis (Support) (n=7793). The method for assessment of telemedicine applications (MAST) was used for iterative evaluation. ResultsLinkcare® supports ACM with shared-care plans across healthcare tiers and offers integration with provider-specific electronic health records. Linkcare® successfully contributed to the deployment of the four ICS: W&R facilitated long-term sustainability of training effects (p<0.01) and active life style (p<0.03); EC showed significant positive outcomes (p<0.05); HH/ED reduced on average 5 in-hospital days per patient with a 30-d re-admission rate of 10%; and, Support, enhanced community-based quality forced spirometry testing (p<0.01). Key challenges for regional deployment of personalized care were identified. ConclusionsLinkcare® provided the required functionalities to support integrated care adopting an ACM model, and it showed adaptive potential for its implementation in different health scenarios. The research generated strategies that contributed to face the challenges of the transition toward personalized medicine for chronic patients.",

Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called “Big Data.” Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called “Intelligent Building,” depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system has the capability of efficiently processing WBAN sensory data from millions of users in order to perform real-time responses in case of emergencies.",

This study proves that including standard telematics variables significantly improves the risk assessment of customers. As a result, insurers will be better able to tailor their products to the customers' risk profile. Moreover, this research illustrates the importance of including industry knowledge, combined with data expertise, in the variable creation process. Especially when a regulator forces the use of easily interpretable data mining techniques, expert-based telematics variables are able to improve the risk assessment model in addition to the standard telematics variables. Further, the results suggest that if a manager wants to implement Usage-Based-Insurances, Pay-As-You-Drive related variables are most valuable to tailor the premium to the risk.

Induction of smart gadgetries, people lifestyle equipped with wearables, and development of IoT has revitalized the feature scale of these applications. The landscape of health applications encountering big data need to be replotted on cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources of handheld devices. With this transformation, the outcome from certain health applications is significant where precise, user-centric, and personalized recommendations mimic like a personal care-giver round the clock. To maximize the services spectrum from these applications over cloud, certain challenges like data privacy and communication cost need serious attention. Following the existing trend together with an ambition to promote and assist users with healthy lifestyle we propose a framework of Health Fog where Fog computing is used as an intermediary layer between the cloud and end users. The design feature of Health Fog successfully reduces the extra communication cost that is usually found high in similar systems. For enhanced and flexible control of data privacy and security, we also introduce the cloud access security broker (CASB) as an integral component of Health Fog where certain polices can be implemented accordingly. The modular framework design of Health Fog is capable of engaging data from multiple resources together with adequate level of security and privacy using existing cryptographic primitives.

IoT devices will just have to work, says Tony King-Smith of UK firm Imagination Technologies, which makes chips for smartphones. So devices are being designed to recognize one another, acquire the data they need from communications hubs and begin operating without lifting a finger. But that creates a security problem. As the number of connected devices increases, the potential for malicious software in one device infecting the others is profound, says David Boundy, a chief researcher at Intel in Ireland. For instance, he says, malware that activates everyone's heating systems at once could overload the grid and cause blackouts.",

Ten years ago, data analytics was an awful lot hotter than it was back in the 1990s; now it's so much hotter than it was 10 years ago. There is a triumvirate of factors driving this, which include the greatly increased availability of data; the fact that computers are now fast enough to analyze it; and the maturing of the analytical technology itself. He added that thinking that managers need to understand that data analytics is much more like R&D than it is like most projects that managers are accustomed to managing. The best way to manage data science is not through mega-projects but by going through cycles of increasing investment, reducing uncertainty with each cycle.",

abstract = "  The world's largest aerospace companies are all scrambling to acquire a slice of capability that will allow them to prepare for the Internet of Things. It's becoming more and more apparent that businesses are at risk of disintermediation from lack of understanding of data. Whoever harnesses the data controls the industry. Yet adding a radically diferent new capability to a well-established business is not easy. Even the most sophisticated well-established companies are running into many obstacles. Software is diferent. Software engineers have a loyalty to the software, not to the company they work for or the markets in which the software is used. With companies such as Google and Facebook setting the benchmark, employees expect to be treated diferently, with a fexible working environment and fast-rising stock options. This model does not ft the way the aerospace majors work, and so it's not surprising that key talent often walks out the door soon after an acquisition. The parent company's shareholders, in general, are interested in short-term performance. Persuading shareholders of an aerospace company to make a longterm bet on a loss-making software company on a multiple of fve or six times sales is not easy, but this level of multiple is commonplace in the high-tech world. What is more, software companies are usually at such an early stage that no one really knows where the technology will deliver the most business value. For example, one engine company invested in analytical software to predict engine problems only to fnd that the biggest market for this software was in healthcare.",

There is no literature related to patient follow-up that incorporates the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), use of WiFi, Internet, or portable devices for this purpose. Material and methods: This prospective observational study commenced in June 2011. Patients were prospectively offered to participate in the IoT study group, in which they received a WiFi scale (Withing, Paris) that provides instant WiFi data to the patient and surgeon. Other patients were admitted to the standard follow-up group at the outpatient clinic. A total of 33 patients were included in our study (ten in the IoT group). Results: Twelve patients did not have WiFi at home, ten lacked of computer knowledge, and seven preferred standard for follow-up. All patients underwent different surgical procedures. There were no complications. Excess weight loss (EWL) was similar in both groups. More than 90% of patients were satisfied. In the IoT group, patients considered it valuable in saving time, and considered seeing their evolution graphics extremely motivating. Conclusion: IoT technology can monitor medical parameters remotely and collect data. A WiFi scale can facilitate preoperative and follow-up. Standard follow-up in a classical outpatient clinic setting with the surgeon was preferred globally.",
