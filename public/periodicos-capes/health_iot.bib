Because of the increasing number of elderly and disabled people, there is an urgent need for a real-time health monitoring infrastructure for analyzing patients’ healthcare data to avoid preventable deaths. Healthcare Industrial IoT (HealthIIoT) has significant potential for the realization of such monitoring. HealthIIoT is a combination of communication technologies, interconnected apps, Things (devices and sensors), and people that would function together as one smart system to monitor, track, and store patients’ healthcare information for ongoing care. This paper presents a HealthIIoT-enabled monitoring framework, where ECG and other healthcare data are collected by mobile devices and sensors and securely sent to the cloud for seamless access by healthcare professionals. Signal enhancement, watermarking, and other related analytics will be used to avoid identity theft or clinical error by healthcare professionals. The suitability of this approach has been validated through both experimental evaluation, and simulation by deploying an IoT-driven ECG-based health monitoring service in the cloud.",

Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called {"}Big Data.{"} Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called {"}Intelligent Building,{"} depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system.

It examines the organizational dynamics of IoMT and develops a conceptual model for quality of experience (QoE) in user acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the information systems success model of quality factor as an analytical framework and extends it beyond the individual user experience (UX) to include an organization-level perspective. Interviews are conducted with relevant stakeholders for sociotechnical inquiries; a survey identifies user factors in IoMT. Findings The sociotechnical analysis sheds light on how IoMT has been accepted and stabilized in the healthcare sector. It shows the complex interaction between the social and technical aspects of IoMT by highlighting the co-evolution, interaction, and interface of devices that constitute the next-generation network environment. The UX model conceptualizes QoE specific to medical informatics. Research limitations/implications Given the sociotechnical nature of this investigation, another approach to adoption of IoMT innovations was worth investigating to determine effective integration. Practical implications IoMT needs to be meaningful if they are to be sustainable and they need to offer quality of services and QoE no matter the location or demographic in which they are used. Originality/value With a dual-level analysis, the study provides a comprehensive view of the IoMT development process by investigating the organizational dynamics, in addition to the UX, of IoMT. The results provide a basis for developing future IoMT services with QoE requirements, as well as for clarifying sociotechnical dynamics. </p>",

The number of people with a chronic disease is rapidly increasing, giving the healthcare industry more challenging problems. To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology–aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-making knowledge using Protégé Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient for patient risk factors extraction and diabetes prescriptions.",

In particular, the reliability and effectiveness of the packets transmission will be directly related to the timely rescue of critically ill patients with life-threatening injuries. However, traditional fault-tolerant schemes either have the deficiency of underutilised resources or react too slowly to failures. In future healthcare systems, the medical Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring can integrate sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data techniques to address these problems. It can collect and send patient’s vital parameter signal and safety monitoring information to intelligent terminals and enhance transmission reliability and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a design in healthcare monitoring systems for a proactive reliable data transmission mechanism with resilience requirements in a many-to-one stream model. This Network Coding-based Fault-tolerant Mechanism (NCFM) first proposes a greedy grouping algorithm to divide the topology into small logical units; it then constructs a spanning tree based on random linear network coding to generate linearly independent coding combinations. Numerical results indicate that this transmission scheme works better than traditional methods in reducing the probability of packet loss, the resource redundant rate, and average delay, and can increase the effective throughput rate.",

This model of client–server data communication has evolved into a peer-to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times. Applications like, YouTube, Bit Torrent, social networks have revolutionized the idea of user generated contents. Modern users care only for specific data items irrespective of their sources. So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth.

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving e-health system, which is a fusion of Internet-of-things (IoT), big data and cloud storage. The medical IoT network monitors patient’s physiological data, which are aggregated to electronic health record (EHR). The medical big data that contains a large amount of EHRs are outsourced to cloud platform. In the proposed system, the patient distributes an IoT group key to the medical nodes in an authenticated way without interaction round. The IoT messages are encrypted using the IoT group key and transmitted to the patient, which can be batch authenticated by the patient. The encrypted EHRs are shared among patient and different data users in a fine-grained access control manner. A novel keyword match based policy update mechanism is designed to enable flexible access policy updating without privacy leakage. Extensive comparison and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms in the proposed system are efficient. Comprehensive analysis is provided to prove its security. •Anonymity and traceability of patient and medical node: In this system, anonymous identities are assigned for both patient and medical nodes, which is calculated from their real identities. If an anonymous patient is found dishonest or misbehaving, the trusted authority is capable to trace his real identity. If an anonymous medical node is compromised and utilized to launch attack in patient’s IoT network, the patient can also recover the node’s real identity.•Authenticated IoT key distribution: In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the messages transmitted in the health IoT network, the patient generates a symmetric key and sends it to all the medical nodes (in patient’s IoT network) in a privacy-preserving way. A key extraction auxiliary message is created by the patient to encapsulate the IoT key. Receiving the message, the medical nodes authenticate that whether the auxiliary message is indeed sent by the patient to prevent impersonation attack.•Authenticated IoT ciphertext transmission: After the IoT key is extracted by the medical nodes, the generated IoT messages are encrypted by the key and sends to the patient. To ensure the reliability of the source, the patient authenticates the IoT ciphertext and then decrypt it. A large amount of IoT ciphertexts may arrive at the same time period, our system also provides a batch verification algorithm to improve the efficiency.•Lightweight fine-grained access control: The e-health big data are encrypted and stored in a cloud platform. To prevent unauthorized data access, our system designs an expressive and lightweight fine-grained access control mechanism. The patient controls the electronic health record (EHR) encryption procedure, and defines an access policy such that the data users with specific attributes can decrypt patient’s medical files. The algorithms in the access control mechanism are lightweight constructions.•Flexible subset keyword match based access policy update: We design a novel access policy update mechanism based on keyword match. When the patient wants to change the access policy, he does not need to download all his EHR ciphertexts, decrypt them and re-encrypt them with a new access policy. In our system, the patient generates a privacy-preserving policy update query, which is sent to the cloud server. Then, the cloud server updates the match files without knowing the plaintext. A highlight is that the policy update process is keyword match based. If the patient wants to update the access policy of the EHRs that contains certain keywords, the query keywords are embedded in the policy update query. Only the access policy match files that contains these query keywords as subset keywords will be updated.",

Patient Physiological Parameters (PPPs) seem to be the most extensively accessed and utilized Personal Health Information (PHI) in hospitals, and their utilization by the various medical entities for treatment and diagnosis creates a real threat to patient privacy. This study aims to investigate whether PPPs access in a hospital environment violates patient privacy. If so, to what extent can we manage patient privacy while accessing PPPs in this environment? We investigated this question by analyzing questionnaire-based data from two Asian countries: Group A (China) and Group B (Pakistan). For data collection, we targeted those medical entities which were directly dealing with PPPs in their routine tasks. Results suggest that patient type directly influences the collection of PPPs: Group A (one-time = 1.9, follow-up = 1.06) and Group B (one-time = 2.0 and follow-up = 1.9). Both groups agreed that patients have the right to control their own PPPs. In both, doctors are the most trusted entity: for Group A, the Pearson Chi-Square with one degree of freedom is 1.414, p = 0.234, whereas for Group B, the Pearson Chi-Square with three degrees of freedom is 4.511, p = 0.11. Most of the Group A entities (92%) are familiar with unauthorized access of PPPs, while in Group B the level was only 35%. In Group B, only 35% of entities stated the purpose, specification and use limitations of PPPs. Doctors in both groups showed a high utilization of PPPs read authorization rights. This empirical evidence about PPPs usage in both countries will benefit health technology and improve policy on patient privacy.",

In addition to this, the presented framework is supported by a mathematical foundation to predict probabilistic vulnerability, in terms of Probabilistic State of Vulnerability (PSoV). In order to determine the validity and applicability of the proposed framework, experiments were performed where 5 people with different attributes are monitored for 14 days using numerous smart sensors.

The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS.

The QRS complex is a combination of three of the graphic deflection seen on a typical ECG. This study proposes a real-time QRS detection and R point recognition method with low computational complexity while maintaining a high accuracy. The enhancement of QRS segments and restraining of P and T waves are carried out by the proposed ECG signal transformation, which also leads to the elimination of baseline wandering. In this study, the QRS fiducial point is determined based on the detected crests and troughs of the transformed signal. Subsequently, the R point can be recognized based on four QRS waveform templates and preliminary heart rhythm classification can be also achieved at the same time. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the benchmark of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, where the QRS detected sensitivity (Se) and positive prediction (+P) are 99.82% and 99.81%, respectively.

abstract = "Traditionally, production control on construction sites has been challenging, and still remains challenging. The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long “lookahead” planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully or partially automate various communication functions across the construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then provides first insights – through various construction scenarios – into how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management to the management of the entire building lifecycle. •IoT standards are considered to enhance lean construction management systems.•The proposed framework helps to improve information flow throughout the construction project, and beyond•Major opportunities and challenges of developing such a framework are detailed•First proofs-of-concept of how the developed framework can be implemented in construction projects are provided.",

The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors affecting cyberloafing between public and private sector organizations. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the multiple motivational factors with the help of a theoretical paradigm, renowned as theory of interpersonal behavior (TIB). Data were collected through questionnaire to investigate the different behavioral factors between the public and private sector organizations. PLS path modeling and PLS-MGA are used to access the results on SMARTPLS 2.0 software. Findings Results show that the three factors of habit, intention, and social influences taken from the TIB model are important and have a higher path coefficient in a public sector organization setting. The factors of affect, facilitating condition and perceived consequences from TIB are greater in a private sector organization and have a higher path coefficient. By contrast, in multiple group analysis, results show that some factors are more predictive of cyberloafing behavior in a public sector organization, whereas other factors are more predictive for a private sector organization. Practical implications The findings of the current research are beneficial for both organizations and contribute toward policy-making decisions. These results help the managers of public and private sector organizations to decide how to control cyberloafing behavior by focusing on the important factors that lead to it. Originality/value This study shows strong and significant differences between the two types of organizations in terms of path coefficient. This implies that cyberloafing factors have different impacts on different organizations. The study fills an important gap in comparing public and private sector organizations with respect to cyberloafing behavior and clarifying which factors are more effective in predicting cyberloafing behavior according to type of organization. The paper is of great value for both kinds of organizations that face cyberloafing behavior issues.",

Third, a global link decision (GLD) scheme is devised to improve overall reliability and decrease overall delay simultaneously through raising availability of battery energy within nodes. Theoretical analysis demonstrated the validity of the GLD scheme.

Smartphone, sensor devices, cellular communication, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recent technologies that provide new mobile location based services. Such services could help mobile tourists, i.e. tourist who is currently moving between various sites, to get innovative set of services which make their trip easier and safer. Designing efficient solutions that help tourists with chronic diseases to find an appropriate geographical route from a source to a tourism destination through a transportation network is crucial to healthcare systems. This paper proposes a new approach in generating geographical routes that are best served with close medical centers. Our approach, called Geographical Routing for Mobile Tourist (GRMT), selects a route that is best served with medical centers, and goes through the path that is as shortest as possible in regards with the distance. We have modeled and simulated the proposed approach using simulation program. Simulated experimental results show that GRMT allows tourists to select geographical routes that are served with the highest number of close medical centers although the selected route is slightly longer in distance. •An IoT architecture connecting a health-worrier tourist to nearby healthcare centers is introduced.•An approach to find a geographical route that is best served with healthcare centers is proposed.•An analytical model for weighing various available geographical routes is presented.•Routes weighing is based on closeness, speciality, and number of nearby healthcare centers.•The efficiency of the proposed approach in overcoming tourists travel constraints was evaluated via simulation.",

Here we report a novel paradigm for sensing modulators: a graphene field-effect transistor device that directly modulates a radio frequency (RF) electrical carrier signal when exposed to chemical agents, with a memory effect in its electrochemical history. We demonstrated the concept and implementation of this graphene-based sensing modulator through a frequency-modulation (FM) experiment conducted in a modulation cycle consisting of alternating phases of air exposure and ethanol or water treatment. In addition, we observed an analog memory effect in terms of the charge neutrality point of the graphene, V cnp , which strongly influences the FM results, and developed a calibration method using electrochemical gate-voltage pulse sequences. This graphene-based multifunctional device shows great potential for use in a simple, low-cost, and ultracompact nanomaterial-based nodal architecture to enable continuous, real-time event-based monitoring in pervasive healthcare IoTs, ubiquitous security systems, and other chemical/molecular/gas monitoring applications.",

The purpose of this paper is to address the gap by developing and testing a theoretical model that links venturing principles (effectuation or causation) to new internet venture growth through resource bundling (pioneering or stabilizing). Design/methodology/approach - The proposed theoretical model is developed upon the entrepreneurship literature and resource-based view. Empirical data are collected from entrepreneurs and top executives in China via a survey. The Baron and Kenny (1986) mediation model assessment procedure is used to analyze the data. Findings - Both effectuation and causation are positively associated with new internet venture growth. Effectuation leads to pioneering resource bundling, which in turn contributes to new internet venture growth. Causation also contributes to new internet venture growth, but through stabilizing resource bundling. Research limitations/implications - This research helps link the theory of effectuation to resource-based theory by revealing resource bundling as the mediator between effectuation, causation, and new venture growth. Moreover, the authors provide empirical evidence of the importance of resource bundling with entrepreneurial strategic decision logics to the growth of new internet ventures in transitional economies. Practical implications - Entrepreneurs and managers of new internet ventures should leverage both venturing principles to support growth. Internet ventures generally are creative and innovative in nature, hence favor effectuation. But it will be unwise to ignore causation, which also leads to growth.

abstract = "Wearable wireless networks (WWNs) offer innovative ways to connect humans and/or objects anywhere, anytime, within an infinite variety of applications. WWNs include three levels of communications: on-body, body-to-body and off-body communication. Successful communication in on-body and body-to-body networks is often challenging due to ultra-low power consumption, processing and storage capabilities, which have a significant impact on the achievable throughput and packet reception ratio as well as latency. Consequently, all these factors make it difficult to opt for an appropriate technology to optimize communication performance, which predominantly depends on the given application. In particular, this work emphasizes the impact of coarse-grain factors (such as dynamic and diverse mobility, radio-link and signal propagation, interference management, data dissemination schemes, and routing approaches) directly affecting the communication performance in WWNs. Experiments have been performed on a real testbed to investigate the connectivity behavior on two wireless communication levels: on-body and body-to-body. It is concluded that by considering the impact of above-mentioned factors, the general perception of using specific technologies may not be correct. Indeed, for on-body communication, by using the IEEE 802.15.6 standard (which is specifically designed for on-body communication), it is observed that while operating at low transmission power under realistic conditions, the connectivity can be significantly low, thus, the transmission power has to be tuned carefully. Similarly, for body-to-body communication in an indoor environment, WiFi IEEE 802.11n also has a high threshold of end-to-end disconnections beyond two hops (approximatively 25 m). Therefore, these facts promote the use of novel technologies such as 802.11ac, NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) etc. as possible candidates for body-to-body communications as a part of the Internet of humans concept.",

As more people use P2P systems, the scalability and flexibility of the systems must be considered. In this study, an arrangement graph is used to form a P2P overlay, the Arrangement-Graph Overlay (AGO), to reduce system overhead and bind routing hops. The proposed AGO utilizes the properties of the arrangement graph, i.e., that each node has a unique ID and IDs between adjacent nodes differ by only one digit, to form the overlay network and develop a routing algorithm. The routing hops of the proposed AGO system can be bound within a certain number because of the diameter of the arrangement graph. Experimental results show that the proposed AGO system can greatly reduce system overhead and perform routing in a constant number of hops, even in a large-scale network environment. The experimental results also show that the AGO system consumes less bandwidth, which is an important consideration in P2P systems.",

We address the reliability challenges in setting up a wireless autonomous communication system in order to offload data from the disaster area (rescuers, trapped victims, civilians, media, etc.) back to a command center. The proposed system connects deployed rescuers to extended networks and the Internet. CROW 22 is an end-to-end system that runs the recently-proposed Optimized Routing Approach for Critical and Emergency Networks (ORACE-Net) routing protocol. The system integrates heterogeneous wireless devices (Raspberry Pi, smart phones, sensors) and various communicating technologies (WiFi IEEE 802.11n, Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1) to enable end-to-end network connectivity, which is monitored by a cloud Internet-of-Things platform. First, we present the CROW 22 generic system architecture, which is adaptable to various technologies integration at different levels (i.e., on-body, body-to-body, off-body). Second, we implement the ORACE-Net protocol on heterogeneous devices including Android-based smart phones and Linux-based Raspberry Pi devices. These devices act as on-body coordinators to collect information from on-body sensors. The collected data is then pushed to the command center thanks to multi-hop device-to-device communication. Third, the overall CROW 22 system performance is evaluated according to relevant metrics including end-to-end link quality estimation, throughput and end-to-end delay. As a proof-of-concept, we validate the system architecture through deployment and extracted experimental results. Finally, we highlight motion detection and links’ unavailability prevention based on the recorded data where the main factors (i.e., interference and noise) that affect the performance are analyzed.",

Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned.

Internet of Things (IoT) has radically transformed the world; currently, every device can be connected to the Internet and provide valuable information for decision-making. In spite of the fast evolution of technologies accompanying the grow of IoT, we are still faced with the challenge of providing a service oriented architecture, which facilitates the inclusion of data coming together from several IoT devices, data delivery among a system's agents, real-time data processing and service provision to users. Furthermore, context-aware data processing and architectures still pose a challenge, in spite of being key requirements in order to get stronger IoT architectures. To face this challenge, we propose a COLLaborative ConText Aware Service Oriented Architecture (COLLECT), which facilitates both the integration of IoT heterogeneous domain context data — through the use of a light message broker — and easy data delivery among several agents and collaborative participants in the system — making use of an enterprise service bus —. In addition, this architecture provides real-time data processing thanks to the use of a complex event processing engine as well as services and intelligent decision-making procedures to users according to the needs of the domain in question. As a result, COLLECT has a great impact on context-aware decentralized and collaborative reasoning for IoT, promoting context-aware intelligent decision making in such scope.

In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities.

In this paper, the problem is addressed through a joint interest, physical and energy-aware clustering and resource management framework, capitalizing on the wireless powered communication (WPC) technique. Within the proposed framework the numerous M2M devices initially form different clusters based on the low complexity Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), properly adapted to account for interest, physical and energy related factors. Following that, a cluster-head is selected among the members of each cluster. The proposed approach enables the devices of a cluster with the support of the cluster-head to harvest and store energy in a stable manner through Radio Frequency (RF) signals adopting the WPC paradigm, thus prolonging the operation of the overall M2M network. Each M2M device is associated with a generic utility function, which appropriately represents its degree of satisfaction in relation to the consumed transmission power. Based on the distributed nature of the M2M network, a maximization problem of each device's utility function is formulated as a non-cooperative game and its unique Nash equilibrium point is determined, in terms of devices’ optimal transmission powers. Considering the devices’ equilibrium transmission powers, the optimal charging transmission powers of the cluster-heads are derived. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via modeling and simulation and under various topologies and scenarios, and its operational efficiency and effectiveness is demonstrated.",

Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.</p></p>",

abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

The CDSS is used to provide a personalized report on persons‟ health condition based on daily basis observation on vital signs. Six participants, from Spain (n=3) and Slovenia (n=3) have been using the proposed healthcare system for eight weeks (e.g. 300+ health measurements) in their home environments to monitor their health. The sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of the DSS‟s classification are achieved as 90%, 97% and 96% respectively while k=2 i.e., top 2 most similar retrieved cases are considered.

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.",

It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

In the context of myriad factors that influence blood glucose dynamics for each individual patient (eg, medication, activity, diet, stress, sleep quality, hormones, environment), such coordination of self-management and clinical care is a great challenge, amplified by the routine unavailability of many types of data thought to be useful in diabetes decision-making. While much remains to be understood about the physiology of diabetes and blood glucose dynamics at the level of the individual, recent and emerging medical and consumer technologies are helping the diabetes community to take great strides toward truly personalized, real-time, data-driven management of this chronic disease. This review describes “connected” technologies—such as smartphone apps, and wearable devices and sensors—which comprise part of a new digital ecosystem of data-driven tools that can link patients and their care teams for precision management of diabetes. These connected technologies are rich sources of physiologic, behavioral, and contextual data that can be integrated and analyzed in “the cloud” for research into personal models of glycemic dynamics, and employed in a multitude of applications for mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine in diabetes care.",

Linear programming QoS metric expressions are derived and employed to maximize the network lifetime, throughput, minimizing delay. Results show that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) outperforms other modulation techniques for the proposed I2O WBAN systems, enabling the support of a 30 Mbps data transmission rate up to 1.6 m and affording more reliable communication links when the transmitter power is increased.

Due to their life- or mission-critical nature, these systems need to provide a high level of availability and accuracy. On the one hand, centralized cloud-based IoT systems lack reliability, punctuality and availability (e.g., in case of slow or unreliable Internet connection), and on the other hand, fully outsourcing data analytics to the edge of the network can result in diminished level of accuracy and adaptability due to the limited computational capacity in edge nodes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a hierarchical computing architecture, HiCH, for IoT-based health monitoring systems. The core components of the proposed system are 1) a novel computing architecture suitable for hierarchical partitioning and execution of machine learning based data analytics, 2) a closed-loop management technique capable of autonomous system adjustments with respect to patient's condition. HiCH benefits from the features offered by both fog and cloud computing and introduces a tailored management methodology for healthcare IoT systems.
