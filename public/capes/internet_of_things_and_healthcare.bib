abstract = "Today, telemedicine has a great reputation because of its capacity to provide quality healthcare services to remote locations. To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented to experimentally analyze and compare the resource efficiency of different SAT verification approaches in terms of a number of performance metrics, including computation and communication overhead.",

As part of the IoT, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are responsible for sensing the abnormal behavior of the elderly or patients. In this article, we design and implement a fall detection system called SensFall . With the resource restricted sensor nodes, it is vital to find an efficient feature to describe the scene. Based on the optical flow analysis, it can be observed that the thermal energy variation of each sub-region of the monitored region is a salient spatio-temporal feature that characterizes the fall. The main contribution of this study is to develop a feature-specific sensing system to capture this feature so as to detect the occurrence of a fall. In our system, the three-dimensional (3D) object space is segmented into some distinct discrete sampling cells, and pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are employed to detect the variance of the thermal flux within these cells. The hierarchical classifier (two-layer HMMs) is proposed to model the time-varying PIR signal and classify different human activities. We use self-developed PIR sensor nodes mounted on the ceiling and construct a WSN based on ZigBee (802.15.4) protocol. We conduct experiments in a real office environment. The volunteers simulate several kinds of activities including falling, sitting down, standing up from a chair, walking, and jogging.

This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT.

To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.",

Cognitive radio is able to exploit spectrum opportunities and increase the communication performance for the e-healthcare system. To access the spectrum safely, the security aspect of spectrum utilization should be carefully addressed. A well-known threat to the spectrum utilization is the primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in which the attackers emulate as the primary users to obtain spectrum opportunities. To defend this threat, in this paper, we propose a triple threshold energy detection (TTED) to identify the PUEA. Based on the TTED, legitimate devices are allowed to access the available channels when the licensed channel is idle or occupied by attackers. To evaluate our proposed access scheme, we derive the achievable throughput while the average transmission time is fixed and exponential distributed, respectively.

This is due to the fact that the IoT devices are highly heterogeneous in terms of underlying communication protocols, data formats, and technologies. Secondly due to lack of worldwide acceptable standards, interoperability tools remain limited. In this paper, we proposed an IoT based Semantic Interoperability Model (IoT-SIM) to provide Semantic Interoperability among heterogeneous IoT devices in healthcare domain. Physicians communicate their patients with heterogeneous IoT devices to monitor their current health status. Information between physician and patient is semantically annotated and communicated in a meaningful way. A lightweight model for semantic annotation of data using heterogeneous devices in IoT is proposed to provide annotations for data. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic web framework that is used to relate things using triples to make it semantically meaningful. RDF annotated patients’ data has made it semantically interoperable. SPARQL query is used to extract records from RDF graph. For simulation of system, we used Tableau, Gruff-6.2.0, and Mysql tools.",

Among them, wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs) have been used in the personalized healthcare systems (PHSs). In recent years, professionals use their mobile devices to access the data collected from sensors which are placed in or on patients’ bodies. Due to the danger of wireless transmission circumstance, the security of the data which are collected by the sensors and also transmitted to the doctors faces challenges. In the past decade, many authentication schemes for WMSNs are proposed. However, security disadvantages have been found in such schemes. To overcome the historical security problems, we propose a robust and lightweight authentication scheme for WMSNs, which meets the common security requirements, and keeps away user tracking from attackers. The popular tool Proverif is employed to express that our scheme resists the simulated attacks. Also, the informal security analysis is demonstrated. With the comparison to several very recent schemes and simulation by NS-3, the proposed scheme is suitable for PHSs. •A lightweight two-factor authentication scheme using WMSNs away from being tracked is presented.•We use the famous tool Proverif to prove that our scheme is secure against the common attacks.•The informal analysis and performance comparison with recent schemes show that ours is the best.•The simulation with NS-3 shows that our scheme is applicable for practice.",

Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.",

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1$\times$ and 7.8$\times$ were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18&#x0025; for lossy and 53&#x0025; for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.",

These will affect non-finalistic (warehouse, archive), diagnostic support (laboratory and image) and finalistic activities (emergency, surgical center, clinics) (2). The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is fundamental in the dimension of the impact of each technology on the structure of healthcare facilities (HCF). In this way, this work intends to evaluate the trends of impact of the new ICT on hospitals’ structure. METHODS: The main technologies under discussion in Management of HCF in Brazillian Health Regulatory Agency were raised. From this survey an impact matrix was built with hospital environmental design and the trends of adequacy of its space. RESULTS: ICT that tend to decrease the physical space are: electronic health record for the archive, use of digital imaging for radiology, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) for the warehouse, point of care and automated laboratory equipment for clinical laboratories. ICT that tend to increase physical space are: Telemedicine for the surgical center, Internet of Things - IoT for Intensive Care Units, beds for emergency and hospitalization. The technologies that present an undefined tendency in relation to physical space are: automatic dispensers of drugs for nursing posts. The use of database servers and the need for network points are still undefined due to the use of Wi-Fi technology and cloud storage. However, it's possible to increase use of electricity and the internet. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the new ICT will have an impact on the planning and building of the future HCF (3). The designs of today's buildings should consider this trend so that the future reality is adequate and the regulatory requirements about HCF should be able to consider it.",

It examines the organizational dynamics of IoMT and develops a conceptual model for quality of experience (QoE) in user acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the information systems success model of quality factor as an analytical framework and extends it beyond the individual user experience (UX) to include an organization-level perspective. Interviews are conducted with relevant stakeholders for sociotechnical inquiries; a survey identifies user factors in IoMT. Findings The sociotechnical analysis sheds light on how IoMT has been accepted and stabilized in the healthcare sector. It shows the complex interaction between the social and technical aspects of IoMT by highlighting the co-evolution, interaction, and interface of devices that constitute the next-generation network environment. The UX model conceptualizes QoE specific to medical informatics. Research limitations/implications Given the sociotechnical nature of this investigation, another approach to adoption of IoMT innovations was worth investigating to determine effective integration. Practical implications IoMT needs to be meaningful if they are to be sustainable and they need to offer quality of services and QoE no matter the location or demographic in which they are used. Originality/value With a dual-level analysis, the study provides a comprehensive view of the IoMT development process by investigating the organizational dynamics, in addition to the UX, of IoMT. The results provide a basis for developing future IoMT services with QoE requirements, as well as for clarifying sociotechnical dynamics.",

[...]instead of simply throwing money at the problem, especially on technology tools, organizations such as Group Health Cooperative (GHC), a Seattle-based health system, are focusing more on process improvement, automated incident response and early containment. Other tactics include strengthening internal environments through simulation techniques such as penetration tests and advanced analytics for correlations and geo-locational {"}hot-spotting,{"} which has become relevant recently in light of evidence indicating the involvement of nation-states in sophisticated cyberattacks. For their part, federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have swung into action to protect healthcare by defining security recommendations for device makers and guidelines for cloud service providers - a sort of “building code” update for IT infrastructure in healthcare.",

abstract = "Advancements in smart devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and communication paradigm have enabled the vision of smart cities, pervasive healthcare, augmented reality and interactive multimedia, Internet of Every Thing (IoE), and cognitive assistance, to name a few. All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing.

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.",

Identifying the resident’s activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12% improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition , which used dynamic segmentation. The f-measure metric demonstrated up to 12.73% improvement.",

BackgroundExtensive deployment and sustainability of integrated care services (ICS) constitute an unmet need to reduce the burden of chronic conditions. The European Union project NEXES (2008–2013) assessed the deployment of four ICS encompassing the spectrum of severity of chronic patients. ObjectiveThe current study aims to (i) describe the open source Adaptive Case Management (ACM) system (Linkcare®) developed to support the deployment of ICS at the level of healthcare district; (ii) to evaluate its performance; and, (iii) to identify key challenges for regional deployment of ICS. MethodsWe first defined a conceptual model for ICS management and execution composed of five main stages. We then specified an associated logical model considering the dynamic runtime of ACM. Finally, we implemented the four ICS as a physical model with an ICS editor to allow professionals (case managers) to play active roles in adapting the system to their needs. Instances of ICS were then run in Linkcare®. Four ICS provided a framework for evaluating the system: Wellness and Rehabilitation (W&R) (number of patients enrolled in the study (n)=173); Enhanced Care (EC) in frail chronic patients to prevent hospital admissions, (n=848); Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (HH/ED) (n=2314); and, Support to remote diagnosis (Support) (n=7793). The method for assessment of telemedicine applications (MAST) was used for iterative evaluation. ResultsLinkcare® supports ACM with shared-care plans across healthcare tiers and offers integration with provider-specific electronic health records. Linkcare® successfully contributed to the deployment of the four ICS: W&R facilitated long-term sustainability of training effects (p<0.01) and active life style (p<0.03); EC showed significant positive outcomes (p<0.05); HH/ED reduced on average 5 in-hospital days per patient with a 30-d re-admission rate of 10%; and, Support, enhanced community-based quality forced spirometry testing (p<0.01). Key challenges for regional deployment of personalized care were identified. ConclusionsLinkcare® provided the required functionalities to support integrated care adopting an ACM model, and it showed adaptive potential for its implementation in different health scenarios.

abstract = "<p>As a key technology in smart healthcare monitoring systems, wireless body area networks (WBANs) can pre-embed sensors and sinks on body surface or inside bodies for collecting different vital signs parameters, such as human Electrocardiograph (ECG), Electroencephalograph (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), body temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar, blood oxygen, etc. Using real-time online healthcare, patients can be tracked and monitored in normal or emergency conditions at their homes, hospital rooms, and in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). In particular, the reliability and effectiveness of the packets transmission will be directly related to the timely rescue of critically ill patients with life-threatening injuries. However, traditional fault-tolerant schemes either have the deficiency of underutilised resources or react too slowly to failures. In future healthcare systems, the medical Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring can integrate sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data techniques to address these problems. It can collect and send patient’s vital parameter signal and safety monitoring information to intelligent terminals and enhance transmission reliability and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a design in healthcare monitoring systems for a proactive reliable data transmission mechanism with resilience requirements in a many-to-one stream model. This Network Coding-based Fault-tolerant Mechanism (NCFM) first proposes a greedy grouping algorithm to divide the topology into small logical units; it then constructs a spanning tree based on random linear network coding to generate linearly independent coding combinations. Numerical results indicate that this transmission scheme works better than traditional methods in reducing the probability of packet loss, the resource redundant rate, and average delay, and can increase the effective throughput rate.</p>",

abstract = "Advances in human-centric technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), application-oriented sensing and smart home, along with recent developments in internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) networks are enabling the design and development of a smarter home with cognitive intelligence. In this paper, we first investigate the integration of smart home and botanical IoT for creating a better living environment to increase people’s quality of life. First, we point out that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment, while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the affective interaction between greeneries and home users. It is foreseeable that the emotion-aware capability of smart home 2.0 will bring more intelligent and interactive healthcare applications for urban residents in the future.",

abstract = "<p>We are in the midst of a healthcare paradigm shift driven by the wide adoption of ubiquitous computing and various modes of information communications technologies. As a result, cities worldwide are undergoing a major process of urbanization with ever increasing wealth of sensing capabilities – hence the Internet of Things (IoT). These trends impose great pressure on how healthcare is done. This paper describes the design and implementation of a situated clinical decision support (SCDSS) system, most appropriate for smart cities. The SCDSS was prototyped and enhanced in a clinic. The SCDSS was then used in a clinic as well as in a university hospital centre. In this article, the system’s architecture, subcomponents and integrated workflow are described. The systems’ design was the result of a knowledge acquisition process involving interviews with five specialists and testing with 50 patients. The reports (specialist consultation report) generated by the SCDSS were shown to general practitioners who were not able to distinguish them from human specialist reports. We propose a context-aware CDSS and assess its effectiveness in managing a wide medical range of patients. Five different patient cases were identified for analysis. The SCDSS was used to produce draft electronic specialist consultations, which were then compared to the original specialists’ consultations. It was found that the SCDSS-generated consults were of better quality for a number of reasons discussed herein. SCDSSs have great promise for their use in the clinical environment of smart cities. Valuable insights into the integration and use of situated clinical decision support systems are highlighted and suggestions for future research are given.</p>",

Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services.

RFID technology is a non-contact identification technology that does not require direct eyesight to the target object. It is cheap and reliable, but its coverage zone is limited. ZigBee is another communication technology, which has a larger coverage and can also be used as an automatic identification technology with the benefits of lower power consumption.

abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

Liu, Jun Luo, Ooi Keng-Boon Abstract: Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an internet of things technology that provides many benefits to the healthcare industry's supply chain. However, a challenge faced by healthcare industry is the limited adoption and use of RFID by physicians and nurses. This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding the acceptance of RFID in the healthcare industry.

In parallel, a growing number of personal and portable devices, like smartphones and tablet computers, are becoming capable of taking the role of health gateway, that is, a data collector for the sensor PHDs. However, as the number of PHDs increase, the number of other peripherals connected in PAN also increases. Therefore, PHDs are now competing for medium access with other devices, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of health applications in the PAN. In this article we present a reference architecture to prioritize PHD connections based on their state and requirements, creating a healthcare Smart Gateway. Healthcare context information is extracted by observing the traffic through the gateway. A standard-based approach was used to identify health traffic based on ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards. A reference implementation was developed showing the relevance of the problem and how the proposed architecture can assist in the prioritization. The reference Smart Gateway solution was integrated with a Connected Health System for the Internet of Things, validating its use in a real case scenario.",

A body sensor network (BSN) is a type of network for Internet of Things. A BSN typically consists of tens (dozens) of biosensor nodes distributed on/in the human body, and these autonomous nodes can form a wireless network to measure physiological signals and execute intelligent treatment automatically. BSNs have wide application prospects in intelligent healthcare. Because physiological signals measured and processed by BSNs involve patient privacy, security mechanisms must be developed to secure BSNs, and therefore the adoption of available key negotiation protocols is fundamental. Due to stringently limited operation resources, BSNs require these protocols to be highly energy efficient. Recent development has discovered that certain physiological signals can be used for efficiently negotiating common keys among biosensor nodes. These signals and fuzzy technology are used to design lightweight key negotiation protocols, and many solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we explore and classify these solutions, and evaluate their performance by analyzing their merits and drawbacks. Finally, we present open research issues that should be solved in the future.",

Steinberg, Petar Kassal, Irena Kerekovic, Ivana Murkovic Steinberg Abstract: Wireless chemical sensors are used as analytical devices in homeland defence, home-based healthcare, food logistics and more generally for the Sensor Internet of Things (SIoT). Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system - the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) - and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the 'missing link' in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R.sup.2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things.

During the WCE procedure, a significant amount of redundant video data is generated, the transmission of which to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists securely for analysis is challenging as well as wastage of several resources including energy, memory, computation, and bandwidth. In addition to this, it is inherently difficult and time consuming for gastroenterologists to analyze this huge volume of gastrointestinal video data for desired contents. To surmount these issues, we propose a secure video summarization framework for outdoor patients going through WCE procedure. In the proposed system, keyframes are extracted using a light-weighted video summarization scheme, making it more suitable for WCE. Next, a cryptosystem is presented for security of extracted keyframes based on 2D Zaslavsky chaotic map. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed cryptosystem in terms of robustness and high-level security compared to other recent image encryption schemes during dissemination of important keyframes to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists for personalized WCE.",

In this paper we develop effective, scalable, and realistic data collection and upload solutions using mobile data collectors in community IoT systems. Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30%–60% improvement in overall data utility, 30% reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability.",

With advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are benchmarked and future prospects are provided.",

Firstly, a nonlinear Markov process is derived from a large number of big networks with weak interactions, where each big network is described as a continuous-time block-structured Markov process. Secondly, some effective algorithms are given for computing the fixed points of the nonlinear Markov process by means of the UL-type RG-factorization. Finally, the Birkhoff center, the locally stable fixed points, the Lyapunov functions and the relative entropy are developed to analyze stability or metastability of the system of weakly interacting big networks, and several interesting open problems are proposed with detailed interpretation.

In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals.

In this study, micromachined hotplate-based CO 2 sensors were fabricated and their characteristics were investigated. The sensors have La 2 O 3 /SnO 2 stacked layers as a sensing material and Pt interdigitated electrodes. A CO 2 response of 2.9 for a CO 2 concentration of 1000 ppm was obtained at 350 °C with low power consumption (approximately 17 mW). A relatively large response was obtained compared with previous studies even though a compact sputtered-SnO 2 film was used. This high response was speculated to be due to a significant contribution of the resistance component near the electrode.

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm.

These platforms are comprised of a network of wireless sensors to monitor several physical and physiological quantities. For instance, long-term monitoring of brain activities using wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors is widely exploited in the clinical diagnosis of epileptic seizures and sleeping disorders. However, the deployment of such platforms is challenged by the high power consumption and system complexity. Energy efficiency can be achieved by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well-designed sensing matrices. Moreover, system complexity can be optimized by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of a CS-based multichannel EEG monitoring. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multichannel EEG using subspace pursuit (SP) algorithm as well as a designed sparsifying basis in order to improve the reconstruction quality.

abstract = "Personal e-healthcare service is growing significantly. A large number of personal e-health measuring and monitoring devices are now in the market. However, to achieve better health outcome, various devices or services need to work together. This coordination among services remains challenge, due to their variations and complexities. To address this issue, we have proposed an ontology-based framework for interactive self-assessment of RESTful e-health services. Unlike existing e-health service frameworks where they had tightly coupling between services, as well as their data schemas were difficult to change and extend in the future. In our work, the loosely coupling among services and flexibility of each service are achieved through the design and implementation based on HYDRA vocabulary and REST principles. We have implemented clinical knowledge through the combination of OWL-DL and SPARQL rules. All of these services evolve independently; their interfaces are based on REST principles, especially HATEOAS constraints. We have demonstrated how to apply our framework for interactive self-assessment in e-health applications. We have shown that it allows the medical knowledge to drive the system workflow according to the event-driven principles. New data schema can be maintained during run-time. This is the essential feature to support arriving of IoT (Internet of Things) based medical devices, which have their own data schema and evolve overtime.",

CPS engineering promises to impact system condition monitoring for a diverse range of fields from healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation to aerospace and warfare. CPS for environment monitoring applications completely transforms human-to-human, human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions with the use of Internet Cloud. A recent trend is to gain assistance from mergers between virtual networking and physical actuation to reliably perform all conventional and complex sensing and communication tasks. Oil and gas pipeline monitoring provides a novel example of the benefits of CPS, providing a reliable remote monitoring platform to leverage environment, strategic and economic benefits. In this paper, we evaluate the applications and technical requirements for seamlessly integrating CPS with sensor network plane from a reliability perspective and review the strategies for communicating information between remote monitoring sites and the widely deployed sensor nodes. Related challenges and issues in network architecture design and relevant protocols are also provided with classification. This is supported by a case study on implementing reliable monitoring of oil and gas pipeline installations. Network parameters like node-discovery, node-mobility, data security, link connectivity, data aggregation, information knowledge discovery and quality of service provisioning have been reviewed.",

abstract = "  Issue Title: Special Issue on 2013 International Conference on Identification, Information and Knowledge in the Internet of Things Healthcare systems have made a dramatic shift towards ubiquitous monitoring in the recent past. The reasons for such a change have been ease of timely diagnosis, convenience and comfort of clinical treatments. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are mainly characterized by deployment of biomedical sensors around human body which transmit vital signs measurements about the health status of the patient. Unfortunately, the huge traffic load of clinical data and limited resources of biomedical sensors make the efficiency of long-term operations almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to make significant advances in sensor's energy saving. Our idea is to reduce the activities of some sensors depending on the relevance between the data they measure and the diseases to detect. This paper shows how to extend the lifetime of medical WBANs by appropriately taking benefit of correlation between the knowledge about the disease and sensing data to drive the best scheduling of the medical sensors. For that, the theoretical framework of an economic approach, i.e., network utility maximization, is developed for sensor scheduling under operations cost constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and information gain is then proposed. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy saving vs latency in disease detection.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms. Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems. By carefully analyzing the spatiotemporal workload characteristics of the NMPC problems, we propose the design of an efficient NoC architecture.

abstract = "<p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected things that are uniquely addressable, via standard communication protocols. The use of IoT for continuous monitoring of public health is being rapidly adopted by various countries while generating a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse high-velocity data. Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.</p></p>",

abstract = "With the rapid development of device-to-device and machine-to-machine communication, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications, such as intelligent transportation systems, smart e-healthcare, and smart education. In these applications, various devices can be identified using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags, which can be used for transferring the collected data to other local or remote objects at various geographical locations. However, for automatic reading of data accumulated in an RFID-tag embedded in an object/device, authentication is required at various stages for the aforementioned applications. In RFID-based systems for smart applications, an RFID-tag may be operated from several meters distance and it does not require to be put within direct line-of-sight of the reader like a barcode system. Therefore, the traditional barcode system will be replaced by the RFID authentication system in near future since in the later, technology reading of a large amount of data within short span is possible. However, in existing RFID-based authentication systems, an adversary may access the RFID-tag information, which can compromise the privacy and it may also create forgery problems. In addition, RFID-based authentication is suffering from heavy computation burden since an RFID-tag has very limited computation capability. To address these issues, lots of anonymous RFID-based authentication schemes have been designed using lightweight cryptographic tools, e.g., the hash function and symmetric key encryption. However, all these schemes failed to achieve known security and functionality requirements. Motivated by the above-mentioned issues, in this paper, we have put forwarded an RFID-based authentication architecture for distributed IoT (Internet of Things) applications suitable for the future smart city environments. Subsequently, we have put forwarded a lightweight RFID-based authentication scheme to provide reasonable execution time compared to existing schemes. Our scheme provides forward secrecy, anonymity and untraceability of RFID-tag, and secure localization. In summary, the proposed scheme can be used in wide range of applications in smart city environments. •New RFID-based authentication scheme is designed for IoT-based infrastructure in smart city environment.•The proposed scheme has been verified with respect to various parameters where its performance was found superior than the other existing schemes of its category.•The designed scheme can be used for future smart city environment for preserving security at various levels.",

Compared to Everything-as-a-Service (*aaS), resources are categorized into computational, consumed, and produced, have trackable lifecycles as per their respective category, and are customized in order to consider the characteristics of future resource-based collaborative applications to develop. From a capacity perspective, a computational resource processes data, a produced resource abstracts data, and a consumed resource captures data. Along with their capacities, resources expose methods that other resources and/or applications’ stakeholders call. The proper call of methods is ensured through restrictions like limited and non-shareable. This paper exemplifies the *aaR paradigm with a case study that revolves around the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the healthcare domain. The case study is implemented in a RESTful fashion along with some standard Web technologies and protocols. The evaluation of IoTR4HealthCare system is benchmarked against two existing systems using cost and latency criteria.",

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

In order to encourage IoT market participation, reliable evidence guaranteeing market success needs to be presented to investors and enterprises. Particularly, the most promising domain in IoT needs to be discovered as a killer application to primarily invest in and develop, so that it can pioneer the IoT market. This study proposes an AHP model for assessing the viability of IoT applications, which consists of 11 technology, market, and regulation factors. The model was applied to assess and compare the prospect of three IoT applications — i.e. IoT healthcare, IoT logistics, and IoT energy management, inviting the perception of 31 ICT experts. The results showed that IoT logistics is the most promising IoT application, due to its strong market potential. IoT healthcare is perceived to have strength in wide consumer market demand, but reliability issues and regulation issues were posed. Meanwhile, IoT energy management showed strengths only in governmental support. The results also imply that it would be wiser for the government to focus on eliminating regulatory bottlenecks. •A criteria model for assessing the viability of IoT applications was proposed.•IoT logistics showed strong market potential as B2B application.•IoT healthcare needs to overcome reliability and regulation issues.•IoT energy management has strength only in governmental support.•The government needs to focus on eliminating regulatory bottlenecks.",

abstract = "Healthcare concerns have become diverse, ranging from acute and chronic conditions to lifestyle, wellbeing and the prevention of illness. Increasingly, individuals are taking responsibility for monitoring their own conditions. Healthcare technologies are increasingly used not only for administration, but also in specialist treatments and many forms of monitoring, including when a person is mobile. As well as formal interactions with professional carers and results from specialist procedures, care may involve ad hoc interactions with an individual’s community. Together, these yield a wealth of data relevant in different contexts. Unfortunately, many existing healthcare systems are inflexible, single-purpose, and self-contained, so that we cannot fully realise their potential. We believe that a framework for flexible interoperability of healthcare-relevant components is crucial, in a time of increasing need from an ageing population. We present a vision of . To achieve this we believe that the application logic embodied in components should be separated from the policy that specifies where and how they should be used—which may be in ways not contemplated by their original designers. Middleware should therefore provide a framework that supports not only traditional communication among components but also dynamic reconfiguration of components in response to circumstances that arise, with the management and enforcement of high-level policy integrated with the middleware. By this means, functionality for patients, carers and health administrators can be customised and provided as, when and where required. This paper explores middleware requirements and challenges arising from technology- and population-driven developments in healthcare provision. We describe the specific requirements that middleware must address, and present some practical steps towards addressing these from the initial stages of a middleware (SBUS).",

We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user&#x2019;s goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.",

Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

abstract = "<p>The booming in cloud and IoT technologies has accelerated the growth of healthcare system. The IoT devices monitor the patient's health, and upload collected data as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to the cloud for storage and sharing. Outsourcing EMRs to the cloud introduce new security and privacy challenges. In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture ensuring security and privacy for the outsourced health records. The proposed model uses partially ordered set (POSET) for constructing the group based access structure and Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to provide fine-grained EMR access control. The modified group based CP-ABE (G-CP-ABE) minimizes the computational overhead by reducing the number of leaf nodes in the access tree. Also, the proposed G-CP-ABE framework merges symmetric encryption and CP-ABE scheme to minimize the overall encryption time. As a result, G-CP-ABE can be used to monitor health conditions even from a resource constrained IoT device. The performance analysis shows the efficiency of the proposed model, making it suitable for practical use.</p>",

However, there is no clear approach to modeling these systems and envisioning their capabilities at the design time. Therefore, the process of designing these systems is ad hoc and its real impact is evaluated once the solution is already implemented, which is risky and expensive. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uses human-centric wireless sensor networks to specify and evaluate models of IoT-based systems at the time of design, avoiding the need to spend time and effort on early implementations of immature designs. It allows designers to focus on the system design, leaving the implementation decisions for a next phase. The article illustrates the usefulness of this proposal through a running example, showing the design of an IoT-based solution to support the first responses during medium-sized or large urban incidents. The case study used in the proposal evaluation is based on a real train crash. The proposed modeling approach can be used to design IoT-based systems for other application scenarios, e.g., to support security operatives or monitor chronic patients in their homes.",

These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

Both systems enable researchers to develop healthcare systems with additional intelligence as well as prediction capabilities both for lifestyle and in hospitals. It offers as much persistence as a platform to ubiquitous healthcare by using wearable sensors to transfer the information over servers, smartphones, and other smart devices in the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS). Security is a challenging issue in TMIS, and resourceful access to health care services requires user verification and confidentiality. Existing schemes lack in ensuring reliable prescription safety along with authentication. This research presents a Secure Authentication and Prescription Safety (SAPS) protocol to ensure secure communication between the patient, doctor/nurse, and the trusted server. The proposed procedure relies upon the efficient elliptic curve cryptosystem which can generate a symmetric secure key to ensure secure data exchange between patients and physicians after successful authentication of participants individually. A trusted server is involved for mutual authentication between parties and then generates a common key after completing the validation process. Moreover, the scheme is verified by doing formal modeling using Rubin Logic and validated using simulations in NS-2.35. We have analyzed the SAPS against security attacks, and then performance analysis is elucidated. Results prove the dominance of SAPS over preliminaries regarding mutual authentication, message integrity, freshness, and session key management and attack prevention.</p>",

Given the enormous requirements that emerge in such a setting—both in terms of data and energy—data aggregation appears as a key element in reducing the amount of traffic in wireless sensor networks and achieving energy conservation. Probabilistic frameworks have been introduced as operational efficient and performance effective solutions for data aggregation in distributed sensor networks. In this work, we introduce an overall optimization approach that improves and complements such frameworks towards identifying the optimal probability for a node to aggregate packets as well as the optimal aggregation period that a node should wait for performing aggregation, so as to minimize the overall energy consumption, while satisfying certain imposed delay constraints. Primal dual decomposition is employed to solve the corresponding optimization problem while simulation results demonstrate the operational efficiency of the proposed approach under different traffic and topology scenarios.</p>",

Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94&#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75&#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.8.",

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.",

In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT.",

abstract = "Objectives A number of technologies can reduce overall costs for the prevention or management of chronic illnesses. These include devices that constantly monitor health indicators, devices that auto-administer therapies, or devices that track real-time health data when a patient self-administers a therapy. Because they have increased access to high-speed Internet and smartphones, many patients have started to use mobile applications (apps) to manage various health needs. These devices and mobile apps are now increasingly used and integrated with telemedicine and telehealth via the medical Internet of Things (mIoT). This paper reviews mIoT and big data in healthcare fields. Methods mIoT is a critical piece of the digital transformation of healthcare, as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences. Results Wearables and mobile apps today support fitness, health education, symptom tracking, and collaborative disease management and care coordination. All those platform analytics can raise the relevancy of data interpretations, reducing the amount of time that end users spend piecing together data outputs. Insights gained from big data analysis will drive the digital disruption of the healthcare world, business processes and real-time decision-making. Conclusions A new category of {"}personalised preventative health coaches{"} (Digital Health Advisors) will emerge. These workers will possess the skills and the ability to interpret and understand health and well-being data. They will help their clients avoid chronic and diet-related illness, improve cognitive function, achieve improved mental health and achieve improved lifestyles overall.

This protocol is supposed to work in the networks with high traffic because multiple sources try to send their packets to a destination at the same time, which is a typical scenario in IoT applications for remote healthcare monitoring. For selecting the next hop node, the algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of three factors: signal to interference and noise ratio of the link, the survivability factor the path from the next hop node to the destination, and the congestion level at the next hop node. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol works better concerning the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and the remaining energy level of the nodes.

Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naive, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers' data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework's architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework's design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) holds big promises for healthcare, especially in proactive personal eHealth. Prediction of symptomatic crises in chronic diseases in the IoT scenario leads to the deployment of ambulatory monitoring systems. These systems place a major concern in the amount of data to be processed and the intelligent management of the energy consumption. The huge amount of data generated for these systems require high computing capabilities only available in Data Centers. This paper presents a real case of prediction in the eHealth scenario, devoted to neurological disorders. The presented case study focuses on the migraine headache, a disease that affects around 15% of the European population. This paper extrapolates results from real data and simulations in a study where migraine patients are monitored using an unobtrusive Wireless Body Sensor Network. Low-power techniques are applied in monitorization nodes. Techniques such us: on-node signal processing and radio policies to make node’s autonomy longer and save energy, have been applied. Workload balancing policies are carried out in the coordinator nodes and Data Centers to reduce the computational burden in these facilities and minimize its energy consumption. Our results draw average savings of € 288 million in this eHealth scenario applied only to 2% of European migraine sufferers; in addition to savings of € 1272 million due to the benefits of the migraine prediction. •A real IoT eHealth scenario for and prediction of the migraine disease is shown.•Energy efficiency techniques in every level of the motorization network.•Low-power techniques in the radio and data processing in the sensing nodes.•Workload balancing policies are carried out in coordinator nodes and Data Centers.•The results show the energetic and economic benefits of the energy policies applied.",

However, before finding wide applications, EHR systems have to tackle privacy and efficiency challenges. For one thing, the confidentiality of EHRs is one of most important issues concerned by patients. For another, wearable devices in mobile cloud computing are often resource-constrained to some extent. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme which is proven secure in the standard model under the decisional parallel bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption. In the proposed scheme, an EHR owner can generate offline ciphertexts before knowing EHR data and access policies, which performs a majority of computation tasks. Furthermore, the online phase can rapidly assemble the final ciphertexts when EHR data and access policies become known. Our EHR access control scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes. Extensive performance comparisons and simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is very suitable for mobile cloud computing. •We propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme.•Our scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes.•Our scheme is proven secure and it is suitable for mobile cloud computing.",

Traditional approaches to combat the ZikaV outbreak are not effective for detection and control. The aim of this study is to propose a cloud-based system to prevent and control the spread of Zika virus disease using integration of mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT). Methods: A Naive Bayesian Network (NBN) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users, and Google Maps Web service is used to provide the geographic positioning system (GPS)-based risk assessment to prevent the outbreak. It is used to represent each ZikaV infected user, mosquito-dense sites, and breeding sites on the Google map that helps the government healthcare authorities to control such risk-prone areas effectively and efficiently. Results: The performance and accuracy of the proposed system are evaluated using dataset for 2 million users. Our system provides high accuracy for initial diagnosis of different users according to their symptoms and appropriate GPS-based risk assessment. Conclusions: The cloud-based proposed system contributed to the accurate NBN-based classification of infected users and accurate identification of risk-prone areas using Google Maps.",

Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (MIPv6) and its variants do not consider this situation. Consequently, as a constrained device moves around different wireless networks, its Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity may be frequently disrupted and power can be drained rapidly. This can result in the loss of important sensing data or a large delay for time-critical IoT services such as healthcare monitoring and disaster management. This paper presents a reliable mobility management mechanism in Internet of Things environments with lossy low-power constrained device and network characteristics. The idea is to use the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) retransmission mechanism to achieve both reliability and simplicity for reliable IoT mobility management. Detailed architecture, algorithms, and message extensions for reliable mobility management are presented. Finally, performance is evaluated using both mathematical analysis and simulation.",

abstract = "In recent years, with the increase in degenerative diseases and the aging population in advanced countries, demands for medical care of older or solitary people have increased continually in hospitals and healthcare institutions. Applying wireless sensor networks for the IoT-based telemedicine system enables doctors, caregivers or families to monitor patients' physiological conditions at anytime and anyplace according to the acquired information. However, transmitting physiological data through the Internet concerns the personal privacy of patients. Therefore, before users can access medical care services in IoT-based medical care system, they must be authenticated. Typically, user authentication and data encryption are most critical for securing network communications over a public channel between two or more participants. In 2016, Liu and Chung proposed a bilinear pairing-based password authentication scheme for wireless healthcare sensor networks. They claimed their authentication scheme cannot only secure sensor data transmission, but also resist various well-known security attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that Liu-Chung's scheme has some security weaknesses, and we further present an improved secure authentication and data encryption scheme for the IoT-based medical care system, which can provide user anonymity and prevent the security threats of replay and password/sensed data disclosure attacks. Moreover, we modify the authentication process to reduce redundancy in protocol design, and the proposed scheme is more efficient in performance compared with previous related schemes. Finally, the proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under ECDHP.",

Using the model, we analyze the synergistic effect of the functional requirements (data collection from the human body and transferring it to the top level) and non-functional requirements (trade-offs between energy-security-environmental factors, treated as Quality-of-Service (QoS)). We use feature models to represent the requirements at the earliest stage for the analysis and describe a model-driven methodology to design the possible BAN applications. Firstly, we specify the requirements as the problem domain (PD) variability model for the BAN applications. Next, we introduce the generative technology (meta-programming as the solution domain (SD)) and the mapping procedure to map the PD feature-based variability model onto the SD feature model. Finally, we create an executable meta-specification that represents the BAN functionality to describe the variability of the problem domain though transformations. The meta-specification (along with the meta-language processor) is a software generator for multiple BAN-oriented applications. We validate the methodology with experiments and a case study to generate a family of programs for the BAN sensor controllers. This enables to obtain the adequate measure of QoS efficiently through the interactive adjustment of the meta-parameter values and re-generation process for the concrete BAN application.</p>",

In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient’s health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient.

Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program.

Firstly, we show that the differentiated channel access of IEEE 802.11e cannot effectively assure medical-grade QoS because of priority inversion. To resolve this problem, we propose an efficient channel access algorithm. The proposed algorithm adjusts arbitrary inter-frame space (AIFS) in the IEEE 802.11e protocol depending on the QoS measurement of medical traffic, to provide differentiated near-absolute priority for medical traffic. In addition, based on rigorous capacity analysis, we propose an admission control scheme that can avoid performance degradation due to network overload. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed mechanism strictly assures the medical-grade QoS and improves the throughput of low-priority traffic by more than several times compared to the conventional IEEE 802.11e.",

It represents an urban model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city.

abstract = "Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness. •An energy management scheme for sustainability of cloud data centers in the edge cloud environment is presented.•Support vector machine is used for designing workload classification scheme in edge–cloud environment.•SDN based model is designed to deal with the issues of congestion at the network during data transmission.",

Each student with autism comes with her or his own unique needs and an array of behaviors and habits that can be severe and which interfere with everyday tasks. Autism is associated with intellectual disability, impairments in social skills, and physical health issues such as sleep and abdominal disturbances. We have designed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) framework named WearSense that leverages the sensing capabilities of modern smartwatches to detect stereotypic behaviors in children with autism. In this work, we present a study that used the inbuilt accelerometer of a smartwatch to detect three behaviors, including hand flapping, painting, and sibbing that are commonly observed in children with autism. In this feasibility study, we recruited 14 subjects to record the accelerometer data from the smartwatch worn on the wrist. The processing part extracts 34 different features in each dimension of the three-axis accelerometer, resulting in 102 features. Using and comparing various classification techniques revealed that an ensemble of 40 decision trees has the best accuracy of around 94.6%. This accuracy shows the quality of the data collected from the smartwatch and feature extraction methods used in this study. The recognition of these behaviors by using a smartwatch would be helpful in monitoring individuals with autistic behaviors, since the smartwatch can send the data to the cloud for comprehensive analysis and also to help parents, caregivers, and clinicians make informed decisions.",

abstract = "Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application’s interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

DPHK predicts and sends predicted data at one time instead of sending the triggered data of these sensor nodes which people is going to pass in several times. Firstly, our system learns the knowledge of transition probability among sensor nodes from the historical binary motion data through data mining. Secondly, it stores the corresponding knowledge in each sensor node based on a special storage mechanism. Thirdly, each sensor node applies HMM (hidden Markov model) algorithm to predict the sensor node locations people will arrive at according to the receivedmessage. At last, these sensor nodes send their triggered data and the predicted data to the sink node. The significances of DPHK are as follows: (a) the procedure of DPHK is distributed (b) it effectively reduces the connection between sensor nodes and sink node. The time complexities of the proposed algorithms are analyzed and the performance is evaluated by some designed experiments in a smart environment.

Vishvakarma (1) Keywords: object detection; object tracking; quadtree; macroblock resizing; monocular camera; directional vector pixel Abstract: In this paper, a high speed, reliable, low memory demanding and precise object detection and tracking algorithm is proposed. The proposed work uses a macroblock of rectangular shape, which is placed in the very first frame of the video to detect and track a single moving object using monocular camera. The macroblocks are positioned in the field of view (FOV) of camera where the probability of occurrence of object is high. After placing macroblocks, a threshold value is examined to detect the presence of objects in the selected macroblocks. Afterwards, a quadtree approach is used to minimize the bounding box and to reduce the pixelation. A tracking algorithm is proposed which illustrates a unique method to find the moving directional vectors. The proposed method is based on macroblock resizing, which demonstrates an accuracy rate of 98.5% with low memory utilization.

In 1945, when he was head of the power tube division at Raytheon, Spencer became the first to investigate why a candy bar had melted in his pocket while he was testing a magnetron tube. Before long, Raytheon had a patent on the first microwave, the Radarange, which weighed 750 pounds and sold as a commercial cooker for $2,000 to $3,000 to restaurants, ocean liners and passenger trains as a way to conveniently provide warm meals. According to Ryan McKillen, software engineer at Uber, they had to write lots of JavaScript and Python and build their dispatch systems on Node.js and Redis. Information Technology and Innovation Foundation President Robert D. Atkinson says that his organization has seen dramatic progress in scientific and technological innovation since their organization was founded in 2006. In a recent report on Restoring Investment in America’s Economy, he observed that 10 years ago, there was little experience with 3D printing, drones, deep-learning computing systems, big-data analytics, or the Internet of Things (IoT).

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient’s emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. Finally, we outline our prototype which runs on multiple computing platforms and show results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

Recently, the evidence theory and its derivates approaches began to take place in the fields of activity recognition in these smart systems. However, these approaches are generally inconsistent with the probability calculus due to the lower and upper probability bounds considering the combined evidences. To overcome these challenges and to get more precisely the reconcilement between the evidence theory with the frequentist approach of probability calculus, this work proposes a new methodology for combining beliefs, addressing some of the disadvantages exhibited by the evidence theory and its derivatives. This methodology merges the non-normalized conjunctive and the majority rules. The proposed rule is evaluated in numerical simulation case studies involving the activity recognition in a smart home environment.

They include healthcare monitoring, industrial application, smart grid, home automation, and many energy-critical application suffered from limited resources. In response, many studies have proposed energy efficient solutions, however, they may waste energy as ever. It is because they do not consider the contentions in multi-coordinator environments then the frequent packet collisions are followed by retransmission which consumed unnecessary energy. In this respect, we proposed a new and simply implementable contention mitigation scheme to enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes by reducing the contention degree among neighboring coordinators. In the proposed scheme, the coordinators recognize the network state by exchanging their information with each other. It leads that the coordinators isolate the superframe duration by staggering own beacon transmission. It can alleviate significant contentions among burst packets at the beginning of the superframe. Therefore, the proposed scheme reduces a lot of unnecessary wasted energy in the process of redundant retransmission. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing energy efficient solutions with regard to the network performance.",

Among other challenges, these networks cover the deployment and interaction of small devices with constrained capabilities and Internet protocol (IP)-based networking connectivity. These constrained devices usually require connection to the Internet to exchange information (e.g., management or sensing data) or access network services. However, only authenticated and authorized devices can, in general, establish this connection. The so-called authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) services are in charge of performing these tasks on the Internet. Thus, it is necessary to deploy protocols that allow constrained devices to verify their credentials against AAA infrastructures. The Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) has been standardized by the Internet engineering task force (IETF) to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides flexible authentication upon the presence of AAA. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first deep study of the feasibility of EAP/PANA for network access control in constrained devices. We provide light-weight versions and implementations of these protocols to fit them into constrained devices. These versions have been designed to reduce the impact in standard specifications. The goal of this work is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of EAP/PANA in IoT devices; (2) to provide the scientific community with the first light-weight interoperable implementation of EAP/PANA for constrained devices in the Contiki operating system (Contiki OS), called PANATIKI.

Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay.",

For predictive purpose, the proposed framework indulges the utilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which is comprised of three phases namely, monitor, learn, and predict. In addition to this, the presented framework is supported by a mathematical foundation to predict probabilistic vulnerability, in terms of Probabilistic State of Vulnerability (PSoV). In order to determine the validity and applicability of the proposed framework, experiments were performed where 5 people with different attributes are monitored for 14 days using numerous smart sensors. Results, upon comparison with various state-of-the-art techniques, depict that the proposed system is superior in performance and is highly effective in delivering healthcare services during workouts.",

abstract = "Wireless chemical sensors are used as analytical devices in homeland defence, home-based healthcare, food logistics and more generally for the Sensor Internet of Things (SIoT). Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system – the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) – and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the ‘missing link’ in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things. •Credit-card size mobile/wearable potentiostat with wireless interface.•Inputs designed for amperometric sensors and enzyme-based biosensors.•Wireless RFID/NFC output for communication with Smartphone, tablet or PC.•Evaluation with solution-based redox couple and enzymatic glucose test-strips.",

The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics. •Massive IoT multimedia flows must be handled to support efficient cloud services.•IoT multimedia applications are expected to request common content.•A cross-layer multimedia SDN-oriented session control is proposed.•Proposed solution improves delay, jitter, throughput, SSIM and VQM.",

abstract = "The development of internet of things and the related sensor technology have been a key driving force for the rapid development of industry and information technology. The requirement of wireless, sustainable and independent operation is becoming increasingly important for sensor networks that currently could include thousands even to millions of sensor nodes with different functionalities. For these purposes, developing technologies of self-powered sensors that can utilize the ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves is highly desirable and mandatory. The realization of self-powered sensors generally has two approaches: the first approach is to develop environmental energy harvesting devices for driving the traditional sensors; the other is to develop a new category of sensors – self-powered active sensors – that can actively generate electrical signal itself as a response to a stimulation/triggering from the ambient environment. The recent invention and intensive development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new technology for mechanical energy harvesting can be utilized as self-powered active mechanical sensors, because the parameters (magnitude, frequency, number of periods, etc.) of the generated electrical signal are directly determined by input mechanical behaviors. In this review paper, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including the four basic working modes. Then, the most updated progress of developing TENGs as self-powered active sensors is reviewed. TENGs with different working modes and rationally designed structures have been developed as self-powered active sensors for a variety of mechanical motions, including pressure change, physical touching, vibrations, acoustic waves, linear displacement, rotation, tracking of moving objects, and acceleration detection. Through combining the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the detection of both static and dynamic processes has been enabled. The integration of individual sensor elements into arrays or matrixes helps to realize the mapping or parallel detection for multiple points. On the other hand, the relationship between the amplitude of TENG-generated electrical signal and the chemical state of its triboelectric surface enables TENGs to function as self-powered active chemical sensors. Through continuous research on the TENG-based self-powered active sensors in the coming years to further improve the sensitivity and realize the self-powered operation for the entire sensor node systems, they will soon have broad applications in touch screens, electronic skins, healthcare, environmental/infrastructure monitoring, national security, and more. •The fundamental of triboelectric nanogenerators as the basis of serving as self-powered active sensors.•Triboelectric-nanogenerator-based self-powered active sensors for different types of mechanical motions, chemical detection and environmental monitoring.•An insightful perspective for the future research.",

This novel view has opened the Web services to a variety of devices especially to tiny and resource-constrained devices. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks belong to that kind of devices. Those networks have become one of the more promising technologies to take part in the Future Internet. However, the integration of Sensor and Actuator Networks into the Service Cloud is a hard challenge requiring specific new architectures and protocols. This paper presents a middleware approach addressing this important issue. A Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented Middleware (KASOM) for pervasive embedded networks is proposed.

In this sense, KASOM implements mechanisms and protocols which allow managing the knowledge generated in pervasive embedded networks in order to expose it to Internet users in a readable way. General functional requirements of embedded sensor and actuator platforms have been taken into account when designing KASOM, with special attention in energy consumption, memory and bandwidth. The KASOM evaluation and validation will be demonstrated through a real Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network deployment based on integral healthcare services in a sanatorium.

In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities.

In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system.

It's becoming more and more apparent that businesses are at risk of disintermediation from lack of understanding of data. Whoever harnesses the data controls the industry. Yet adding a radically diferent new capability to a well-established business is not easy. Even the most sophisticated well-established companies are running into many obstacles. Software is diferent. Software engineers have a loyalty to the software, not to the company they work for or the markets in which the software is used. With companies such as Google and Facebook setting the benchmark, employees expect to be treated diferently, with a fexible working environment and fast-rising stock options. This model does not ft the way the aerospace majors work, and so it's not surprising that key talent often walks out the door soon after an acquisition. The parent company's shareholders, in general, are interested in short-term performance. Persuading shareholders of an aerospace company to make a longterm bet on a loss-making software company on a multiple of fve or six times sales is not easy, but this level of multiple is commonplace in the high-tech world. What is more, software companies are usually at such an early stage that no one really knows where the technology will deliver the most business value. For example, one engine company invested in analytical software to predict engine problems only to fnd that the biggest market for this software was in healthcare.",

abstract = "Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients&#x2019; vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users&#x2019; sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users&#x2019; side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way&#x2014;which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users&#x2019; health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.",

They are viewed as a key enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous applications, like mobile healthcare, telemetry, or intelligent transport systems. We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network. We conclude that, in order for their use to the feasible in terms of a normal depletion time of a smartphone's battery, it is a good advice to maximize the collection of data necessary to be transmitted from nearby sensors, and maximize the intervals between transmissions. More research is required to devise energy efficient transmission methods that enable the use of smartphones as mobile gateways.",

We propose a universal model for bias-stress (BS)-induced instability in the inkjet-printed carbon nanotube (CNT) networks used in field-effect transistors (FETs). By combining two experimental methods, i.e., a comparison between air and vacuum BS tests and interface trap extraction, BS instability is explained regardless of either the BS polarity or ambient condition, using a single platform constituted by four key factors: OH− adsorption/desorption followed by a change in carrier concentration, electron concentration in CNT channel corroborated with H2O/O2 molecules in ambient, charge trapping/detrapping, and interface trap generation. Under negative BS (NBS), the negative threshold voltage shift (ΔVT) is dominated by OH− desorption, which is followed by hole trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. Under positive BS (PBS), the positive ΔVT is dominated by OH− adsorption, which is followed by electron trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. This instability is compensated by interface trap extraction; PBS instability is slightly more complicated than NBS instability. Furthermore, our model is verified using device simulation, which gives insights on how much each mechanism contributes to BS instability. Our result is potentially useful for the design of highly stable CNT-based flexible circuits in the Internet of Things wearable healthcare era.",

However, a host of ethical concerns are also raised that must be addressed. The inherent sensitivity of health-related data being generated and latent risks of Internet-enabled devices pose serious challenges. Users, already in a vulnerable position as patients, face a seemingly impossible task to retain control over their data due to the scale, scope and complexity of systems that create, aggregate, and analyse personal health data.

Smartphone, sensor devices, cellular communication, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recent technologies that provide new mobile location based services. Such services could help mobile tourists, i.e. tourist who is currently moving between various sites, to get innovative set of services which make their trip easier and safer. Designing efficient solutions that help tourists with chronic diseases to find an appropriate geographical route from a source to a tourism destination through a transportation network is crucial to healthcare systems. This paper proposes a new approach in generating geographical routes that are best served with close medical centers. Our approach, called Geographical Routing for Mobile Tourist (GRMT), selects a route that is best served with medical centers, and goes through the path that is as shortest as possible in regards with the distance. We have modeled and simulated the proposed approach using simulation program. Simulated experimental results show that GRMT allows tourists to select geographical routes that are served with the highest number of close medical centers although the selected route is slightly longer in distance. •An IoT architecture connecting a health-worrier tourist to nearby healthcare centers is introduced.•An approach to find a geographical route that is best served with healthcare centers is proposed.•An analytical model for weighing various available geographical routes is presented.•Routes weighing is based on closeness, speciality, and number of nearby healthcare centers.•The efficiency of the proposed approach in overcoming tourists travel constraints was evaluated via simulation.",

There is no literature related to patient follow-up that incorporates the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), use of WiFi, Internet, or portable devices for this purpose. Material and methods: This prospective observational study commenced in June 2011. Patients were prospectively offered to participate in the IoT study group, in which they received a WiFi scale (Withing, Paris) that provides instant WiFi data to the patient and surgeon. Other patients were admitted to the standard follow-up group at the outpatient clinic. A total of 33 patients were included in our study (ten in the IoT group). Results: Twelve patients did not have WiFi at home, ten lacked of computer knowledge, and seven preferred standard for follow-up. All patients underwent different surgical procedures. There were no complications. Excess weight loss (EWL) was similar in both groups. More than 90% of patients were satisfied. In the IoT group, patients considered it valuable in saving time, and considered seeing their evolution graphics extremely motivating. Conclusion: IoT technology can monitor medical parameters remotely and collect data. A WiFi scale can facilitate preoperative and follow-up. Standard follow-up in a classical outpatient clinic setting with the surgeon was preferred globally.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in several domains such as surveillance of civil infrastructure, smart grids, and smart healthcare are of utmost importance for our society and require dependable performance. Guaranteeing that application-specific dependability requirements are met is however still an open research challenge. The IoT indeed exposes highly resource-constrained computing devices to harsh environmental conditions (e.g., heat, mechanical shock, electromagnetic radiation) and physical attacks. Unfortunately, traditional methods to withstand these threats heavily rely on redundancy, a concept that is incompatible with the resource constraints of common IoT devices. In this article, we illustrate our efforts in providing methods and tools to predict, guarantee, and raise the level of dependability of the IoT. We first outline our contributions in the area of dependable wireless networking and describe a cost-effective solution allowing to guarantee that IoT applications meet specific performance requirements despite the challenging interaction of low-power wireless networks with their surrounding environment. We then argue that dependable networking alone is insufficient to guarantee the correct operation of a complex IoT system, and outline how we join different scientific disciplines in a long-term endeavor and work towards a coherent view of dependability. Die Anwendungen des Internets der Dinge (IoT – Internet of Things), wie z. B. die Überwachung von zivilen Infrastruktureinrichtungen, Smart Grids oder intelligente Gesundheitspflege, sind für unsere Gesellschaft von größter Bedeutung und erfordern eine hohe Verlässlichkeit des IoT. Die je nach Gebiet unterschiedlichen Anforderungen an die Zuverlässigkeit zu gewährleisten, stellt jedoch immer noch eine große Herausforderung für die Wissenschaft dar. Tatsächlich sind die eingesetzten Geräte und Computer rauen Umgebungsbedingungen (wie z. B. Hitze oder elektromagnetische Strahlung) sowie physischen Angriffen ausgesetzt. Herkömmliche Methoden diesen Bedrohungen stand zu halten, beruhen meist auf Redundanzen – einem Konzept, das mit den beschränkten Ressourcen gängiger IoT-Plattformen nicht umsetzbar ist. Im vorliegenden Beitrag zeigen die Autoren Methoden und Werkzeuge auf, um die Zuverlässigkeit des IoT zu erhöhen, besser vorhersagbar zu machen und letztlich Verlässlichkeitsgarantien abzugeben. Sie berichten zunächst über Erfahrungen im Bereich der zuverlässigen drahtlosen Vernetzung und beschreiben eine effiziente Lösung, um auch in anspruchsvollen Umgebungen mit ressourcenarmen IoT-Plattformen verlässlich kommunizieren zu können. Um ein verlässliches IoT zu konstruieren, genügt die alleinige Betrachtung der drahtlosen Vernetzung jedoch nicht. Die Autoren beschreiben daher einen ganzheitlichen interdisziplinären Ansatz, um alle relevanten Aspekte des IoT verlässlich zu gestalten.",

Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model. •A new architecture is proposed to store and process scalable sensor data.•MF-R architecture uses Apache Pig and Apache HBase to the sensor data.•GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing.•MapReduce based prediction model is proposed to predict the heart diseases.",

However, their heterogeneous integration with other electronic modules on a networked sensor node, such as silicon-based modulators and memories, is inherently challenging because of compatibility and integration issues. Here we report a novel paradigm for sensing modulators: a graphene field-effect transistor device that directly modulates a radio frequency (RF) electrical carrier signal when exposed to chemical agents, with a memory effect in its electrochemical history. We demonstrated the concept and implementation of this graphene-based sensing modulator through a frequency-modulation (FM) experiment conducted in a modulation cycle consisting of alternating phases of air exposure and ethanol or water treatment. In addition, we observed an analog memory effect in terms of the charge neutrality point of the graphene, V cnp , which strongly influences the FM results, and developed a calibration method using electrochemical gate-voltage pulse sequences. This graphene-based multifunctional device shows great potential for use in a simple, low-cost, and ultracompact nanomaterial-based nodal architecture to enable continuous, real-time event-based monitoring in pervasive healthcare IoTs, ubiquitous security systems, and other chemical/molecular/gas monitoring applications.",

Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with $M$ cognitive users and $N$ arms ( $M<N$ ). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into $M$ groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.",

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient&#x0027;s clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups.

However, almost all cloud-computing architectures including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are vulnerable to serious security issues. Similarly, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is vital to overcoming mobile limited storage and computing capabilities. MCC authentication and authorization issues must be provided on two levels: login password control and the environment from where the cloud is accessed. MCC has overcome the barrier of limited storage by providing remote storage but requires a strict security system that is responsible for retrievability, integrity, and seamless storage access. Elasticity and connectivity are also of major concern in MCC because delays and jitters cause degradation in the user experience. Cloud-computing architecture creates more challenges in maintaining security because of the liberty of users to choose any MCC architecture. Thus in this paper we discuss current cloud computing issues and future directions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

This multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study will compare the impact of intensive health guidance using IoT and conventional medical guidance on glucose control. It will be conducted in outpatients with type 2 diabetes for a period of 6 months. IoT devices to measure amount of daily activity, BW, and BP will be provided to IoT group patients. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) will provide appropriate feedback according to the data. Non-IoT control, patients will be given measurement devices that do not have a feedback function. The primary outcome is glycated hemoglobin at 6 months. The study has already enrolled 101 patients, 50 in the IoT group and 51 in the non-IoT group, at the two participating outpatient clinics. The baseline characteristics of two groups did not differ, except for triglycerides. This will be the first randomized, controlled study to evaluate IoT-dependent effects of intensive feedback from HCPs.

Continuous intensification of the multifaceted urban set-up is extensively challenged by real-time processing of data and smart decision capabilities. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a smart city architecture which is based on Big Data analytics. The proposed scheme is comprised of three modules: (1) data acquisition and aggregation module collects varied and diverse data interrelated to city services, (2) data computation and processing module performs normalization, filtration, processing and data analysis, and (3) application and decision module formulates decisions and initiates events. The proposed architecture is a generic solution for the smart urban planning and variety of datasets is analyzed to validate this architecture. In addition, we tested reliable datasets on Hadoop server to verify the threshold limit value (TLV) and the investigation demonstrates that the proposed scheme offer valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture.

In this study, a secure IoT-based smart home automation system was developed. To facilitate energy-efficient data encryption, a method namely Triangle Based Security Algorithm (TBSA) based on efficient key generation mechanism was proposed. The proposed TBSA in integration of the low power Wi-Fi were included in WSNs with the Internet to develop a novel IoT-based smart home which could provide secure data transmission among several associated sensor nodes in the network over a long converge range. The developed IoT based system has outstanding performance by fulfilling all the necessary security requirements.

The potential of IoT technologies and deployments has been already demonstrated in a number of different application areas, including transport, energy, safety and healthcare. However, despite the growing number of IoT deployments, the majority of IoT applications tend to be self-contained, thereby forming application silos. A lightweight data centric integration and combination of these silos presents several challenges that still need to be addressed. Indeed, the ability to combine and synthesize data streams and services from diverse IoT platforms and testbeds, holds the promise to increase the potentiality of smart applications in terms of size, scope and targeted business context. In this article, a proof-of-concept implementation that federates two different IoT experimentation facilities by means of semantic-based technologies will be described. The specification and design of the implemented system and information models will be described together with the practical details of the developments carried out and its integration with the existing IoT platforms supporting the aforementioned testbeds. Overall, the system described in this paper demonstrates that it is possible to open new horizons in the development of IoT applications and experiments at a global scale, that transcend the (silo) boundaries of individual deployments, based on the semantic interconnection and interoperability of diverse IoT platforms and testbeds.",

This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.",

abstract = "<p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm holds significant promises for remote health monitoring systems. Due to their life- or mission-critical nature, these systems need to provide a high level of availability and accuracy. On the one hand, centralized cloud-based IoT systems lack reliability, punctuality and availability (e.g., in case of slow or unreliable Internet connection), and on the other hand, fully outsourcing data analytics to the edge of the network can result in diminished level of accuracy and adaptability due to the limited computational capacity in edge nodes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a hierarchical computing architecture, HiCH, for IoT-based health monitoring systems. The core components of the proposed system are 1) a novel computing architecture suitable for hierarchical partitioning and execution of machine learning based data analytics, 2) a closed-loop management technique capable of autonomous system adjustments with respect to patient's condition. HiCH benefits from the features offered by both fog and cloud computing and introduces a tailored management methodology for healthcare IoT systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of HiCH via a comprehensive performance assessment and evaluation on a continuous remote health monitoring case study focusing on arrhythmia detection for patients suffering from CardioVascular Diseases (CVDs).</p></p>",

abstract = "<p> Purpose In view of the elderly caregiving service being in high demand nowadays, the purpose of this paper is to develop an intelligent e-healthcare system for the domestic care industry by using the Internet of Things (IoTs) and Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) approach. Design/methodology/approach The IoTs connected with the e-healthcare system collect real-time vital sign monitoring data for the e-healthcare system. The FARM approach helps to identify the hidden relationships between the data records in the e-healthcare system to support the elderly care management tasks. Findings To evaluate the proposed system and approach, a case study was carried out to identify the association between the specific collected demographic data, behavior data and the health measurements data in the e-healthcare system. It is found that the discovered rules are useful for the care management tasks in the elderly healthcare service. Originality/value Knowledge discovery in databases uses various data mining techniques and rule-based artificial intelligence algorithms. This paper demonstrates complete processes on how an e-healthcare system connected with IoTs can support the elderly care services via a data collection phase, data analysis phase and data reporting phase by using the FARM to evaluate the fuzzy sets of the data attributes. The caregivers can use the discovered rules for proactive decision support of healthcare services and to improve the overall service quality by enhancing the elderly healthcare service responsiveness. </p>",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is attracting considerable attention from the universities, industries, citizens and governments for applications, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring and smart buildings. IoT enables network connectivity between smart devices at all times, everywhere, and about everything. In this context, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role in increasing the ubiquity of networks with smart devices that are low-cost and easy to deploy. However, sensor nodes are restricted in terms of energy, processing and memory. Additionally, low-power radios are very sensitive to noise, interference and multipath distortions. In this context, this article proposes a routing protocol based on Routing by Energy and Link quality (REL) for IoT applications. To increase reliability and energy-efficiency, REL selects routes on the basis of a proposed end-to-end link quality estimator mechanism, residual energy and hop count. Furthermore, REL proposes an event-driven mechanism to provide load balancing and avoid the premature energy depletion of nodes/networks. Performance evaluations were carried out using simulation and testbed experiments to show the impact and benefits of REL in small and large-scale networks. The results show that REL increases the network lifetime and services availability, as well as the quality of service of IoT applications. It also provides an even distribution of scarce network resources and reduces the packet loss rate, compared with the performance of well-known protocols.",

abstract = "Population aging and increasing pressure on health systems are two issues that demand solutions. Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.",
