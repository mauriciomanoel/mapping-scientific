abstract = "Abstract Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.

Here, Raspberry Pi is used to build a low-cost biometric system. Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a credit-sized mini-computer with great capabilities similar to a PC. In this study it is used as a remote enrollment node. The application of Raspberry Pi and cloud computing has given a new direction of research into the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Using the biometric technology, a new system of IoT based biometrics is proposed. To maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet channel from \{RPi\} client to the cloud, cryptographic algorithms are applied like \{RSA\} and enhanced AES-256. The encrypted biometric information is stored on the cloud and the authentication can be done by Biometric service hosted on Azure cloud. Thus, this papers covers the following topics: attracting power of biometrics into the authentication services, biometrics leveraging the power of cloud, Raspberry Pi- a low-cost IoT device, enhanced AES-256 with Round structure and dynamic S-box generation and the new emerging trend of Internet-of-Things.

Shared economy applications such as Airbnb and Uber are well-known applications, but there are many other opportunities to share in the digital economy. With the recent interest in the Internet of Things and blockchain, the opportunity exists to create a myriad of sharing applications, e.g. peer-to-peer automatic payment mechanisms, foreign exchange platforms, digital rights management and cultural heritage to name but a few. While many types of shared economy scenarios are proliferating, few of them, so far, leverage the Internet of Things and blockchain as technologies to build distributed applications.

However, the number of advanced IoT-based continuous glucose monitoring systems is small and the existing systems have several limitations. In this paper we study feasibility of invasive and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system utilizing IoT based approach. We designed an IoT-based system architecture from a sensor device to a back-end system for presenting real-time glucose, body temperature and contextual data (i.e. environmental temperature) in graphical and human-readable forms to end-users such as patients and doctors. In addition, nRF communication protocol is customized for suiting to the glucose monitoring system and achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate energy consumption of the sensor device and design energy harvesting units for the device. Finally, the work provides many advanced services at a gateway level such as a push notification service for notifying patient and doctors in case of abnormal situations (i.e. too low or too high glucose level). The results show that our system is able to achieve continuous glucose monitoring remotely in real-time. In addition, the results reveal that a high level of energy efficiency can be achieved by applying the customized nRF component, the power management unit and the energy harvesting unit altogether in the sensor device.

Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art \{PPDA\} techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node.

The aim is to design cross-domain applications that compose and select most relevant services, which best match user requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model for smart objects description and users request resolution using ontological techniques combined with description logics. Such a model facilitates intelligent functions, including reasoning over service data and semantic interoperability enabling among devices. A case study for smart environment monitoring has been proposed to illustrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach. "

To meet this requirements, cyber-physical systems (CPS) are applied into the production process, aiming for interconnected and self-managing smart factories, which can incorporate external and internal conditions for the autonomous adaptation to gain optimized results. This is achieved through a bi-directional information flow between all important components such as machines, products, control programs and off-site assets. Therefore it is essential to standardize communication interfaces and enhance interoperability between \{CPS\} of all variations. This paper presents an approach to combine the specification of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the guidelines of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 (I4.0), thus obtaining a uniform structure for industrial CPS. Based on the recommended asset administration shell for I4.0-components, the required functionality is identified and allocated to different segments. The five main segments include the functionality for security, representation, communication to external CPS, communication to internal assets and a section for additional applications to enhance the capabilities. By using a standardized protocol for the configuration and representation based on the object memory model of the W3C, a significant interoperability between I4.0-components and conventional Internet-of-Things can be realized. The proposed structure is applied in a use case to simulate the adaptation and remote maintenance of a production robot. "

The concept of the Internet of Things and Services envisions physical devices and appliances to be used as easily as a web service and seamlessly integrated into networked applications with required functionality. Technologically this concept is clear, and several smart applications are currently under development (see e.g. iCore, Hydra, Confidence or IoT@Work projects). However, the business perspective of information as an asset in its own right remains an open issue. To handle this issue we apply an originally value-based requirement technique, e3-value, to model value creation and value exchange within an e-business network of multiple business actors. Using this approach the business activity can be reduced to its core elements, which in the simplest case comprise the value proposition, distribution channels and the customers of the company, explaining how a multi-actor network creates, distributes and consumes value by production of a good or providing a service.

It also provides support for application delivery in private, public, and hybrid approaches. The proposed platform is an extension of our Interactive Case-Based Flipped Learning Tool (ICBFLT), which has been developed based on current \{CBL\} practices. \{ICBFLT\} formulates summaries of \{CBL\} cases through synergy between students' and medical expert knowledge. The low cost and reduced size of sensor device, support of IoTs, and recent flipped learning advancements can enhance medical students' academic and practical experiences.

Nevertheless, in the literature, there is still a lack of suitable solutions for door-to-door routing supporting users from their origins to destinations and including the suggestion on where to park. On the other hand, in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario, a lot of novel information sources could be exploited to compute more efficient mobility solutions to be proposed to the user. As an example, parking availability data could be easily collected and exploited to provide multimodal routes (i.e. routes with at least two different means of transportation) that include suggestions on where to park and how to reach the final destination. In this paper, we describe a distributed IoT architecture towards the definition of a Mobility Recommender System. In particular, we focus on a car-based multimodality, where the user always starts a trip with his/her private vehicle, but he/she can also leave the car in Park-and-Ride infrastructures and reach the destination with public transportation. This type of routing on a wider search area will result to be more costly, and thus, it will particularly benefit from a parallel computational architectural solution. "

The knowledge of provenance is considered as a key component in establishing the above-mentioned issues. Most research, to a large extent, focus on requesting data, which is based on user inference and decision making, by utilising provenance information. However, little or nothing has been done regarding requests and responses and, most importantly, from the machine perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes a light-weight prototype system for tracing the source of requests/responses using provenance information over CoAP in the Internet of Things. We also provide performance evaluation of the prototypic system using metrics such as response time (ms) and throughput (KB/s). Finally, findings from our experiment are presented and discussed. "

Radio Frequency IDentification, putting an identification label into every object, enables a smart system to get information, either real-time or virtual-linked information, without any physical contact. Information retrieved from such an object, turns it into a potential smart object, certainly able to auto identify itself and, if security problems are suitably treated, most probably able to connect to the global Internet. This way, one can get an ubiquitous framework to access, monitor and control any of those smart objects over an Internet of connected things. \{RFID\} tags in medical context enable a rapid and precise identification of each smart entity, enabling a ubiquitous and quick access to Personal Health Records over an Internet of Things. The use of smart phones with Internet access, along with strong security concerns - such as authenticity, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, entity authentication and non-repudiation - turn this whole context into a decentralized and mobile healthcare system. Using the simple IoT architecture presented, combining smart objects, the security solution and mobile communications, one may remotely take care of patients’ well being, establishing an ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living for Mobile Health applications.

We show how basic technical information represented as \{RDF\} data can be used to automatically classify IoT devices, how default capabilities can be deduced from these classifications, and how advanced features can be inferred using domain semantics and formal reasoning. The applicability of the presented approach in real world settings is demonstrated by a concrete example from an IoT use case. "

The functionality can be encapsulated as services and the task executed by composing the services. Two noteworthy functionalities of IoT services are monitoring and actuation. Monitoring implies continuous executions, and actuation is by triggering. Continuous executions typically involve stream processing. Stream input data are accumulated into batches and each batch is subjected to a sequence of computations, structured as a dataflow graph. The composition may be processing several batches simultaneously. Additionally, some non-stream \{OLTP\} transactions may also be executing concurrently. Thus, several composite transactions may be executing concurrently. This is in contrast to a typical Web services composition, where just one composite transaction is executed on each invocation. Therefore, defining transactional properties for executions of IoT service compositions is much more complex than for those of conventional Web service compositions. In this paper, we propose a transaction model and a correctness criterion for executions of IoT service compositions. Our proposal defines relaxed atomicity and isolation properties for transactions in a flexible manner and can be adapted for a variety of IoT applications. "

This heterogeneity is reflected on raw data gathered by such type of systems. Consequently, the task of high-level IoT applications to interpret such data and detect events in the real world is more complex. Moreover, data heterogeneity leads to the lack of interoperability between IoT applications. Semantic Web (SW) technologies have been widely adopted to model and integrate data from different sources on the web; extending them to the IoT domain can be used to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Semantically annotating IoT data is a fundamental step toward developing smarter and interoperable IoT applications. However, this type of process requires a large amount of computing resources, especially in scenarios where a large number of sensors is expected to be involved such as smart city. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight semantic annotation approach that can be implemented on resource-constrained IoT gateways connected to a limited number of sensors. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have carried out a set of experimentations using a middleware prototype implementation. Several benchmarks are considered such as: Data size, response time, and resource utilization. "

The demand-side management (DSM) of energy systems has drawn considerable industrial and academic attention in attempts to form new flexibilities to respond to variations in renewable energy inputs to the system. However, many \{DSM\} concepts are still in the experimental demonstration phase. One of the obstacles to \{DSM\} usage is that the current information infrastructure was mainly designed for centralized systems, and does not meet \{DSM\} requirements. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a novel information infrastructure named the Internet of Energy Things (IoET) in order to make \{DSM\} practicable by basing it on the latest wireless communication technology: the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The primary advantage of \{LPWAN\} over general packet radio service (GPRS) and area Internet of Things (IoT) is its wide-area coverage, which comes with minimum power consumption and maintenance costs. Against this background, this paper briefly reviews the representative \{LPWAN\} technologies of narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Range (LoRa) technology, and compares them with \{GPRS\} and area IoT technology. Next, a wireless-to-cloud architecture is proposed for the IoET, based on the main technical features of LPWAN. Finally, this paper looks forward to the potential of IoET in various \{DSM\} application scenarios. "

When a number of these symptoms collectively detected in a person, he usually diagnosed with dementia. These people have problems in managing their daily activities and shortly become unable to live by themselves. Ways to prolong the independent life of elderly people have drawn the attention of a large scientific community. In this paper, we present an integrated system design that allows collection, recording and transmission through a cloud application of the data from different sensors placed in a house of a person having dementia. The concept of this work is a part of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) where information from smart things around us can be evaluated and transmitted over the internet. "

Because the traditional healthcare mode is passive, by which patients call the healthcare service by themselves. Consequently, they usually fail to call the service if they are unconscious when the heart disease attacks. The Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have overwhelming superiority in solving the problem of heart diseases patients care as they can change the service mode into a pervasive way, and trigger the healthcare service based on patients’ physical status rather than their feelings. In order to realize the pervasive healthcare service, a remote monitoring system is essential. In this paper, we proposed a pervasive monitoring system that can send patients’ physical signs to remote medical applications in real time. The system is mainly composed of two parts: the data acquisition part and the data transmission part. The monitoring scheme (monitoring parameters and frequency for each parameter) is the key point of the data acquisition part, and we designed it based on interviews to medical experts. Multiple physical signs (blood pressure, ECG, SpO2, heart rate, pulse rate, blood fat and blood glucose) as well as an environmental indicator (patients’ location) are designed to be sampled at different rates continuously. Four data transmission modes are presented taking patients’ risk, medical analysis needs, demands for communication and computing resources into consideration. Finally, a sample prototype is implemented to present an overview of the system. "

In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed.

Within this realm, innovations such as the Industrial Internet of Things, Cloud-based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM), and Social Product Development (SPD) have emerged with a focus on capitalizing on the benefits and economies of scale provided by Internet Protocol (IP) communication technologies. Another emerging idea is the notion of software-defined systems such as software-defined networks, which exploit abstraction and inexpensive hardware advancements in an effort to build more flexible systems. Recently, the authors have begun considering how the notion of software-defined systems might be harnessed to achieve flexible cloud manufacturing systems. As a result, this paper introduces the notion of Software-Defined Cloud Manufacturing (SDCM). We describe a basic \{SDCM\} architecture based on leveraging abstraction between manufacturing hardware and cloud-based applications, services, and platforms. The goal of \{SDCM\} is to advance Cloud-Based Manufacturing and other Industry 4.0 pillars by providing agility, flexibility, and adaptability while also reducing various complexity challenges. "

As the number of patients’ requests increases in simultaneously manner, the healthcare hub server located in the village hall encounters limitations for performing them successfully and concurrently. In this paper, we propose the design tasks of the Remote Healthcare Monitoring application for handling concurrency tasks. In the procedure of designing tasks, concurrency is best understood by employing multiple levels of abstraction. The way that is eminently to accomplish concurrency is to build an object-oriented environment with support for messages passing between concurrent objects. Node.js, a cross-platform runtime environment features technologies for handling concurrency issue efficiently for Remote Healthcare Monitoring System. The experiments results show that server-side JavaScript with Node.js and MongoDB as database is 40% faster than Apache Sling. With Node.js developers can build a high-performance, asynchronous, event-driven healthcare hub server to handle an increasing number of concurrent connections for Remote Healthcare Monitoring System in an isolated village with no access to local medical care.

Although sensor based Internet of Things (IoT) positioning has been developed, there are still key challenges when benchmarked approaches concentrate on precision, using computationally expensive filtering and iterative statistical or heuristic algorithms, as a trade-off for timeliness and scalability. Precise but high-cost hardware systems and invasive infrastructures of wired devices also pose implementation issues in the Industrial IoT (IIoT).

With the advent of IoT and its introduction into almost all aspects of life, safety and security of IoT devices has to be considered for their whole life cycle. This concerns not only the large amounts of data that needs to be exchanged securely but also the design of the hardware of the devices themselves. Security has to be designed right from the start into IoT devices rather than added on later. This paper will introduce a global strategy for secure Design for IoT which includes:• Safe solutions for environments with rich information • Guarantee that the devices are functioning as intended by the manufacturer and are not damaged • Life cycle security across devices, networks and data centers • Support for industry standards and interoperability of devices • Ability to solve the challenges of the information link • Secure Clouds for traditional systems. This paper lays the foundation for the creation of a safe remote monitoring system for machine tools through IoT devices and analyses the critical issues focusing on the manufacturing environment. "

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation. "

It enables multiple communication protocols binding, reuse of existing remote devices management mechanisms, and interworking with existing legacy devices. Addressing the \{M2\} M complexity issue, a new \{M2\} M service based on the autonomic computing paradigm and semantic models is defined to provide dynamic discovery and reconfiguration mechanisms.

While mobile applications make it possible to use secure Tags that store information in user-defined formats that are only recognized by a mobile application, this is not possible when IoT solutions are based on Web applications that make use of the \{NFC\} controller of mobile devices. Therefore, these \{NFC\} solutions are subject to possible falsifications of the \{NFC\} Tags that make it impossible to apply them to areas where the authentication of the Tags is required. The proposal presented in this work combines the use of beacons (BLE) and the physical Web for the authentication of the Tags. Beacons are used to guarantee the location of users and the broadcast of \{URLs\} that are received by users through the physical Web. These URLs, once validated, are responsible for generating credentials that authenticate the \{NFC\} Tags and guarantee the secure interactions of the users in IoT scenarios. "

To make the components of the systems act intelligently, according to users’ needs, and understand and predict behavior of the cyber-physical systems, the cyber-physical systems need reasoning to link the outcome of the different components to be able to make use of the devices in the surrounding environment. The reasoning includes collecting sensor data, finding key concepts in the data and drawing conclusions that cyber-physical systems can use to control the components surrounding the users. However, there is a range of different components in a system where each has particular communication input-output and its own set tasks, which provides particular challenges associated with controlling or predicting the behavior of such systems, which require a kind of analytic tools. This paper presents reasoning strategies for smart cyber-physical systems that can extract and combine data, information, and knowledge to provide an intelligent behavior from users point of view. The reasoning strategies use users’ needs as a starting point and provide an environment that gives personalized support. "

Also, when the accuracy of data is most importantly in the Internet of Things, detecting sensor data with faulty readings is an important issue of secure communication and power consumption. So, requirement of energy-efficiency and integrity of information is mandatory. Thus, cryptography is an effective technique that provides integrity to sensed data. In contrast, we can’t simply transferred traditional cryptographic techniques to \{WSNs\} due to sensors constraints. This paper, deals with the proposition of a novel energy-efficient and data integrity version of \{LEACH\} based routing protocol on Watermarking for wireless sensor networks because \{LEACH\} routing protocol does not take the security aspect into consideration and the secure improved \{LEACH\} works are based only on cryptographic techniques. Our hybrid proposed approach based on the Watermarking-LEACH achieves not only data integrity but also Energy-Efficient. It is the first schema that attempts to add security based on watermarking to \{LEACH\} routing protocol. To this end, we simulated and evaluated our \{WSN\} before and after falsification and we implemented our Watermarking-LEACH approach to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of integrity by evaluating the false negative rate (FNR) and in terms of energy-efficient through computing the energy consumption and compared its performance against other works by evaluating remaining energy metric across using the \{COOJA\} Simulator.

Moreover, such an identity framework is now critical in the Internet of Things. To address this problem, identification solutions have been proposed in the past leveraging software or hardware properties of devices. While those solutions proved feasible, their root of trust was based either within the device or in a remote server. In this paper, we overcome the above paradigm and star investigating novel perspectives offered by an overarching identity framework that is not based on client/server properties, but on the network latency of their communications. The core idea behind our approach is to leverage cloud client/server interactions’ latency patterns over the network to derive unique and unpredictable identity factors. Such factors can be used to design and implement effective identification schemes especially suitable for cloud-based services. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first one ensuring unclonability and unpredictability properties, relying on neither trusted computing bases (TCBs) nor on classical pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). The experimental tests presented in this paper, conducted on worst case conditions, show that the network latency (generated between two interacting devices) can produce random values with properties close to the ones generated by most of the well-known PRNGs, that are an ideal fit for providing unique identifiers.

Today, IoT objects offer embedded intelligence that can be powerful in case of fully integration of a collective manner towards the satisfaction of user needs. This work is based on the micro-clouds that are a new proposing paradigm to highlight the collective intelligence of IoT objects. Specifically, a micro-cloud could be seen as a pool of cooperated devices and their resources that form transient smart environments. Further to this, we anticipate that the inter-cloud model can expand the micro-cloud capabilities by allowing multiple micro-clouds to communicate in order to achieve a common aim. This will further push the boundaries for studying the interaction and synergetic collaborative nature between micro-cloud systems in terms of their interoperability and performance. However as the size of the system is increased the complexity of performance is additionally increased. This emphasizes the need for decentralization where resources are changing over time without any notice. The vision of this work is that micro-clouds shall be linked together to enable a full network of usable IoT objects and at the same time maintain the required quality of service from an end-user's perspective. Specifically, the aim is to identify the specific criteria which are the most relevant to optimize performance when several micro-clouds collaborate (e.g. load-balancing, throughput, turn-around times, utilization level, etc.) as well as classify their functional requirements. So the focus is on the performance analysis and evaluation of results based on a simulated specific use case scenario. "

Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based \{DTLS\} handshake protocol as it is the main \{IP\} security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a \{TI\} SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The \{CC2538\} module integrated into the \{TI\} board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.

However, labeling of data is costly and becomes infeasible when dealing with big data, such as those generated by IoT (Internet of Things) -based applications. To this effect, building a \{ML\} model that learns from non- or partially-labeled data is of critical importance. This paper proposes a Semi-supervised Multi-Layered Clustering Model (SMLC) for network intrusion detection and prevention tasks. The \{SMLC\} has the capability to learn from partially labeled data while achieving a comparable detection performance to supervised ML-based IDPS. The performance of the \{SMLC\} is compared with a well-known semi-supervised model (i.e., tri-training) and supervised ensemble \{ML\} models, namely, RandomForest, Bagging, and AdaboostM1 on two benchmark network intrusion datasets, the \{NSL\} and Kyoto 2006+. Experimental results show that \{SMLC\} is superior to tri-training, providing a comparable detection accuracy with 20% less labeled instances of the training data. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that our scheme has a comparable detection accuracy to that of the supervised ensemble models. "

IoT services are a key solution for providing smart environments in homes, buildings, and cities. In the era of massive number of connected things and objects with high growth rate, several challenges have been raised, such as management, aggregation, and storage for big produced data. To address some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to the IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT), which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large-scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be considered in the design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying a suitable “Middleware” which sits between things and applications as a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and characteristics of middlewares. Next, we study different architecture styles and service domains. Then, we presents several middlewares that are suitable for CoT-based platforms and finally, a list of current challenges and issues in the design of CoT-based middlewares are discussed. "

Given a sensor network that gathers relative data – that is data for which ratios of parts are more important than absolute values – acquired data have a compositional nature and all values need to be scaled. To analyze these data a common practice is to map bijectively compositions into the ordinary euclidean space through a suitable transformation, so that standard multivariate analysis techniques can be used. In this paper an error bound on the commonly used asymmetric log-ratio transformation is found in the Simplex. The purpose is to highlight areas of the Simplex where the transformation is ill conditioned and to isolate values for which the additive log-ratio transform cannot be accurately computed. Results show that the conditioning of the transformation is strongly affected by the closeness of the transformed values and that not negligible distortions can be generated due to the unbounded propagation of the errors. An explicit formula for the accuracy of the sensors given the maximum allowed tolerance has been derived, and the critical values in the Simplex where the transformation is component-wise ill conditioned have been isolated.

Frequent patterns can identify channels or infrastructures to be strengthened and can help in choosing the most suitable message routing schema or network protocol.

However, in the practical applications one is concerned with flow domains of large extents where α undergoes to significant spatial variations as consequence of the disordered soil's structure. To account for such a variability (hereafter also termed as “heterogeneity”) we adopt the mining geostatistical approach, which regards α as a random space function (RSF). To quantify the heterogeneity of α, estimates of local-values were obtained from ∼ 100 locations along a trench where an internal drainage test was conducted. The analysis of the statistical moments of α demonstrates (in line with the current literature on the matter) that the log-transform ζ ln α can be regarded as a structureless, normally distributed, RSF.

An insecure communication channel between a tag and a reader makes the \{RFID\} implant system vulnerable to attacks and endangers the user's safety and privacy. The proposed scheme relies on elliptic curve cryptography and the D-Quark lightweight hash design. Compared to the available public-key cryptosystems, elliptic curve-based cryptosystems are the best choice due to their small key sizes as well as their efficiency in computations. The D-Quark lightweight hash design is tailored for resource constrained pervasive devices, cost, and performance. The security analysis of the proposed authentication scheme revealed that it is secure against the relevant threat models and provides a higher security level than related work found in the literature. The computational performance comparison shows that our work has 48% less communication overhead compared to existing similar schemes. It also requires 24% less total memory than the other approaches. The required computational time of our scheme is generally similar to other existing schemes. Hence, the presented scheme is a well-suited choice for providing security for the resource-constrained \{RFID\} implant systems. "

In this paper, we study mobility issues and scenarios which may occur in the 6LoWPAN network. We also propose an approach to manage the mobility of nodes efficiently based on received signal strength and link quality. Simple load-balancing technique is also incorporated. The 6LoWPAN based Wireless Sensor Network can be integrated with grid computing establishing a Sensor-Grid which may also be used in various applications. "

To this end, two different scenarios are implemented using the Cooja simulator. The first one is based on group models. The second scenario is based on the entity mobility models. Our simulation results show that \{RPL\} performances are greatly influenced by the number of nodes, the number of sink nodes, and the mobility type. The scalability of the network increases all metrics while providing less packet loss. Additionally, the number of sink nodes directly affects the \{RPL\} performances. The energy consumption is reduced in the case of multiple sink nodes by 55.86%, which is less than the case of a single sink. "

Using WiMAX as backhaul service, the Internet connection can be provided for dispersed mobile LR-WPAN users over a wide area. Moreover, it enables to access all collected data in the local LR-WPAN coverage area – which is named as Senspot in this paper – by third-party clients through the Internet. Furthermore, an analytic model has been developed for the integrated network to evaluate the system's performance.

But differences are at the possibilities of modern ergonomics, movement of science and technical possibilities. The options of using a mobile applications, Internet of Things, data gathering and their real time evaluation and their sharing. We present those solutions that combine traditional knowledge and modern technologies. The results are innovative and advanced ergonomic tools based on Industry 4.0 concept. Electronic tools are a new direction in ergonomics. With the support of mobile applications we see a way to create healthy conditions at work for production and also non-production workers, assembly and logistics. At the beginning of 20-th century, majority of us had no idea what the ergonomics is, how many risks occur during our job that they are connected with the health of employees and have not known that special methods and tools for their identification, analysis, evaluation and identification are developed. With the growing development of society we got to stadium when, luckily, majority of companies – employers even know the meaning of ergonomics or work risks, about risks at their workplaces and establish their evaluation and try to eliminate them. We have many methods and tools of modern ergonomics which enable us to realize analysis and optimization of employee's work to their benefit. Considering experience we can surely claim that we know the main problem of these days. It is requisite to realize ergonomic evaluation perfectly, extensively and mainly quickly. Slowness of some solutions discourages managers and directors and makes effective improving of work conditions impossible. The idea of mobile application developing which works as a screening tool came with demands from big companies that have dozens of workplaces and cannot identify work risks by themselves. Ceit \{ERgonomics\} Analysis Application, which is described in article, is output of our own research and development. It is a mobile application developed in \{CEIT\} Company in collaboration with the University of Žilina and Slovak ergonomic association. It is a screening evaluation of space conditions and work positions of workers at potentially risky workplaces. It is developed at the base of legislation and technical norms, at our own platform, with the support of virtual and augmented reality. The main goal of evaluation by the \{CERAA\} usage is to find out if the workplace is risky from the ergonomic view. It is an innovative way of applied augmented reality tools during the ergonomic evaluation of chosen workplaces. Nowadays, the new submodules are being developed. They will identify risks at administrative workplaces, submodule which will evaluate working with loads and other that will evaluate repetitive operations. \{CERAA\} is used in several industrial companies in Slovakia and Czech Republic from the second half of 2016.

In this paper, the proposed system can sense the changes of contexts and adapt the light status appropriately.

Among many biometric traits, fingerprint-based identification systems have been extensively studied and deployed. However, to adopt biometric identification systems in practical applications, two main obstacles in terms of efficiency and client privacy must be resolved simultaneously. That is, identification should be performed at an acceptable time, and only a client should have access to his/her biometric traits, which are not revocable if leaked. Until now, multiple studies have demonstrated successful protection of client biometric data; however, such systems lack efficiency that leads to excessive time utilization for identification. The most recently researched scheme shows efficiency improvements but reveals client biometric traits to other entities such as biometric database server. This violates client privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving fingerprint identification scheme by using cloud systems. The proposed scheme extensively exploits the computation power of a cloud so that most of the laborious computations are performed by the cloud service provider. According to our experimental results on an Amazon \{EC2\} cloud, the proposed scheme is faster than the existing schemes and guarantees client privacy by exploiting symmetric homomorphic encryption. Our security analysis shows that during identification, the client fingerprint data is not disclosed to the cloud service provider or fingerprint database server. "

Yet there are many technical and commercial challenges which question the future of peer-assisted solutions in industrial settings. This includes among others unreliability of peer-to-peer networks, the lack of incentives for peers’ participation, and copyright issues. In this paper, we carefully review and systematize this ongoing debate around the future of peer-assisted networks and propose a novel taxonomy to characterize the research and industrial efforts in the area. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the last decade in the peer-assisted content delivery research and devise a novel taxonomy to characterize the identified challenges and the respective proposed solutions in the literature. Our survey includes a thorough review of the three very large scale feasibility studies conducted for \{BBC\} iPlayer, \{MSN\} Video and Conviva, five large commercial peer-assisted \{CDNs\} - Kankan, LiveSky, Akamai NetSession, Spotify, Tudou - and a vast scope of technical papers. We focus both on technical challenges in deploying peer-assisted solutions and also on non-technical challenges caused due to heterogeneity in user access patterns and distribution of resources among users as well as commercial feasibility related challenges attributed to the necessity of accounting for the interests and incentives of Internet Service Providers, End-Users and Content Providers. The results of our study suggest that many of technical challenges for implementing peer-assisted content delivery networks on an industrial scale have been already addressed in the literature, whereas a problem of finding economically viable solutions to incentivize participation in peer-assisted schemes remains an open issue to a large extent. Furthermore, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable expansion of conventional \{CDNs\} to a broader network of connected devices through machine to machine communication. "

Although the general requirements of 5G systems are progressively taking shape, the technological issues raised by such a vision are still partially unclear.

Indeed, it is argued that the so-called ‘Smart Mobility’ transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed – will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.

Systematic performance management of healthcare processes is important in determining if quality of care goals are being met at all levels of the healthcare ecosystem. The challenge is that reaching these goals requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system. In this paper, we review various cloud computing applications for surveillance and performance management of quality of care in healthcare. We also introduce a framework for achieving systematic surveillance and performance management across the entire healthcare system. "

We work under the hypothesis that a risk-prone situation produces sudden and significant deviations in standard physiological and behavioural user patterns. These changes can be captured by a group of sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate. We introduce a dataset, called PRIDE, which provides a baseline for the development and the fair comparison of personal risk detection mechanisms. \{PRIDE\} contains information on 18 test subjects; for each subject, it includes partial information about the user’s behavioural and physiological patterns, as captured by Microsoft Band©. \{PRIDE\} test subject records include sensor readings of not only when a subject is carrying out ordinary daily life activities, but also when exposed to a stressful scenario, thereby simulating a dangerous or abnormal situation. We show how to use \{PRIDE\} to develop a personal risk detection mechanism; to accomplish this, we have tackled risk detection as a one-class classification problem. We have trained several classifiers based only on the daily behaviour of test subjects. Further, we tested the accuracy of the classifiers to detect anomalies that were not included in the training process of the classifiers. We used a number of one-class classifiers, namely: SVM, Parzen, and two versions of Parzen based on k-means. While there is still room for improvement, our results are encouraging: they support our hypothesis that abnormal behaviour can be automatically detected. "

abstract = "Abstract Big Data (BD), with their potential to ascertain valued insights for enhanced decision-making process, have recently attracted substantial interest from both academics and practitioners. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of \{BDA\} tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly \{BD\} tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the \{BDA\} landscape. Given the significant nature of the \{BD\} and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the \{BD\} challenges and \{BDA\} methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on \{BD\} and \{BDA\} area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: \{Q1\} – What are the different types of \{BD\} challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and \{Q2\} – What are the different types of \{BDA\} methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome \{BD\} challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the \{BDA\} research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of \{BD\} strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant \{BD\} research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the \{BDA\} in technology and organizational resource management discipline.

Finally, this article presents critiques of posthumanism from critical race theory and decolonial theory to consider how emergent design perspectives might better support values such as equality and justice for humans and nonhumans that have been traditionally ignored in design processes.

In departing from the traditional centralized model of manufacturing, decentralized manufacturing divides production across sites or geographic regions. This paradigm shift imposes significant structural and organisational changes on a business presenting both hidden challenges that must be addressed and opportunities to be embraced. By profoundly adapting business practices, significant advantages can be realized through a democratized value chain, creation of professional-level jobs without geographic restriction to the central hub and a flexibility in response to external pressures and demands. To realize these potential opportunities, however, advances in manufacturing technology and support systems are required, as well as significant changes in the way \{CGTs\} are regulated to facilitate multi-site manufacturing. Decentralized manufacturing is likely to be the manufacturing platform of choice for advanced health care therapies—in particular, those with a high degree of personalization. The future success of these promising products will be enhanced by adopting sound business strategies early in development. To realize the benefits that decentralized manufacturing of \{CGTs\} has to offer, it is important to examine both the risks and the substantial opportunities present. In this research, we examine both the challenges and the opportunities this shift in business strategy represents in an effort to maximize the success of adoption. "

In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare. The context broker that is presented in this paper addresses some critical healthcare issues: availability, cost and quality. This broker is for general and specialised healthcare needs in specific medical fields, and it is especially useful in emergency situations. It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria. The context broker collects queries from users (patients or their dependents), and refers them to the best and most affordable hospitals on the basis of their geographical location, financial status, quality of care and the availability of the requested medical services at the time their request is made.

Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology. The second contribution is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of this ontology. In fact, an IoT Medicare system is proposed to evaluate the HealthIoT ontology. "

While in several outdoor scenarios modern Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are sufficiently precise, they are less reliable in indoor situations. This is undesirable as often cars move from outdoor to indoor scenarios and vice versa (think for example to cars leaving a box, or entering a tunnel). For this reason large research effort has been recently devoted to integrate \{GNSS\} systems in order to improve indoor positioning accuracy. In this paper we present Vehicle-2-Vehicle Elastic Network, a novel metodology that allows accurate vehicular indoor positioning based on a dead-reckoning technique via an Indoor Inertial Navigation System, aided by an elastic graph generated by a V2V-WiFi system. The received signal strength (RSS) from nearby cars is detected, and is used to improve the location via RSS-to distance information crowdsourcing. "

These issues go beyond questions of clinical utility and validity to those of data security, personal identity, race, and the nature of the family.

This independent evaluation omits important aspects of the integrated system, where the impacts resulting from malicious or opportunistic attacks are not easily known or understood. We describe a discrete event simulation model that uses information about integrated physical and cyber security systems, attacker characteristics and simple response rules to identify key safeguards that limit an attacker's likelihood of success. Key features of the proposed model include comprehensive data generation to support a variety of sophisticated analyses, and full parameterization of safeguard performance characteristics and attacker behaviours to evaluate a range of scenarios. We also describe the core data requirements and the network of networks that serves as the underlying simulation structure. "

The most viable option of implementing \{M2M\} communication is over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. A key challenge for \{M2M\} communication over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the performance of Random Access Channel (RACH) because its operation was not designed with the enormous number of \{M2M\} devices in mind. To deal with the situation reduces network access success rate, several major access control methods were adopted. However, the suggested methods generally increase the access success rate regardless of delay requirements. On the other hand, access delay is crucial for many \{M2M\} applications such as healthcare. This paper investigates the effects of \{LTE\} Random Access Methods on healthcare \{M2M\} applications when enormous number of devices are introduced. The study clearly shows that to meet the requirements for delay sensitive \{M2M\} applications, the random access (RA) resources should be very strictly and carefully allocated. "

Privacy though is a very important aspect that people always require in many sectors, and it's not less important in the healthcare industry, where information only gets even more personal and sensitive that any privacy breach becomes an issue of life or death. In this paper, we have focused on the benefits of big data in the healthcare sector, as well as some of the main challenges often encountered. We have then concentrated on the Moroccan context, shown the problems it has and its specificities, in order to suggest recommendations to encourage the decision makers to take the path of Big Data. And finally, we have enlightened the privacy issues in healthcare and the current methods used to ensure the patient's privacy. "

However, in healthcare, such practices, beyond elicitation, are immature. The introduction of changes to existing healthcare processes or e-systems often fails because users’ needs and operational/organizational goals may not get satisfied. In addition, healthcare is moving toward a value-based paradigm that requires a comprehensive evaluation and re-engineering of current processes, which puts more pressure on healthcare professionals to apply advanced \{RE\} techniques, such as goal and process modeling, in order to obtain much desired results effectively. In this paper, we discuss the integration of new technology-depending processes, e.g., that come with off-the-shelf solutions, with existing healthcare processes. We propose the use of an Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) framework to investigate the impact of each potential integration on the organizational goals and user satisfaction. Performance indicators are used to reason about measurable quantities beyond goal satisfaction. The paper implements the AbPI approach with the User Requirement Notation standard and illustrates its feasibility with a real example related to wait time indication in an emergency room. Important research challenges are identified along the way. "

Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification \{RFID\} scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.

We extend this novel concept in this paper and refer it as “Healthcare services on-the-fly”. The concept of game theory has been used among the vehicles to access the healthcare services while traveling. The vehicles act as players in the game and tend to form and split coalitions to access these services. Learning automata (LA) act as the players for interaction with the environment and take appropriate actions based on reward and penalty. Apart from this, Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling algorithm for efficient utilization of resources at cloud level has also been formulated. A stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model is used to represent the coalition formation and splitting with respect to availability of resources at cloud level. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the best, first, and random fit schemes. "

The networks can consist of high- and low-resource nodes ranging from generic computers to microchips, and the supported network classes range from body area networks to the Internet including any kind of sensor and ambient network. Agents are represented by mobile program code that can be modified at run-time. The presented approach enables the development of sensor clouds and smart systems of the future integrated in daily use computing environments and the Internet. Agents can migrate between different hardware and software platforms by migrating the program code of the agent, embedding the state and the data of an agent, too. The entire information exchange and coordination of agents with other agents and the environment is performed by using a tuple space database. Beside architecture specific hardware and software implementations of the agent processing platform, there is a JavaScript (JS) implemen- tation layered on the top of a distributed management layer. The \{JS\} platform enables the integration of Multi-agent Systems (MAS) in Internet server and application environments (e.g., \{WEB\} browser).

A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets. "

The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing. "

Our results show that using the trend curve deviation as target variable has potential to improve the prediction accuracy (compared to using the absolute number of bicycles as target variable).

To address these concerns, we have developed the Long Life Application, a dynamic context-aware situation-based distributed mobile application dedicated to assist end-users in their everyday needs. This application considers the requirements of the users and provides them with the appropriate services according to their current context. In this paper we focus in the way that the user’s context is considered by the application. We propose a hybrid approach that combines both high-level context (top-down approach), by injecting user-related context, and a low-level context (bottom-up approach), by inferring it from sensor data.

However, we have not found any work where all these technologies have been brought together to develop a mobile application that provides uniquely focused information on user mobility. Google Maps notifications could provide information about nearby road closure or other events where relevant. However, we propose to pull in and provide information to the users about their travel locally, nationally, and internationally. More importantly, relevant information is pulled in from multiple news media and other sources and provided to the user in multimedia formats including text, voice and video. "

Field testing results, power consumption, L-P wavelet transform methods, and feasibility analysis are reported. One application scenario is described: the electromagnetic energy harvester together with the DC-DC boost converter is used as a local energy source for powering the sensor nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the abnormal signals of out-of-round wheels are identified based on the measured rail acceleration signals and L-P wavelet analysis.

This holds not only for regular users but also for people with special needs such as the elderly and people with disabilities. The appropriate design of smart homes can enable a more independent life for these users and can give them the chance to stay in their familiar environment for a longer period of time. Hence, the smart home concept can play an important role when addressing the demographic change that is present in most industrial countries. However, although technologies seem to be advanced and the expected benefits are high, a wide-spread adoption has not yet taken place. There are various reasons for this situation. Among them, the lack of appropriate user interfaces for the heterogeneous user group of future smart homes and the problem of low interoperability between different smart home systems can be mentioned. Two platforms addressing these problems are the Eclipse Smart Home (ESH) project and the Universal Remote Console (URC). \{ESH\} focuses on the integration of different device and back-end technologies; \{URC\} provides a personalized, pluggable user interface. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences between the two systems. As a result of the analysis, a concept for integrating the ideas of \{URC\} into the \{ESH\} project is proposed. This concept is a first step towards a platform for personalized user interfaces in the Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living domain. "

However, the application of regulatory bioinformatics also poses new challenges and requires new knowledge and skill sets. In the latest Global Coalition on Regulatory Science Research (GCRSR) governed conference, Global Summit on Regulatory Science (GSRS2015), regulatory bioinformatics principles were presented with respect to global trends, initiatives and case studies. The discussion revealed that datasets, analytical tools, skills and expertise are rapidly developing, in many cases via large international collaborative consortia. It also revealed that significant research is still required to realize the potential applications of regulatory bioinformatics. While there is significant excitement in the possibilities offered by precision medicine to enhance treatments of serious and/or complex diseases, there is a clear need for further development of mechanisms to securely store, curate and share data, integrate databases, and standardized quality control and data analysis procedures. A greater understanding of the biological significance of the data is also required to fully exploit vast datasets that are becoming available. The application of bioinformatics in the microbiological risk analysis paradigm is delivering clear benefits both for the investigation of food borne pathogens and for decision making on clinically important treatments. It is recognized that regulatory bioinformatics will have many beneficial applications by ensuring high quality data, validated tools and standardized processes, which will help inform the regulatory science community of the requirements necessary to ensure the safe introduction and effective use of these applications.

Further, they review the literature and put forward important research questions to be addressed within and across these periods.

Objectives In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25 years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges. Discussion Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis. Conclusions Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.

However, current enterprise systems lack a significant involvement of the human aspects. An innovation model can incorporate those three components to provide greater value to stakeholders, drive organizational growth, gain a competitive advantage and achieve greater end-user satisfaction. We investigated how an enterprise systems model for open innovation could be created based on existing innovation socio-technical frameworks and how that model may benefit the \{UK\} National Health Service (NHS). We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the \{NHS\} is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments. The model strategy comprises rewarding people with shopping vouchers (Tesco club card points or nectar points) each time they confirm or cancel a medical appointment online or by \{SMS\} text message. With this model, the \{NHS\} would improve the management of their resources, may improve the quality of service and may have higher user satisfaction. Nevertheless, future challenges may include the adaptation of current \{NHS\} business processes and the management of the collaboration with private organizations. "

This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘(’omic)’ approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established’omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially \{SNPs\} and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.

The wave of mega-trends, including rapid change in globalization and technological advances, is creating new market forces. For any organization to survive and prosper in such an environment, innovation is imperative. However, innovation is no longer just for creating value to benefit individuals, organizations, or societies. The ultimate purpose of innovation should be much more far reaching, helping create a smart future where people can enjoy the best quality of life possible. Thus, innovation must search for intelligent solutions to tackle major social ills, seek more proactive approaches to predict the uncertain future, and pursue strategies to remove barriers to the smart future. This study explores the detailed requirements of a smart future, including both hardware types and soft social/cultural components. "

In this work, we present a general framework that, by using the Matrix Factorization (MF) approach and a graph representation of a museum, addresses the problem of generating and then recommending an artworks sequence for a group of visitors within a museum. To reach a high-quality initial personalization, the recommendation system uses a simple, but efficient, elicitation method that is inspired by the \{MF\} approach. Moreover, the proposed approach considers the individual or the aggregated artworks’ ratings to build up a solution that takes into account the physical location of the artworks. "

abstract = "Abstract Stream processing is about processing continuous streams of data by programs in a workflow. Continuous execution is discretized by grouping input stream tuples into batches and using one batch at a time for the execution of programs. As source input batches arrive continuously, several batches may be processed in the workflow simultaneously. A general requirement is that each batch be processed completely in the workflow. That is, all the programs triggered by the batch, directly and transitively, in the workflow must be executed successfully. Executing only a prefix of the workflow amounts to dropping (discarding) the batches that were derived by the executed part and were supposed to be input to the rest of the workflow. In some cases, such partial executions may not be acceptable and may have to be rolled back, amounting to dropping the source input batches that were processed by the partial execution. We refer to this property of processing the batches either completely or not at all as atomic execution of the batches. We also attribute the property to the batches themselves, calling them atomic batches, meaning that the property applies to the set of transactions that are executed due to that batch. If batches are processed in isolation in the workflow, preserving atomicity is fairly straightforward. When batches are split or merged along the workflow computation, the problem becomes complicated. In this paper, we study issues relating to the atomicity of batches. We illustrate that, in general, preserving atomicity of some batches may affect the atomicity of some other batches, and suggest trade-offs. "

As well, it is simply programmable in a high-level programming language. Here Maple 18 was in use. Results Trends and the slowest oscillations were obtained within a case study. The error of \{SSA\} estimations turned out to be close to the exactness of measuring. However, these errors are in good agreement with the known descriptors of the short-time variability. The periods of the slowest oscillations were different for the systolic and the diastolic pressures. Seasonality was about six months and about two months respectively. We found the amplitude of the slowest oscillations of heart rate varies in time. This fact is in contrast to the blood pressure fluctuations, for which the amplitudes are stable. Conclusions \{SSA\} is a promising tool for \{HBPM\} data processing. It ensures smooth and readable trends as well as shows the long-term variability of series.

The lack of interoperability hampers the integration and usage of these devices and services. Furthermore, one objective in the field of Ambient Intelligence and Human Machine Interaction is the adaption of assistive services to the user 5. This is deeply rooted in the idea that the usage of ambient technologies still means a barrier for elderly and impaired people and prevents them to trust and use these technologies. But as these technologies aim at supporting and not restricting elderly and impaired people, a methodology is needed to overcome the barrier of using ambient assistive technologies.

These definitions do not however provide equal prominence for the data governance within the cloud computing technology context. As such, this deficit calls for in-depth understanding of data governance and cloud Computing. This trend contributes to changes in data governance strategy in the organisation, such as the organisation’s structure and regulations, people, technology, process, roles and responsibilities. This is one of the great challenges facing organizations today when they move their data to Cloud Computing environments, particularly how Cloud technology affects data governance. The authors’ general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is concerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reaching maturity. This paper attempts to identify the possible common barriers and critical success factors for implementing cloud data governance in the hope that it helps the reader to be aware of these barriers and consider them in future developments in the field.

An assessment of their perceptions and practice of cervical screening could reveal gaps that would inspire efforts to improve key indicators among them and in turn, the general population. Methods This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 316 workers of a tertiary health facility selected by stratified random sampling with proportionate allocation. Data was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires and analysed with \{SPSS\} 20 and \{PEPI\} programs. Results The majority of respondents were aware of cervical cancer but it was significantly higher among females, p=.001. Most respondents, 266 (84.2%) were less than 40 years of age but knowledge of cervical cancer screening diminished with increase in age, p=.039. Only 92 (29%) had good knowledge of cervical screening; a better knowledge of cervical screening was significantly associated with working in a clinical department, employment duration of less than 2 years, and being female. All females who had ever screened for Ca cervix, 18 (11%) had a Pap smear, and majority 15 (83%) had screened only once. Factors associated with screening were level of education, years of work experience, and being in a clinical department. Reasons given for not screening included pain from the procedure, its cost, and the delay with getting results. Conclusion Knowledge of cervical screening was not good among staff of \{DELSUTH\} and practice of screening was also very poor. They may benefit from health education and promotion programmes directed towards better screening practices. Introduction of easier-to-perform and less costly screening modalities like VIA/VILI may also improve uptake. "

New emerging advanced therapies invest in genetic, electronics and cell-based therapy for addressing unmet needs for the caregivers and the patient. As digital process in health (eHealth) gains momentum, connected advanced bio-electronic devices now offer new strategies for personalized injection therapies. In this review, we take a journey along the genesis path of a new drug delivery system: the Optogenerapy, a synergy between optogenetic and gene therapy. Inside a bio-electronic implant, electronics and optogenetics are interfaced by light as a traceless inducer signal. By controlling a synthetic optogenetic pathway in the cell, therapeutics delivery can be fine-tuned with a precise spatiotemporal control.

We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application. Our solution was evaluated with usage data from a professional application built on the PalCom framework.

Technologies aimed at fall detection, assessment, prediction and prevention are emerging, yet there has been no consistency in describing or reporting on interventions using technologies. With the growth of eHealth and data driven interventions, a common language and classification is required. Objective The \{FARSEEING\} Taxonomy of Technologies was developed as a tool for those in the field of biomedical informatics to classify and characterise components of studies and interventions. Methods The Taxonomy Development Group (TDG) comprised experts from across Europe. Through face-to-face meetings and contributions via email, five domains were developed, modified and agreed: Approach; Base; Components of outcome measures; Descriptors of technologies; and Evaluation. Each domain included sub-domains and categories with accompanying definitions. The classification system was tested against published papers and further amendments undertaken, including development of an online tool. Six papers were classified by the \{TDG\} with levels of consensus recorded. Results Testing the taxonomy with papers highlighted difficulties in definitions across international healthcare systems, together with differences of \{TDG\} members’ backgrounds. Definitions were clarified and amended accordingly, but some difficulties remained. The taxonomy and manual were large documents leading to a lengthy classification process. The development of the online application enabled a much simpler classification process, as categories and definitions appeared only when relevant. Overall consensus for the classified papers was 70.66%. Consensus scores increased as modifications were made to the taxonomy. Conclusion The \{FARSEEING\} Taxonomy of Technologies presents a common language, which should now be adopted in the field of biomedical informatics. In developing the taxonomy as an online tool, it has become possible to continue to develop and modify the classification system to incorporate new technologies and interventions. "

In most applications, sensor nodes are constrained in energy supply and communication bandwidth. Therefore, novel techniques to reduce energy inefficiencies and for efficient use of the limited bandwidth resources are essential. Such constraints combined with dense network deployment pose several challenges to the design and management of \{WSNs\} and require energy-awareness at all layers of the networking protocol stack. For instance, at the Data-Link layer, low duty cycle Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols trade off latency for energy efficient operation. In this paper, we present a survey of state-of-the-art low duty cycle \{MAC\} protocols. We first outline the design challenges for \{MAC\} protocols in WSNs. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of the most prominent and recent \{MAC\} protocols. These protocols are classified into synchronous and asynchronous based on their mode of operation. Finally, the paper highlight open research problems in \{MAC\} layer for WSNs. "

Considerable energy saving can be achieved by reducing the power consumption during inactive (sleep) mode, notably in low data rate applications featured by long inactive periods. Without loss of generality, spot monitoring in a Smart Parking System (SPS) and soil moisture in a Precision Irrigation System (PIS) are selected as typical representative of low data rate applications. The performance of the new platform is investigated for typical scenarios of the selected applications and compared with that of MicaZ and TelosB. Energy measurements have been carried out for di_erent network operation states and settings, where the results reveal that the proposed platform allows to multiply the battery lifetime up to 7 times compared to MicaZ and TelosB motes in 10s sampling period scenarios.

Gateway nodes collect the sensed data from their respective network area and store the data in MySQL database for analysis and visualization through a portal. Through the test-bed user can remotely submit a sensor application (programs written in NesC) for compiling it using required softwares (TinyOS and NesC) and evaluating the performance of the application by downloading and executing them on dedicated sensing devices which form the test-bed.

To increase the charge carrier density in the channel region at a specific voltage, the capacitive coupling between the semiconductor and gate can be improved applying dielectrics with high permittivity without losing the malleability of the device. In this article, we analyze the frequency-dependent dielectric constant of a commercially available organic-inorganic nanocomposite and the influence of a titanium interlayer in-between the capacitor’s bottom electrode and the applied insulating film. Afterwards, an integration process for low-voltage C8-BTBT-based \{TFTs\} on freestanding polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates employing this hybrid dielectric is presented and the electrical characteristics of the transistors were evaluated.

Requirement analysis is a key software engineering task in the whole lifecycle of applications; however, the requirements for monitoring systems within edge computing scenarios are not yet fully established. The goal of the present survey study is therefore threefold: to identify the main challenges in the field of monitoring edge computing applications that are as yet not fully solved; to present a new taxonomy of monitoring requirements for adaptive applications orchestrated upon edge computing frameworks; and to discuss and compare the use of widely-used cloud monitoring technologies to assure the performance of these applications. Our analysis shows that none of existing widely-used cloud monitoring tools yet provides an integrated monitoring solution within edge computing frameworks.

The recent proliferation of big data provides numerous opportunities for information-intensive services (IISs), in which information interactions exert the greatest effect on value creation. In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in \{IISs\} is essential for using \{IT\} to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new \{IISs\} and by analyzing data usage in 149 \{IIS\} cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs. The main contribution of this study is to provide a simple yet comprehensive and empirically tested basis for the use and management of data to facilitate service value creation. "

We envision a distributed execution environment comprised of diverse computing resources as an alternative solution to this problem. This execution environment can be defined as a mobile cloud. However, the inherent unreliability of the mobile cloud requires developers to add reliability within the applications separately making the development process tedious. In this position paper, we present Aegis - a framework that provides a reliable and unified computing platform with built-in failure detection and repair mechanisms. Aegis draws upon the actor based execution model as well as stream processing applications to provide a reliable overlay over unreliable environments. Aegis also relives developers of the task of adding reliability mechanisms to applications separately. "

While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.

However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers’ attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers’ behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions. "

Furthermore, available systems are usually strongly technology-oriented and they neglect the user's satisfaction and the benefits’ analysis. In addition to this, modern systems impose the intelligent management of a huger amount of data, which needs to be properly coordinated to achieve higher performances and offer new energy-control services. This paper defines an information management model to improve device interoperability in smart homes. It allows selecting and classifying the devices, visualizing their data model, aggregating the necessary data according to the desired service functions, and finally defining a set of rules to coordinate device operations according to user preferences and external events. A case study focused on washing machines is presented to demonstrate the methodology implementation; it allows designing and developing an energy-control service for the selected device and optimizing its functions according to the users’ needs and preferences as well as the constraints of the use scenario. Finally, the benefits achieved with such a new service are evaluated in terms of energy consumption, costs reduction and user satisfaction in a simulated home environment that represents practical scenarios of use.

Standardisation plays a key role in shaping the rules that govern these developments and their effects on society. Due to the large variety of actors involved in these trends, the associated standardisation processes are likely to involve all three modes of standardisation identified in the literature: committee-based, market-based and government-based. This multi-mode standardisation challenges the theoretical views on standardisation which predominantly focus on one of the modes. In this paper, we review the existing literatures on individual modes and on multi-mode standardisation. By recombining existing evidence, we generate new insights into multi-mode standardisation processes. These first insights relate to the contributions that each mode can make to such processes’ outcomes and suggest that their impact depends on factors, such as their initiation’s timing and the institutional context in which the standardisation process occurs. Moreover, we consider the conditions under which actors can launch each mode. Based on our observations, we formulate an agenda for future research to obtain a better understanding of multi-mode standardisation. We offer recommendations for industry actors, NGOs, researchers and policy makers involved in shaping technological and societal change. "

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an emerging approach to satisfy this demand, where big data is cached ubiquitously in the network and retrieved using data names. However, existing authentication and authorization schemes rely mostly on centralized servers to provide certification and mediation services for data retrieval. This causes considerable traffic overhead for the secure distributed sharing of data. To solve this problem, we employ identity-based cryptography (IBC) to propose a Distributed Authentication and Authorization Scheme (DAAS), where an identity-based signature (IBS) is used to achieve distributed verifications of the identities of publishers and users. Moreover, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is used to enable the distributed and fine-grained authorization. \{DAAS\} consists of three phases: initialization, secure data publication, and secure data retrieval, which seamlessly integrate authentication and authorization with the interest/data communication paradigm in ICN. In particular, we propose trustworthy registration and Network Operator and Authority Manifest (NOAM) dissemination to provide initial secure registration and enable efficient authentication for global data retrieval. Meanwhile, Attribute Manifest (AM) distribution coupled with automatic attribute update is proposed to reduce the cost of attribute retrieval. We examine the performance of the proposed DAAS, which shows that it can achieve a lower bandwidth cost than existing schemes. "

The adoption of Product-Service Systems (PSS) strategies appears as a promising solution. However, practical application of \{PSS\} sustainable approaches is still limited. This may be associated to the fact that a \{PSS\} does not guarantee environmental improvements if it is not specifically designed with this purpose. \{PSS\} design process models can play a relevant role in supporting companies in designing sustainable \{PSS\} when they incorporate activities, methods and tools to approach the sustainability dimensions. Not only the process models, but also the intentions of practitioners and their awareness towards sustainability during the design of a \{PSS\} influence the dissemination of sustainable PSS. The objective of this work is to investigate whether the existent \{PSS\} design process models support the design of sustainable \{PSS\} and whether practitioners employ sustainability-related activities when designing PSS. Nine process models were analyzed and the perspective of practitioners about considering sustainability issues when designing \{PSS\} were captured. The collected data shows that only few of the analyzed process models actually propose activities, methods or tools to support a sustainable \{PSS\} design. This suggests an existing gap between literature and the practitioners’ expectations of \{PSS\} design process models.

In this context, this paper proposes a novel concept of Universal Intelligent Small Cell (UnISCell) for enabling the densification of the next generation of cellular networks. The proposed novel concept envisions an integrated platform of providing a strong linkage between different stakeholders such as street lighting networks, landline telephone networks and future wireless networks, and is universal in nature being independent of the operating frequency bands and traffic types. The main motivating factors for the proposed small cell concept are the need of public infrastructure re-engineering, and the recent advances in several enabling technologies. First, we highlight the main concepts of the proposed UnISCell platform. Subsequently, we present two deployment scenarios for the proposed UnISCell concept considering infrastructure sharing and service sharing as important aspects. We then describe the key future technologies for enabling the proposed UnISCell concept and present a use case example with the help of numerical results.

Such a change will have important benefits in the access to near real- time, large- scale up to population-wide data collection and analysis. However, there are numerous issues implied. Primarily of concern is how to ensure anonymity and privacy within these methodologies, and further the related issue of how to incentivize participants and remove barriers/concerns over participation. To address these concerns, in this paper we introduce a novel system to capture aggregate population health research data via utilizing smartphone capabilities while fully maintaining the anonymity and privacy of each individual contributing such data. A key and novel capability of this system is the support for customizable data collection; without the need to know specific details about an individual. The customized collection rules can be deployed on the local device based on detailed local data, and the resultant collection can be measured by the anonymous data collection network. In this paper we provide a conceptual architecture and describe a method for local processing of aggregate e-Research health data utilizing adaptive privacy thresholds to create a multi-party flexible approach to participatory data submission to support this novel health e-Research capability.

abstract = "Abstract Multivariate time series classification has been broadly applied in diverse domains over the past few decades. However, before applying the classification algorithms, the vast majority of current studies extract hand-engineered features that are assumed to detect local patterns in the time series. Therefore, the efficiency and precision of these classification approaches are heavily dependent on the quality of variables defined by domain experts. Recent improvements in the deep learning domain offer opportunities to avoid such an intensive hand-crafted feature engineering which is particularly important for managing the processes based on time-series data obtained from various sensor networks. In our paper, we propose a framework to extract the features in an unsupervised (or self-supervised) manner using deep learning, particularly stacked \{LSTM\} Autoencoder Networks. The compressed representation of the time-series data obtained from \{LSTM\} Autoencoders are then provided to Deep Feedforward Neural Networks for classification. We apply the proposed framework on sensor time series data from the process industry to detect the quality of the semi-finished products and accordingly predict the next production process step. To validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we used real-world data from the steel industry. "

Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 30 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the recordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difficult to make in the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier. "

An additional challenge is the instantiation of a proven methodology for data privacy preservation and authentication of users. \{SIMON\} builds on existing mobility services, using the current infrastructure of the cities, and adds the required integration work to provide a seamless services integration layer which can be instantiated in different cities according to the specific context and the services available. Thus, from an \{ICT\} point of view, \{SIMON\} services are adaptable to heterogeneous environment, with different capabilities. The \{SIMON\} system platform supports some services that feed different applications, all of them accessible through different mobile devices.

Firstly to identify, and secondly to fulfil the citizens’ continuously changing needs. One of the easiest methods to help understand the residents’ needs can be crowdsourcing usage. However the most challenging area of responsibility is to manage traffic by the city logistics infrastructure designed to eliminate congestion problems within existing city spatial and, at the same time, to flexibly reply on transport changing demands.

In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of \{IURVs\} with different forms. Five case studies are presented of \{IURVs\} in the countries with the largest number of \{IURVs\} involving \{US\} universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of \{IURVs\} depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the \{IURV\} in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved. "

abstract = "Abstract The telecommunications sector is going through an interesting phase in its evolution. Cellular mobile service providers have been at the root of the massive expansion in the number of subscribers and usage. Since last year the pace of growth has slowed down and it is increasingly clear that revenues from voice services alone will not be sufficient. The action has now moved to data. In fact, mobile service providers have seen a rapid increase in their revenues from data. Data, however, is more complex than voice. The key challenges are explored here. "

abstract = "Abstract Emergence and evolution of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) opened the door for the development of many applications. Mobile Wireless Sensors Networks (MWSNs) is a subclass of \{WSNs\} in which some or all sensors are mobile. Although such mobility has benefits for extending network coverage, the existence of nodes mobility imposes challenges in the data delivery process as connectivity changes dynamically. This issue is exacerbated when nodes move in uncontrollable manner, e.g. mounted on helmets of factory workers or on vehicles. Existing \{WSNs\} routing protocols are mainly designed to support static or semi-dynamic scenarios. Due to the similarity between \{MWSNs\} and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), existing \{MANET\} routing protocols can be used for this purpose. In this paper, we use ns2 to evaluate the performance of two \{MANET\} routing protocols, \{GPSR\} and AOMDV, in the field of \{MWSNs\} with a location-based sensing application assuming the nodes move in an uncontrollable manner. We use metrics such as packet delivery ratio, routing overhead, hop count, and energy consumption to test protocols performance. We also use a utility function to estimate the performance of the application. We find that the geographic-based routing, GPSR, works better than \{AOMDV\} due to its lower routing protocol overhead.
