abstract = "Abstract Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.

However, the number of advanced IoT-based continuous glucose monitoring systems is small and the existing systems have several limitations. In this paper we study feasibility of invasive and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system utilizing IoT based approach. We designed an IoT-based system architecture from a sensor device to a back-end system for presenting real-time glucose, body temperature and contextual data (i.e. environmental temperature) in graphical and human-readable forms to end-users such as patients and doctors. In addition, nRF communication protocol is customized for suiting to the glucose monitoring system and achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate energy consumption of the sensor device and design energy harvesting units for the device. Finally, the work provides many advanced services at a gateway level such as a push notification service for notifying patient and doctors in case of abnormal situations (i.e. too low or too high glucose level). The results show that our system is able to achieve continuous glucose monitoring remotely in real-time. In addition, the results reveal that a high level of energy efficiency can be achieved by applying the customized nRF component, the power management unit and the energy harvesting unit altogether in the sensor device.

This point is further reinforced by the proposed ‘Privacy by Design’ requirements associated with the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This paper proposes some practical approaches which should be considered when designing and developing IoT for data collection and data sharing within the health domain. "

The low cost and reduced size of sensor device, support of IoTs, and recent flipped learning advancements can enhance medical students' academic and practical experiences.

Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art \{PPDA\} techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of \{PPDA\} techniques. "

This new form of computing environment is known as the “Internet-of-Things” (IoT). The adoption of IoT is fast and the “things” are becoming integral part of people day-to-day life as well as essential elements in the businesses everyday activities and processes. Open characteristics of IoT environments raises privacy concern as “things” are autonomous with some degree of authority to sharing their capabilities and knowledge to fulfil their individual or collective tasks. As such privacy becomes central and an inherit computational aspect of the “things”. The work presented here is based on modelling IoT as Cooperative Distributed Systems (CDS).

In real time, it delivers information about the gaze position, where a designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to catch the intention of user. After that, it is able to trigger a special service that the patient expects. The service embedded in the patient bed include the complicated positioning control and the call for a nurse. In addition, this patient bed is innovatively made of composite materials: carbon fibers to reduce the total weight for saving electricity and reduce the burden of transportation or positioning.

This paper introduces a flexible and scalable approach that enhances modifiability and programmability through client-server-server-client architecture. It allows changing the behavior of the system after deployment through a lightweight script written with a domain specific language, DoS-IL, and stored in a gateway at the fog layer. An embedded resource browser is used to request and execute the script. The results of analysis for this model and the tools developed along the way are discussed. "

Information retrieved from such an object, turns it into a potential smart object, certainly able to auto identify itself and, if security problems are suitably treated, most probably able to connect to the global Internet. This way, one can get an ubiquitous framework to access, monitor and control any of those smart objects over an Internet of connected things. \{RFID\} tags in medical context enable a rapid and precise identification of each smart entity, enabling a ubiquitous and quick access to Personal Health Records over an Internet of Things. The use of smart phones with Internet access, along with strong security concerns - such as authenticity, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, entity authentication and non-repudiation - turn this whole context into a decentralized and mobile healthcare system.

The functionality can be encapsulated as services and the task executed by composing the services. Two noteworthy functionalities of IoT services are monitoring and actuation. Monitoring implies continuous executions, and actuation is by triggering. Continuous executions typically involve stream processing. Stream input data are accumulated into batches and each batch is subjected to a sequence of computations, structured as a dataflow graph. The composition may be processing several batches simultaneously. Additionally, some non-stream \{OLTP\} transactions may also be executing concurrently. Thus, several composite transactions may be executing concurrently. This is in contrast to a typical Web services composition, where just one composite transaction is executed on each invocation. Therefore, defining transactional properties for executions of IoT service compositions is much more complex than for those of conventional Web service compositions. In this paper, we propose a transaction model and a correctness criterion for executions of IoT service compositions. Our proposal defines relaxed atomicity and isolation properties for transactions in a flexible manner and can be adapted for a variety of IoT applications. "

As the numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume of data published will increase. Internet-connected devices technology, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet by providing connectivity and interaction between the physical and cyber worlds. In addition to increased volume, the IoT generates Big Data characterized by velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this Big Data is the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses the different machine learning methods that deal with the challenges in IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case.

The IoT demands for smart, integrated, miniaturised and low-energy wireless nodes, typically powered by non-renewable energy storage units (batteries). The latter aspect poses constraints as batteries have a limited lifetime and often their replacement is impracticable. Availability of zero-power energy-autonomous technologies, able to harvest (i.e. convert) and store part of the energy available in the surrounding environment (vibrations, thermal gradients, electromagnetic waves) into electricity to supply wireless nodes functionality, would fill a significant part of the technology gap limiting the wide diffusion of efficient and cost effective IoT applications. Given the just depicted scenario, the realisation of miniaturised Energy Harvesters (EHs) leveraging on \{MEMS\} technology (MicroElectroMechanical-Systems), i.e. EH-MEMS, seems to be a key-enabling solution able to conjugate both main driving requirements of IoT applications, namely, energy-autonomy and miniaturisation/integration. This short review outlines the current state of the art in the field of EH-MEMS, with a specific focus on vibration EHs, i.e. converters capable to convert the mechanical energy scattered in environmental vibrations, into electric power. In particular, the issues in terms of conversion performance arising from \{EHs\} scaling down, along with the challenge to extend their operability on a frequency range of vibrations as wider as possible, are going to be discussed in the following.

The demand-side management (DSM) of energy systems has drawn considerable industrial and academic attention in attempts to form new flexibilities to respond to variations in renewable energy inputs to the system. However, many \{DSM\} concepts are still in the experimental demonstration phase. One of the obstacles to \{DSM\} usage is that the current information infrastructure was mainly designed for centralized systems, and does not meet \{DSM\} requirements. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a novel information infrastructure named the Internet of Energy Things (IoET) in order to make \{DSM\} practicable by basing it on the latest wireless communication technology: the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The primary advantage of \{LPWAN\} over general packet radio service (GPRS) and area Internet of Things (IoT) is its wide-area coverage, which comes with minimum power consumption and maintenance costs. Against this background, this paper briefly reviews the representative \{LPWAN\} technologies of narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Range (LoRa) technology, and compares them with \{GPRS\} and area IoT technology. Next, a wireless-to-cloud architecture is proposed for the IoET, based on the main technical features of LPWAN. Finally, this paper looks forward to the potential of IoET in various \{DSM\} application scenarios. "

It thus enables companies to cope with the challenges of producing increasingly individualized products with a short lead-time to market and higher quality. Intelligent manufacturing plays an important role in Industry 4.0. Typical resources are converted into intelligent objects so that they are able to sense, act, and behave within a smart environment. In order to fully understand intelligent manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper provides a comprehensive review of associated topics such as intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled manufacturing, and cloud manufacturing. Similarities and differences in these topics are highlighted based on our analysis. We also review key technologies such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, big data analytics (BDA), and information and communications technology (ICT) that are used to enable intelligent manufacturing. Next, we describe worldwide movements in intelligent manufacturing, including governmental strategic plans from different countries and strategic plans from major international companies in the European Union, United States, Japan, and China. Finally, we present current challenges and future research directions.

Conducting a complete threat assessment for each such configuration changes is infeasible.

Because the traditional healthcare mode is passive, by which patients call the healthcare service by themselves. Consequently, they usually fail to call the service if they are unconscious when the heart disease attacks. The Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have overwhelming superiority in solving the problem of heart diseases patients care as they can change the service mode into a pervasive way, and trigger the healthcare service based on patients’ physical status rather than their feelings. In order to realize the pervasive healthcare service, a remote monitoring system is essential. In this paper, we proposed a pervasive monitoring system that can send patients’ physical signs to remote medical applications in real time. The system is mainly composed of two parts: the data acquisition part and the data transmission part. The monitoring scheme (monitoring parameters and frequency for each parameter) is the key point of the data acquisition part, and we designed it based on interviews to medical experts. Multiple physical signs (blood pressure, ECG, SpO2, heart rate, pulse rate, blood fat and blood glucose) as well as an environmental indicator (patients’ location) are designed to be sampled at different rates continuously. Four data transmission modes are presented taking patients’ risk, medical analysis needs, demands for communication and computing resources into consideration. Finally, a sample prototype is implemented to present an overview of the system. "

As air pollution being a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings that need to be controlled.

This methodology gave us the monitoring data from the stationary nodes deployed in the city to the mobile nodes on Public Transport buses and cars. The data of the air pollution particles such as gases, smoke and other pollutants is collected via sensors on the Public transport buses and the data is being analyzed when the buses and cars reach back to the source destination after passing through the stationary nodes around the city. Our proposed architecture having innovative mesh network will be more efficient way of gathering data from the nodes of WSN. It will have lots of benefits with respect to the future concept of Smart Cities that will have the new technologies related to Internet of Things. "

In order to achieve semantic interoperability in smart homes we have developed Smart Home Ontology, which gives semantics for the data that are exchanged by the systems and devices in a smart home. From technology point of view, we have studied the combination of cloud computing and Internet of Things as they enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual “things”, thus stimulating innovations in both fields.

However, major challenges arise mainly in terms of the interoperability among several heterogeneous devices from a variety of manufacturers.

This platform is able to integrate information obtained from heterogeneous sensors in order to provide mechanisms to monitor, process, visualize, store, and send notifications regarding patients’ conditions and vital signs at real-time by using Internet standards.

In current systems more and more data is generated from day to day and has to be evaluated to be helpful. For many tasks only a certain part of the general information flow is relevant. An information demand analysis can help reducing big data to smart data and identifying possible context key factors. Using such factors information can be categorized and provided when the context is right. This article shows the interpretation of several information demand analysis as well as the development of a demonstrator application for context related information provision based on the findings.

To make the components of the systems act intelligently, according to users’ needs, and understand and predict behavior of the cyber-physical systems, the cyber-physical systems need reasoning to link the outcome of the different components to be able to make use of the devices in the surrounding environment. The reasoning includes collecting sensor data, finding key concepts in the data and drawing conclusions that cyber-physical systems can use to control the components surrounding the users. However, there is a range of different components in a system where each has particular communication input-output and its own set tasks, which provides particular challenges associated with controlling or predicting the behavior of such systems, which require a kind of analytic tools. This paper presents reasoning strategies for smart cyber-physical systems that can extract and combine data, information, and knowledge to provide an intelligent behavior from users point of view. The reasoning strategies use users’ needs as a starting point and provide an environment that gives personalized support. "

In particular, the advent of low- cost and low-power transceivers, together with the development of compact-size and open standard stacks, have made possible Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), largely adopted for both home/office and industrial monitoring applications. The nowadays ambitious goal is to sample, collect and analyze every piece of information around us, in order to improve production efficiency and ensure optimal resource consumption. The “Internet of Things” (IoT), i.e. the capability of connecting every possible device to the World Wide Web, is the practical answer to this request. The very large amount of information that is consequently generated could be profitably handled using “cloud” services, i.e. flexible and powerful hardware/software frameworks capable to deliver computing as a service. The aim of this work is to resume pros and cons of well-accepted \{WSN\} technologies, suggesting their possible extension towards already available cloud services. "

In this paper, we propose the design tasks of the Remote Healthcare Monitoring application for handling concurrency tasks. In the procedure of designing tasks, concurrency is best understood by employing multiple levels of abstraction. The way that is eminently to accomplish concurrency is to build an object-oriented environment with support for messages passing between concurrent objects. Node.js, a cross-platform runtime environment features technologies for handling concurrency issue efficiently for Remote Healthcare Monitoring System. The experiments results show that server-side JavaScript with Node.js and MongoDB as database is 40% faster than Apache Sling. With Node.js developers can build a high-performance, asynchronous, event-driven healthcare hub server to handle an increasing number of concurrent connections for Remote Healthcare Monitoring System in an isolated village with no access to local medical care.

At the \{MAC\} level, the \{IEEE\} 802.15.4 standard defines a reservation mechanism called Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) that uses a first-come first-served service policy, which is not enough to ensure the real-time delivery of packets. In this work, we present a formal definition of the scheduling problem for a sensor network using a reservation mechanism (such as GTS) that provides guarantees for the real-time delivery of packets. We also present a heuristic approach for finding feasible schedules when possible or determining if the requirements of a set of sensors are not feasible. "

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation. "

These emerge from innovations in information technology that, while they create new economic and social opportunities, pose challenges to our security and expectations of privacy. Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and private, will access a web of interconnected data from \{GPS\} location to weather and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges. Their implementation is essential for a Smart City in which we would wish to live. We also present a model representing the interactions between person, servers and things. Those are the major element in the Smart City and their interactions are what we need to protect. "

This lack of clarity and understanding presents a challenge to both research and practice. The paper asks what the points of convergence and divergence are between the two streams of literature. The extant literature is reviewed to identify and understand where and how the streams converge and diverge. A two-tiered thematic analysis with both semantic and latent theme analysis is employed. Our findings highlight five points of departure, as well as highlighting examples where both logics have been applied. The five points of departure are the differing conceptualisations of: Value-in-Use, Design of the Servitized Offering, Value Co-production and Value Co-creation, Contextual Variety and Complexity, and Business Model of Solutions and Outcomes. We also propose conditions under which one logic may be more appropriate, in particular we find that adoption of a goods-dominant logic and service-dominant logic are better suited to the pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness, respectively.

In this paper, we highlight relevant security concerns related to ZigBee security features, then we propose a new approach suitable for ZigBee enabled wireless sensor networks. The proposed solution decreases considerably the likelihood of successful attacks,and reduces security impact in the event of a node compromise. Lastly we discuss the security and performance related to the proposed scheme. "

Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based \{DTLS\} handshake protocol as it is the main \{IP\} security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a \{TI\} SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The \{CC2538\} module integrated into the \{TI\} board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.

The present research assessed the potential effect of \{AM\} on the global energy demand in four energy scenarios for 2050 with extended versus limited globalisation and limited versus extensive adoption of AM. These scenarios were developed and applied for two cases, namely the aerospace sector and the construction sector, analysing the effect of \{AM\} on each phase in the value chain. In the aerospace sector, energy savings of 5–25% can be made, with the largest effect in the use phase because of weight reduction. In the construction sector, energy savings of 4–21% are achievable, with the largest effects in the feedstock, transport and use phases. Extrapolated to the global energy demand in 2050, a reduction of 26–138 EJ/yr, equivalent to 5–27% of global demand is achievable. It is recommended that energy policymakers should consider integrating \{AM\} and other disruptive technologies, such as robotics and the Internet of Things, into their long-term energy planning, policies and programmes, including Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Nanogenerators were first developed for self-powered systems based on piezoelectric effect and triboelectrification effect for converting tiny mechanical energy into electricity, which have applications in internet of things, environmental/infrastructural monitoring, medical science and security. In this paper, we present the fundamental theory of the nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations. In the Maxwell's displacement current, the first term ε 0 ∂ E ∂ t gives the birth of electromagnetic wave, which is the foundation of wireless communication, radar and later the information technology. Our study indicates that the second term ∂ P ∂ t in the Maxwell's displacement current is directly related to the output electric current of the nanogenerator, meaning that our nanogenerators are the applications of Maxwell's displacement current in energy and sensors. By contrast, electromagnetic generators are built based on Lorentz force driven flow of free electrons in a conductor. This study presents the similarity and differences between pieozoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, as well as the classical electromagnetic generator, so that the impact and uniqueness of the nanogenerators can be clearly understood. We also present the three major applications of nanogenerators as micro/nano-power source, self-powered sensors and blue energy. "

An insecure communication channel between a tag and a reader makes the \{RFID\} implant system vulnerable to attacks and endangers the user's safety and privacy. The proposed scheme relies on elliptic curve cryptography and the D-Quark lightweight hash design. Compared to the available public-key cryptosystems, elliptic curve-based cryptosystems are the best choice due to their small key sizes as well as their efficiency in computations. The D-Quark lightweight hash design is tailored for resource constrained pervasive devices, cost, and performance. The security analysis of the proposed authentication scheme revealed that it is secure against the relevant threat models and provides a higher security level than related work found in the literature. The computational performance comparison shows that our work has 48% less communication overhead compared to existing similar schemes. It also requires 24% less total memory than the other approaches. The required computational time of our scheme is generally similar to other existing schemes. Hence, the presented scheme is a well-suited choice for providing security for the resource-constrained \{RFID\} implant systems. "

Sport Internet of Things (IoTs) based on the sensor technique and modern communication technology are becoming more and more important to current sport training and daily activities. Sensor-based sport monitoring approaches lead people to take advantage of the wearable sport devices to monitor their own physiological parameters, in which we will focus on the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse measurement. In order to measure these two parameters, we will adopt near-infrared portable tissue oximeter with detection module using \{STM32\} microprocessor. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is becoming a widely used research instrument to measure tissue oxygen (O2) status non-invasively. Continuous-wave spectrometers are the most commonly used devices, which provide semi-quantitative changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in small blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries and venules). Through the measurement using the near-infrared technology, we could obtain the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse parameters. After obtaining the above two parameters, the portable device will send the data to the remote coaches or doctors via GPRS/WiFi/Zigbee networks. The data of the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse that is detected by the detection module are processed by the expert decision-making system in order to provide the coaches and doctors with the athlete condition. In addition, the data can be sent to the smart phones of the players, coaches or doctors through GPRS/WiFi networks, in which the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse data of the athletes can be displayed according to the requirement of the remote users. The test results show that the accuracy of measurement is high and the system is stable. "

Although cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, cyberwars are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective. "

Yet there are many technical and commercial challenges which question the future of peer-assisted solutions in industrial settings. This includes among others unreliability of peer-to-peer networks, the lack of incentives for peers’ participation, and copyright issues. In this paper, we carefully review and systematize this ongoing debate around the future of peer-assisted networks and propose a novel taxonomy to characterize the research and industrial efforts in the area. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the last decade in the peer-assisted content delivery research and devise a novel taxonomy to characterize the identified challenges and the respective proposed solutions in the literature. Our survey includes a thorough review of the three very large scale feasibility studies conducted for \{BBC\} iPlayer, \{MSN\} Video and Conviva, five large commercial peer-assisted \{CDNs\} - Kankan, LiveSky, Akamai NetSession, Spotify, Tudou - and a vast scope of technical papers. We focus both on technical challenges in deploying peer-assisted solutions and also on non-technical challenges caused due to heterogeneity in user access patterns and distribution of resources among users as well as commercial feasibility related challenges attributed to the necessity of accounting for the interests and incentives of Internet Service Providers, End-Users and Content Providers. The results of our study suggest that many of technical challenges for implementing peer-assisted content delivery networks on an industrial scale have been already addressed in the literature, whereas a problem of finding economically viable solutions to incentivize participation in peer-assisted schemes remains an open issue to a large extent. Furthermore, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable expansion of conventional \{CDNs\} to a broader network of connected devices through machine to machine communication. "

abstract = "Abstract We define personal risk detection as the timely identification of when someone is in the midst of a dangerous situation, for example, a health crisis or a car accident, events that may jeopardize a person’s physical integrity. We work under the hypothesis that a risk-prone situation produces sudden and significant deviations in standard physiological and behavioural user patterns. These changes can be captured by a group of sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate. We introduce a dataset, called PRIDE, which provides a baseline for the development and the fair comparison of personal risk detection mechanisms. \{PRIDE\} contains information on 18 test subjects; for each subject, it includes partial information about the user’s behavioural and physiological patterns, as captured by Microsoft Band©. \{PRIDE\} test subject records include sensor readings of not only when a subject is carrying out ordinary daily life activities, but also when exposed to a stressful scenario, thereby simulating a dangerous or abnormal situation. We show how to use \{PRIDE\} to develop a personal risk detection mechanism; to accomplish this, we have tackled risk detection as a one-class classification problem. We have trained several classifiers based only on the daily behaviour of test subjects. Further, we tested the accuracy of the classifiers to detect anomalies that were not included in the training process of the classifiers. We used a number of one-class classifiers, namely: SVM, Parzen, and two versions of Parzen based on k-means. While there is still room for improvement, our results are encouraging: they support our hypothesis that abnormal behaviour can be automatically detected. "

In many cases, consumers may have incomplete information or may be inattentive about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy policies, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers’ privacy actions and attitudes. Results of an online survey experiment indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing sensitive and identifiable information, even when positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy are made salient, compared to when privacy is not mentioned. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information. Rather, people are inattentive and their dormant privacy concerns may manifest only when consumers are asked to think about privacy. "

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of \{BDA\} tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly \{BD\} tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the \{BDA\} landscape. Given the significant nature of the \{BD\} and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the \{BD\} challenges and \{BDA\} methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on \{BD\} and \{BDA\} area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: \{Q1\} – What are the different types of \{BD\} challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and \{Q2\} – What are the different types of \{BDA\} methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome \{BD\} challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the \{BDA\} research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of \{BD\} strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant \{BD\} research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the \{BDA\} in technology and organizational resource management discipline.

In the context of big data, the success of healthcare applications solely depends on the underlying architecture and utilization of appropriate tools as evidenced in pioneering research attempts. Novel research works have been carried out for deriving application specific healthcare frameworks that offer diversified data analytical capabilities for handling sources of data ranging from electronic health records to medical images. In this paper, we have presented various analytical avenues that exist in the patient-centric healthcare system from the perspective of various stakeholders. We have also reviewed various big data frameworks with respect to underlying data sources, analytical capability and application areas.

In light of the increasingly blurred lines among different categories of testing, I call for a broader discussion of \{DTC\} governance. I stress the importance of shifting our attention from the activities of the most prominent companies to viewing \{DTC\} genetics as an industry with a wide spectrum of services and raising a wide variety of issues. These issues go beyond questions of clinical utility and validity to those of data security, personal identity, race, and the nature of the family. Robust \{DTC\} testing has the power to provide meaningful clinical, genealogical and even forensic information to those who want it; in unscrupulous hands, however, it also has the power to deceive and exploit. I consider approaches to help ensure the former and minimize the latter. "

Additionally, the huge amount of connected objects embeds with resource-constrained devices (sensors, actuators, RFIDS, etc.) are also challenging. Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology. The second contribution is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of this ontology. In fact, an IoT Medicare system is proposed to evaluate the HealthIoT ontology. "

Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification \{RFID\} scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.

In departing from the traditional centralized model of manufacturing, decentralized manufacturing divides production across sites or geographic regions. This paradigm shift imposes significant structural and organisational changes on a business presenting both hidden challenges that must be addressed and opportunities to be embraced. By profoundly adapting business practices, significant advantages can be realized through a democratized value chain, creation of professional-level jobs without geographic restriction to the central hub and a flexibility in response to external pressures and demands. To realize these potential opportunities, however, advances in manufacturing technology and support systems are required, as well as significant changes in the way \{CGTs\} are regulated to facilitate multi-site manufacturing. Decentralized manufacturing is likely to be the manufacturing platform of choice for advanced health care therapies—in particular, those with a high degree of personalization. The future success of these promising products will be enhanced by adopting sound business strategies early in development. To realize the benefits that decentralized manufacturing of \{CGTs\} has to offer, it is important to examine both the risks and the substantial opportunities present. In this research, we examine both the challenges and the opportunities this shift in business strategy represents in an effort to maximize the success of adoption. "

To support this work, we introduce two classes of metrics: a set of three tracking performance metrics, and a set of three network efficiency metrics. The results of our experiments show that the proposed distributed system adapts readily to changes in the sensing environment, but this higher level of adaptability is at the cost of overall efficiency.

The differences between city intelligence in China and the “smart city” concept in other countries are compared to highlight and contrast the unique definition and model for China's city intelligence in this paper. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of urban big data in city intelligence by showing that it not only serves as the cornerstone of this trend as it also plays a core role in the diffusion of city intelligence technology and serves as an inexhaustible resource for the sustained development of city intelligence. This study also points out the challenges of shaping and developing of China's urban big data. Considering the supporting and core role that urban big data plays in city intelligence, the study then expounds on the key points of urban big data, including infrastructure support, urban governance, public services, and economic and industrial development. Finally, this study points out that the utility of city intelligence as an ideal policy tool for advancing the goals of China's urban development. In conclusion, it is imperative that China make full use of its unique advantages—including using the nation's current state of development and resources, geographical advantages, and good human relations—in subjective and objective conditions to promote the development of city intelligence through the proper application of urban big data.

Systematic performance management of healthcare processes is important in determining if quality of care goals are being met at all levels of the healthcare ecosystem. The challenge is that reaching these goals requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system. In this paper, we review various cloud computing applications for surveillance and performance management of quality of care in healthcare. We also introduce a framework for achieving systematic surveillance and performance management across the entire healthcare system. "

Our work introduces a mechanism that greatly improves the operation of actuating objects over wireless links of varying quality. The proposed approach successfully compensates for communications impairments by tracking the system state and deciding course of action based on probabilistic principles. We tested our proposal using an experimental testbed consisting of an unmanned small-scale vehicle and present experimental results obtained through an extensive human subject based study. Our results show how the proposed mechanism significantly compensates for channel impairments aiding in the completion of a variety of basic tasks. "

However, the application of regulatory bioinformatics also poses new challenges and requires new knowledge and skill sets. In the latest Global Coalition on Regulatory Science Research (GCRSR) governed conference, Global Summit on Regulatory Science (GSRS2015), regulatory bioinformatics principles were presented with respect to global trends, initiatives and case studies. The discussion revealed that datasets, analytical tools, skills and expertise are rapidly developing, in many cases via large international collaborative consortia. It also revealed that significant research is still required to realize the potential applications of regulatory bioinformatics. While there is significant excitement in the possibilities offered by precision medicine to enhance treatments of serious and/or complex diseases, there is a clear need for further development of mechanisms to securely store, curate and share data, integrate databases, and standardized quality control and data analysis procedures. A greater understanding of the biological significance of the data is also required to fully exploit vast datasets that are becoming available. The application of bioinformatics in the microbiological risk analysis paradigm is delivering clear benefits both for the investigation of food borne pathogens and for decision making on clinically important treatments. It is recognized that regulatory bioinformatics will have many beneficial applications by ensuring high quality data, validated tools and standardized processes, which will help inform the regulatory science community of the requirements necessary to ensure the safe introduction and effective use of these applications.

In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare. The context broker that is presented in this paper addresses some critical healthcare issues: availability, cost and quality. This broker is for general and specialised healthcare needs in specific medical fields, and it is especially useful in emergency situations. It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria. The context broker collects queries from users (patients or their dependents), and refers them to the best and most affordable hospitals on the basis of their geographical location, financial status, quality of care and the availability of the requested medical services at the time their request is made.

In mobile pervasive systems devices come and go, and switch network frequently, demanding support for device discovery across heterogeneous networks. We present the design of a device discovery mechanism for the PalCom middleware that eliminates the need for cross-network periodic keep-alive messages while still supporting timely detection of missing devices, i.e. undiscovery. The design has been implemented and is evaluated against the simplistic approach of flooding the inter-connected networks with keep-alive messages. "

Water quality monitoring has thus become essential to the supply of clean and safe water. Conventional monitoring processes involve manual collection of samples from various points in the distribution network, followed by laboratory testing and analysis. This process has proved to be ineffective since it is laborious, time consuming and lacks real-time results to promote proactive response to water contamination. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have since been considered a promising alternative to complement conventional monitoring processes. These networks are relatively affordable and allow measurements to be taken remotely, in real-time and with minimal human intervention. This work surveys the application of \{WSN\} in environmental monitoring, with particular emphasis on water quality. Various \{WSN\} based water quality monitoring methods suggested by other authors are studied and analyzed, taking into account their coverage, energy and security concerns. The work also compares and evaluates sensor node architectures proposed the various authors in terms of monitored parameters, microcontroller/microprocessor units (MCU) and wireless communication standards adopted, localization, data security implementation, power supply architectures, autonomy and potential application scenarios.

We therefore propose “Virtual Big Room”, where the concept of collocation of workers will be deployed through virtual technologies. A combination of product and process modelling techniques along with communication and social network tools are proposed to develop the proposed platform that will integrate the entire supply chain through the project lifecycle (i.e. design, construction, handover).

The first \{PRN\} sequence is used for permuting the plain image whereas the second \{PRN\} sequence is used for generating random \{DNA\} sequence.

Nowadays, injection therapy of bio-manufactured drugs is routine practice for chronic diseases but remains constraining and painful. New emerging advanced therapies invest in genetic, electronics and cell-based therapy for addressing unmet needs for the caregivers and the patient. As digital process in health (eHealth) gains momentum, connected advanced bio-electronic devices now offer new strategies for personalized injection therapies. In this review, we take a journey along the genesis path of a new drug delivery system: the Optogenerapy, a synergy between optogenetic and gene therapy. Inside a bio-electronic implant, electronics and optogenetics are interfaced by light as a traceless inducer signal. By controlling a synthetic optogenetic pathway in the cell, therapeutics delivery can be fine-tuned with a precise spatiotemporal control. The technology holds promise of a new modern syringe era capable of producing a drug of interest at will directly inside the patient. "

Objectives In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25 years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges. Discussion Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis. Conclusions Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.

In order to lead data-driven innovations, a market of data is expected to reduce the risks of data utilization, and encourage data exchange. Data Jacket (DJ) has been proposed as the technique for sharing the information about data by publishing the summary of datasets as meta-data. Even if the data itself is not open in public, \{DJs\} enable the stakeholders in the market of data to consider the latent value of datasets by understanding the information about data described on DJs. Datasets described in \{DJs\} have various sharing policies of data, such as Open Data from governments, or private data from companies or individuals. Although, in general, there is a preconception that “the fee-charging things are better than the free ones”, the relationship of sharing policies and the utility expectations of data has not discussed in the market of data. In this study, we examine which data is expected higher for utilizing, that is, comparing the utility expectation of the data which can be shared in public (Public Data) and the data which cannot be shared (Private Data). Observing the frequency of uses in Innovators Marketplace on Data Jackets, which is the gamified workshop for discussing the data utilization, and analyzing the number of views in \{DJ\} Store, which is the retrieval system of DJs, the result shows that the data which is hardly open may be recognized valuable for utilizing.

Unlike hard computing, soft computing is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximations. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the human mind. Soft computing is based on techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, machine learning, and expert systems. Although soft computing theory and techniques were first introduced in 1980s, it has now become a major research and study area in automatic control engineering. The techniques of soft computing are nowadays being used successfully in many domestic, commercial, and industrial applications. With the advent of the low-cost and very high performance digital processors and the reduction of the cost of memory chips it is clear that the techniques and application areas of soft computing will continue to expand. This paper gives an overview of the current state of soft computing techniques and describes the advantages and disadvantages of soft computing compared to traditional hard computing techniques. "

Primitive security techniques like signature-based detection of malware and regular update of signature database are not feasible solutions as they cannot secure such systems, having limited resources, effectively. Furthermore, energy efficient wireless sensor modes running on batteries cannot afford the implementation of cryptography algorithms as such techniques have significant impact on the system power consumption. Therefore, in order to operate wireless embedded devices in a secure manner, the system must be able to detect and prevent any kind of intrusions before the network (i.e. sensor nodes and base station) is destabilized by the attackers. In this paper, we have presented an intrusion detection mechanism by implementing an intelligent security architecture using Random Neural Networks (RNN). To validate the feasibility of the proposed security solution, it is implemented for an existing wireless sensor network system and its functionality is practically demonstrated by successfully detecting the presence of any suspicious sensor node and anomalous activity in the base station with high accuracy and minimal performance overhead.

The algorithm devised for the extraction of the features are Texton based contour gradient extraction algorithm, Intrinsic pattern extraction algorithm and modified shift invariant feature transformation algorithm. In the second phase to identify the potential feature vector \{GA\} based feature selection is done, using a hybrid approach of “Branch and Bound Algorithm” and “Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm” using the breast cancer, Brain tumour and thyroid images. The Chi Square distance measurement is used to assess the similarity between query images and database images. A fitness function with respect Minimum description length principle were used as initial requirement for genetic algorithm. In the third phase to improve the performance of the hybrid content based medical image retrieval system diverse density based relevance feedback method is used. The term hybrid is used as this system can be used to retrieve any kind of medical image such as breast cancer, brain tumour, lung cancer, thyroid cancer and so on. This machine learning based feature selection method is used to reduce the existing system dimensionality problem. The experimental result shows that the \{GA\} driven image retrieval system selects optimal subset of feature to identify the right set of images. "

An illustration of the method advantages is the additional objective. Method The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a way of trend and seasonality extraction. \{SSA\} is suitable for short series with noises. It is also useful for the variability analysis. As well, it is simply programmable in a high-level programming language. Here Maple 18 was in use. Results Trends and the slowest oscillations were obtained within a case study. The error of \{SSA\} estimations turned out to be close to the exactness of measuring. However, these errors are in good agreement with the known descriptors of the short-time variability. The periods of the slowest oscillations were different for the systolic and the diastolic pressures. Seasonality was about six months and about two months respectively. We found the amplitude of the slowest oscillations of heart rate varies in time. This fact is in contrast to the blood pressure fluctuations, for which the amplitudes are stable. Conclusions \{SSA\} is a promising tool for \{HBPM\} data processing. It ensures smooth and readable trends as well as shows the long-term variability of series. This information can be usable for clinical decision-making and prognostics. "

However, IoV can also be extended to healthcare domain, where the patients can be provided healthcare services on-the-fly. We extend this novel concept in this paper and refer it as “Healthcare services on-the-fly”. The concept of game theory has been used among the vehicles to access the healthcare services while traveling. The vehicles act as players in the game and tend to form and split coalitions to access these services. Learning automata (LA) act as the players for interaction with the environment and take appropriate actions based on reward and penalty. Apart from this, Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling algorithm for efficient utilization of resources at cloud level has also been formulated. A stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model is used to represent the coalition formation and splitting with respect to availability of resources at cloud level. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the best, first, and random fit schemes. "

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one of the cultural algorithms for solving many hard problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). \{ACO\} is a natural behaviour of ants, which work stochastically with the help of pheromone trails deposited in the shortest route to find their food. This optimization procedure involves adapting, positive feedback and inherent parallelism. Each ant will deposit certain amount of pheromone in the tour construction it makes searching for food. This type of communication is known as stigmetric communication. In addition, if a dense \{WBAN\} environment prevails, such as hospital, i.e. in the environment of overlapping WBAN, game formulation was introduced for analyzing the mixed strategy behaviour of WBAN. In this paper, the ant colony optimization approach to the travelling salesman problem was applied to the \{WBAN\} to determine the shortest route for sending emergency message to the doctor via sensor nodes; and also a static Bayesian game formulation with mixed strategy was analysed to enhance the network lifetime. Whenever the patient needs any critical care or any other medical issue arises, emergency messages will be created by the \{WBAN\} and sent to the doctor's destination. All the modes of communication were realized in a simulation environment using OMNet++. The authors investigated a balanced model of emergency message dissemination and network lifetime in \{WBAN\} using \{ACO\} and Bayesian game formulation. "

Accurate sensor orientation in 3D space were estimated using a computationally efficient gradient decent algorithm and were utilized to calculate joint angles, which were temporally aligned using curve registration to facilitate inter-participant comparisons.

An assessment of their perceptions and practice of cervical screening could reveal gaps that would inspire efforts to improve key indicators among them and in turn, the general population. Methods This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 316 workers of a tertiary health facility selected by stratified random sampling with proportionate allocation. Data was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires and analysed with \{SPSS\} 20 and \{PEPI\} programs. Results The majority of respondents were aware of cervical cancer but it was significantly higher among females, p=.001. Most respondents, 266 (84.2%) were less than 40 years of age but knowledge of cervical cancer screening diminished with increase in age, p=.039. Only 92 (29%) had good knowledge of cervical screening; a better knowledge of cervical screening was significantly associated with working in a clinical department, employment duration of less than 2 years, and being female. All females who had ever screened for Ca cervix, 18 (11%) had a Pap smear, and majority 15 (83%) had screened only once. Factors associated with screening were level of education, years of work experience, and being in a clinical department. Reasons given for not screening included pain from the procedure, its cost, and the delay with getting results. Conclusion Knowledge of cervical screening was not good among staff of \{DELSUTH\} and practice of screening was also very poor. They may benefit from health education and promotion programmes directed towards better screening practices. Introduction of easier-to-perform and less costly screening modalities like VIA/VILI may also improve uptake. "

The data collected from the patients transmitted through the network to the clinic or the doctor for a detailed diagnosis. Since healthcare applications are dealing with highly sensitive data, strong cryptographic algorithms should be incorporated for providing confidentiality. However, due to the computational and energy limitations of wireless devices we are forced to implement light weight ciphers which are computationally feasible in achieving confidentiality. This paper proposes a variant of hill cipher having two key matrices to add extra security to health related data. "

Health monitoring systems deliver health status reports to actors such as people under monitoring, practitioners and coaches for several purposes. In this paper, we propose E-Ambulance framework, which is a smart ambulance system model that provides health monitoring of patients for remote medical professionals. As well as provide an automatic responses of suggestions and warnings to paramedic staff inside an ambulance. Sensor networks record and deliver health status information to other elements of system. Due to the availability of information from sensors networks, an auto response can take place by alarms supervised by Decision Maker unit. Remote decisions can be made in a medical center after receiving inputs generated inside an ambulance. Building a distributed real time system can handle all aspects of time critical systems and hide heterogeneity between elements and different types of data. Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard is used to build the proposed model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in terms of latency and throughput, experiments are performed over \{DDS\} middleware. Additionally, to have efficient configuration different QoS policies configurations of \{DDS\} are tuned. "

The aims of the study were to develop an ergonomics checklist for the evaluation of \{MTPCs\} and to identify key ergonomics issues in the design as well as in the usage of MTPCs. In the first step of the study we undertook an overview of the checklists developed for computer workstations and mobile computer devices that are found in the human factors literature. This overview resulted in a categorization of checklists based on their organizations, rating scales, general purposes and level of detail. In the second step of the study an interview was conducted with 29 doctors; with a wide variety of specialization; in various hospitals to explore important issues as well as problem caused by computer usage. As the result of the analysis of answers given to interview questions and analysis of other checklists based on computers and medical devices 5 key concepts were chosen as the structural elements of the ergonomics checklist that is the primary output of this study, These key concepts are mobile usage, portability, office usage, cleaning and disinfection and hardware evaluation.

Different techniques and tools under the Industry 4.0 paradigm were already discussed in literature. These are aimed mostly at boosting company efficiency in terms of costs and environmental footprint. However, from a sustainability point of view, the social theme must be equally considered. While energy flows or costs can be already monitored in a production plant, this is not valid for data related to human effort. Monitoring systems aimed at supervising factory social sustainability were not already discussed in literature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to acquire social related data in a production plant. The method is supported by a smart architecture within the concept of IoT factory. Such architecture permits to monitor the parameters that could influence social sustainability in a production site. After a discussion on production plants facilities and features, the parameters that need to be considered to guarantee socially sustainable manufacturing processes are identified. A set of sensors controls these data taken from different sources, including operator vital signs. Operations as well as humans are monitored. Data acquired by sensors are collected by a central server. A decision maker can interpret the data and improve the production system from a social point of view, implementing corrective actions. Data can be exploited not only for social assessments but even for other analyses on the production system. Guaranteeing social sustainability could boost the factory productivity. A case study is included in the paper: smart sensors are implemented in a production line to understand the operations efficiency in terms of social sustainability. "

On the other hand, schemes using keep-alive messaging tend to increase the communication overhead, in particular if the time to detect a loss of contact needs to be short. We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application. Our solution was evaluated with usage data from a professional application built on the PalCom framework. The measurements show a 96 % decrease of the communication overhead while still maintaining the same system responsiveness. "

Thereby companies are facing enormous challenges relating to new products: increasing product and process complexities, less time-to-market and highest quality requirements. In addition to this, shorter product lifecycles cause frequent ramp-ups. Companies must develop skills to conquer these challenges especially in terms of developing professional ramp-up expertise. The transfer from prototype to scalable product causes many different unpredictable failures. Those failures require a strong failure management to guarantee the planned time-to-market. Key element in effective failure management is communication in this high interdisciplinary process. Today failure management in most companies is realized in task force mode. There is no system support from right failure notice, right failure classification and failure allocation to the right person to the point of effective support finding a solution as well as failure solution documentation. In addition to that there is no transparency about work in progress and allocated failures. The outcome of this is loss of time and inadequately documentation of failures which again causes loss of time.

The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and potential of transmitting image information using \{RF\} modules with lower frequencies (e.g., 433 MHz) to achieve a larger-scale deployment as in a city scenario. The Arduino platform is used because of its low cost and simplicity. Details of hardware properties are provided in this article, and we investigate optimum configurations for the system. After achieving an initial range test transmission distance of more than 2000 m line-of-sight, the prototype network is installed in a real life city plot for further examination of performance.

With Google's “Project Ara”, a modular and customizable smartphone approach is very likely to reach market maturity and its economic, social and ecologic impacts are still unclear. Using a qualitative case study approach, we shed light on its potential economic success. Furthermore, we use the two theoretical concepts of Eco Innovation (EI) and Systemic Innovation (SI) to assess Google Ara's potential to lead to changes in terms of ecologic and social concerns. In our analysis, we show that Project Ara has the potential to outperform its competitors of modular smartphones. We work out that Google's modular approach could lead to a longer useful life of smartphones – or at least for some components. Finally, we affirm Project Ara's general potential for being an SI. Even though Project Ara will very likely not change the complete smartphone market and the behavior of the involved actors, there is a potential for influencing sociocultural behavior in the long tail of the smartphone market.

This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘(’omic)’ approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established’omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially \{SNPs\} and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.

The recent proliferation of big data provides numerous opportunities for information-intensive services (IISs), in which information interactions exert the greatest effect on value creation. In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in \{IISs\} is essential for using \{IT\} to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new \{IISs\} and by analyzing data usage in 149 \{IIS\} cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs.

They are sometimes mandated by partners or governments, but always must rely on consultants. \{RFID\} is a technology that leads to automation of processes and limitation of simple human task. Authors proposed expert-analytic approach to challenge described issues. The approach was applied in several European manufacturing companies. It was confirmed that the scale of technology impact is exceeding pure area of \{RFID\} implementation. The approach is quick and constitutes a rationale of \{RFID\} implementation. The approach called \{ART\} (Assessment of \{RFID\} Technology) was positively verified. Results are satisfactory for rough comparison of pros and cons of \{RFID\} implemented in supply chain. Basing on achieved results, decision about further detailed analysis and design of \{RFID\} system, which is usually costly and time-consuming, could be made. The approach generates signposts for companies, if \{RFID\} should be considered. Assumptions of the approach are general and could be easily adjusted for other technologies. It is especially important when discussing technologies that are hardly comparable to other or reported case studies are very different, so company cannot rely on experiences of other organizations or fields of application. It is also a use case for evolved approach, when the scale of an impact of technology implementation is wide and not narrowed to the area of its physical implementation. "

Technologies aimed at fall detection, assessment, prediction and prevention are emerging, yet there has been no consistency in describing or reporting on interventions using technologies. With the growth of eHealth and data driven interventions, a common language and classification is required. Objective The \{FARSEEING\} Taxonomy of Technologies was developed as a tool for those in the field of biomedical informatics to classify and characterise components of studies and interventions. Methods The Taxonomy Development Group (TDG) comprised experts from across Europe. Through face-to-face meetings and contributions via email, five domains were developed, modified and agreed: Approach; Base; Components of outcome measures; Descriptors of technologies; and Evaluation. Each domain included sub-domains and categories with accompanying definitions. The classification system was tested against published papers and further amendments undertaken, including development of an online tool. Six papers were classified by the \{TDG\} with levels of consensus recorded. Results Testing the taxonomy with papers highlighted difficulties in definitions across international healthcare systems, together with differences of \{TDG\} members’ backgrounds. Definitions were clarified and amended accordingly, but some difficulties remained. The taxonomy and manual were large documents leading to a lengthy classification process. The development of the online application enabled a much simpler classification process, as categories and definitions appeared only when relevant. Overall consensus for the classified papers was 70.66%. Consensus scores increased as modifications were made to the taxonomy. Conclusion The \{FARSEEING\} Taxonomy of Technologies presents a common language, which should now be adopted in the field of biomedical informatics. In developing the taxonomy as an online tool, it has become possible to continue to develop and modify the classification system to incorporate new technologies and interventions. "

While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.

Standardisation plays a key role in shaping the rules that govern these developments and their effects on society. Due to the large variety of actors involved in these trends, the associated standardisation processes are likely to involve all three modes of standardisation identified in the literature: committee-based, market-based and government-based. This multi-mode standardisation challenges the theoretical views on standardisation which predominantly focus on one of the modes. In this paper, we review the existing literatures on individual modes and on multi-mode standardisation. By recombining existing evidence, we generate new insights into multi-mode standardisation processes. These first insights relate to the contributions that each mode can make to such processes’ outcomes and suggest that their impact depends on factors, such as their initiation’s timing and the institutional context in which the standardisation process occurs. Moreover, we consider the conditions under which actors can launch each mode. Based on our observations, we formulate an agenda for future research to obtain a better understanding of multi-mode standardisation. We offer recommendations for industry actors, NGOs, researchers and policy makers involved in shaping technological and societal change. "

To define a status quo, it is important to analyze the situation and to identify deficits, starting points and unexploited potentials. Still, a detailed understanding of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation is lacking especially in small and medium sized manufacturing companies. In addition, the fourth industrial revolution is associated by most companies only with logistics as well as production and manufacturing areas. The opportunities to integrate additional functional areas of the production process and the vertical value chain into the concept of the fourth industrial revolution are hardly considered. Starting from the point of view that the fourth industrial revolution is defined as a systematic increase in the flexibility of products and processes through automation, extensive networking and decentralized control mechanisms, as well as a data acquisition and integration through information and communication technologies, a study concept is developed. For this purpose, it is not enough to ask only for the present prevalence of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. It is necessary to analyze the processes within manufacturing companies. A survey concept is developed that initially breaks down the vertical value chain as well as the production process into specific sub-processes. These sub-processes are analyzed regarding their degree of automation and digitalization and networking among themselves. The results of this survey presents concisely the call for action, the state of implementation and realized solutions of the fourth industrial revolution in Germany. Furthermore, impulses and best practices for innovative products and business models can be given. "

In the manufacturing sector, the improvement of energy efficiency is a challenging task due to the complexity of manufacturing systems and the requirements for flexible operation targeting highly customised products. Towards this end, the estimation of the energy consumption of a machining task, and therefore the machining cost, is necessary. This paper presents a machine tool monitoring methodology that integrates sensory systems, a scheduling module, and human operators to perform real-time monitoring on the shop-floor. A monitoring system is designed to capture real-time measurements from sensors attached on machine tools and perform the necessary pre-processing to transmit these measurements to a Cloud server via wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, the input from human operators is utilized to collect the machining parameters. The collected information is fused through an information fusion mechanism to extract meaningful results. The results are stored in a database for the reuse in future tasks by estimating the energy consumption of new cases, through a case-based reasoning approach, prior the job dispatching. Therefore, the machining parameters of the new case can be modified targeting energy consumption reduction. The proposed system is delivered as a Cloud software-as-a-service to realise the philosophy of Cloud manufacturing. "

The adoption of Product-Service Systems (PSS) strategies appears as a promising solution. However, practical application of \{PSS\} sustainable approaches is still limited. This may be associated to the fact that a \{PSS\} does not guarantee environmental improvements if it is not specifically designed with this purpose. \{PSS\} design process models can play a relevant role in supporting companies in designing sustainable \{PSS\} when they incorporate activities, methods and tools to approach the sustainability dimensions. Not only the process models, but also the intentions of practitioners and their awareness towards sustainability during the design of a \{PSS\} influence the dissemination of sustainable PSS. The objective of this work is to investigate whether the existent \{PSS\} design process models support the design of sustainable \{PSS\} and whether practitioners employ sustainability-related activities when designing PSS. Nine process models were analyzed and the perspective of practitioners about considering sustainability issues when designing \{PSS\} were captured. The collected data shows that only few of the analyzed process models actually propose activities, methods or tools to support a sustainable \{PSS\} design. This suggests an existing gap between literature and the practitioners’ expectations of \{PSS\} design process models. Moreover, those activities, methods and tools are mainly focused on eco-efficiency and the social dimension is generally not covered. "

This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between ‘emerging trends’ (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and ‘new frontiers’, which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions.

However, in healthcare, such practices, beyond elicitation, are immature. The introduction of changes to existing healthcare processes or e-systems often fails because users’ needs and operational/organizational goals may not get satisfied. In addition, healthcare is moving toward a value-based paradigm that requires a comprehensive evaluation and re-engineering of current processes, which puts more pressure on healthcare professionals to apply advanced \{RE\} techniques, such as goal and process modeling, in order to obtain much desired results effectively. In this paper, we discuss the integration of new technology-depending processes, e.g., that come with off-the-shelf solutions, with existing healthcare processes. We propose the use of an Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) framework to investigate the impact of each potential integration on the organizational goals and user satisfaction. Performance indicators are used to reason about measurable quantities beyond goal satisfaction. The paper implements the AbPI approach with the User Requirement Notation standard and illustrates its feasibility with a real example related to wait time indication in an emergency room.

Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics. "

We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the \{NHS\} is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments. The model strategy comprises rewarding people with shopping vouchers (Tesco club card points or nectar points) each time they confirm or cancel a medical appointment online or by \{SMS\} text message. With this model, the \{NHS\} would improve the management of their resources, may improve the quality of service and may have higher user satisfaction. Nevertheless, future challenges may include the adaptation of current \{NHS\} business processes and the management of the collaboration with private organizations. "

There are several reasons why the health-care industry is the focus of this investigation. For instance, in the \{UK\} various studies point to the lack of failure of basic quality control procedures and misalignment between customer needs and provider services and duplication of logistics practices. The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing. "

We will show that it is a very cost-effective way to build refuges, and viable solutions exist for various budgets and timeframes. Nuclear submarines are surface independent, and could provide energy, oxygen, fresh water and perhaps even food for their inhabitants for years. They are able to withstand close nuclear explosions and radiation. They are able to maintain isolation from biological attacks and most known weapons. They already exist and need only small adaptation to be used as refuges. But building refuges is only “Plan B” of existential risk preparation; it is better to eliminate such risks than try to survive them. "

The present paper introduces a service robot system with an informationally structured environment referred to the ROS–TMS. This system enables the integration of various data from distributed sensors, as well as storage of these data in an on-line database and the planning of the service motion of a robot using real-time information about the surroundings.

Geometry and topology are very natural tools for analysing massive amounts of data since geometry can be regarded as the study of distance functions. Mathematical formalism, which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques, deals with point cloud data sets, i.e. finite sets of points. It then adapts tools from the various branches of geometry and topology for the study of point cloud data sets. The point clouds are finite samples taken from a geometric object, perhaps with noise. Topology provides a formal language for qualitative mathematics, whereas geometry is mainly quantitative. Thus, in topology, we study the relationships of proximity or nearness, without using distances. A map between topological spaces is called continuous if it preserves the nearness structures. Geometrical and topological methods are tools allowing us to analyse highly complex data. These methods create a summary or compressed representation of all of the data features to help to rapidly uncover particular patterns and relationships in data. The idea of constructing summaries of entire domains of attributes involves understanding the relationship between topological and geometric objects constructed from data using various features. A common thread in various approaches for noise removal, model reduction, feasibility reconstruction, and blind source separation, is to replace the original data with a lower dimensional approximate representation obtained via a matrix or multi-directional array factorization or decomposition. Besides those transformations, a significant challenge of feature summarization or subset selection methods for Big Data will be considered by focusing on scalable feature selection. Lower dimensional approximate representation is used for Big Data visualization. The cross-field between topology and Big Data will bring huge opportunities, as well as challenges, to Big Data communities. This survey aims at bringing together state-of-the-art research results on geometrical and topological methods for Big Data. "

abstract = "Abstract Since the mid-2000s, the “Smart City” has emerged as a popular discourse describing technological solutions to challenges of urban governance. The Smart City has been praised but also criticized as a discourse for its narrow epistemology. Limitations have led to reductionist benchmarking that lends itself to comparison, yet limits practitioners’ ability to translate findings into ontologically diverse action. In the related fields of information systems and management studies, a pragmatist research paradigm has been used to address this challenge. This article explores that pragmatist paradigm, describing how it can expand the current limits of the current Smart City discourse to include local politics, technologies, and the relational genealogies that characterize sociotechnical systems. The pragmatist methodology I explore here uses excerpts from practitioner oral histories—organized visually using actor-network theory—to define and explain the emergence of two Smart City initiatives. This approach is capable of a more situated and contingent practitioner explanation of the complexity of urban projects. Ultimately, the article concludes with reflections on the use of pragmatism for Smart City cases to provide a counter perspective to the dominant discourse. "

In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of \{IURVs\} with different forms. Five case studies are presented of \{IURVs\} in the countries with the largest number of \{IURVs\} involving \{US\} universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of \{IURVs\} depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the \{IURV\} in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved. "

Thanks to new achievements in ICT, all product stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, consumers, service providers) have got the possibility to more intensively interact with each other and thereupon profit from that. This novel approach has led the development features of products to a new era of cyber-physical systems, resulting in higher individualized and user-friendly product experiences, reflecting intelligent and connected products throughout their life-cycles. Accordingly, such products configure product-service systems with accompanying several merits, e.g., flexibility, adaptability, reactivity, expertise, and x-gradability. Prospective products due to their adaptable design, associated services and Avatars are able to cover a range of customizations upon the current and prospective needs of customers. Besides, manufacturers can profit from this approach for adopting new production strategies. This perspective is recommended and conceptually explored in this paper. "

In order to facilitate and to structure the understanding of solar control systems two multidimensional spaces are introduced: the design space and the evaluation space. The design space contains the design parameters which are to be selected by the designer when solar control devices are to be chosen for specific buildings or when new systems are to be developed, such us the color of the slat of a venetian blind or the fraction of holes (direct transmittance) of a fabric for a roller blind. The evaluation space contains the performance parameters or evaluation criteria, which indicate the design‘s ability to satisfy the functional and aesthetic requirements, such us passive solar gain control or visual comfort. All the design parameters and evaluation criteria are explained in detail in the paper. A chapter with examples of advanced solar control systems completes the overview of the state of the art of solar control systems. "

Globally, a number of sensors being produced for animal health management are at various stages of commercialization. Some technologies for producing an accurate health status and disease diagnosis are applicable only for humans, with few modifications or testing in animal models. Now, these innovative technologies are being considered for their future use in livestock development and welfare. Precision livestock farming techniques, which include a wide span of technologies, are being applied, along with advanced technologies like microfluidics, sound analyzers, image-detection techniques, sweat and salivary sensing, serodiagnosis, and others. However, there is a need to integrate all the available sensors and create an efficient online monitoring system so that animal health status can be monitored in real time, without delay. This review paper discusses the scope of different wearable technologies for animals, nano biosensors and advanced molecular biology diagnostic techniques for the detection of various infectious diseases of cattle, along with the efforts to enlist and compare these technologies with respect to their drawbacks and advantages in the domain of animal health management. The paper considers all recent developments in the field of biosensors and their applications for animal health to provide insight regarding the appropriate approach to be used in the future of enhanced animal welfare.

We propose an adaptive sampling scheme to collect accurate real-time traffic information from large-scale implementations of on-board GPS-based devices over a road network. The goal of the system is to minimize the transmission costs over all vehicles while satisfying requirements in the accuracy and timeliness of the traffic information obtained. The system is designed to make use of cellular communication as well as leveraging additional technologies such as roadside units equipped with WiFi and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). As opposed to fixed sampling schemes, which transmit at regular intervals, the sampling policy we propose is adaptive to the road network and the importance of the links that the vehicle traverses. Since cellular communications are costly, in the basic centralized scheme, the vehicle is not aware of the road conditions on the network. We extend the scheme to handle non-cellular communications via roadside units and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Under a general traffic model, we prove that our scheme always outperforms the baseline scheme in terms of transmission cost while satisfying accuracy and real-time requirements. Our analytical results are further supported via simulations based on actual road networks for both the centralized and \{V2V\} settings. "

A critical reason for such bad recommendations lies in the intrinsic assumption that recommended users and items are independent and identically distributed (IID) in existing theories and systems. Another phenomenon is that, while tremendous efforts have been made to model specific aspects of users or items, the overall user and item characteristics and their non-IIDness have been overlooked. In this paper, the non-IID nature and characteristics of recommendation are discussed, followed by the non-IID theoretical framework in order to build a deep and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic nature of recommendation problems, from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. This non-IID recommendation research triggers the paradigm shift from \{IID\} to non-IID recommendation research and can hopefully deliver informed, relevant, personalized, and actionable recommendations. It creates exciting new directions and fundamental solutions to address various complexities including cold-start, sparse data-based, cross-domain, group-based, and shilling attack-related issues. "

abstract = "Abstract In many areas, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has made the decisive steps from prototyping to true manufacturing technology. \{AM\} processes excel based on aspects like outstanding geometrical flexibility and lack of tooling, which allows significant lead time reductions both in initial product design and in case of design adaptations. However, in production today, most of these advantages are realized based on homogeneous materials. Attempts at advancing the state of the art address the topic of material combinations and functionally graded materials. The challenges faced by such approaches differ in their level of severity, and are influenced in this respect by the actual \{AM\} process chosen. Beyond composites with spatially varying properties, the next level of complexity is the integration of geometrically defined 3D structures within the volume of a part, and specifically functional structures at that. Endeavours of the latter kind are currently receiving increased attention under headlines like “Structural Electronics” or “3D Electronics Printing”. Here, the surface or volume integrated structure typically is a sensor or electronic system. Beyond this system, the \{AM\} process then either provides a complex 3D substrate and thus addresses the packaging issue and/or replaces a conventional PCB, or it generates an engineering component directly and closely integrates it with electronic and sensor systems. So far, the backbone of most solutions realized have been hybrid production systems that integrate different manufacturing processes in a single piece of equipment. The present work provides a brief introduction to the various \{AM\} techniques and discusses a disambiguation based on their general capability of producing functional structures on a volume integration level. A classification of such structures is suggested that accounts for their level of complexity in relation to the typical, layer-wise manufacturing scheme adopted in AM. Examples stemming from a global research landscape are discussed in the context of this classification. In this, two special foci are selected reflecting related activities at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials (Fraunhofer IFAM): One of these is a combination of manufacturing processes, with functional printing and other direct write techniques linked to \{AM\} processes in a dedicated manufacturing cell. The other addresses integration of pre-fabricated electronic components like \{RFID\} systems into metal components produced by means of selective laser melting (SLM).The study closes with an overview of future research trends towards producing components with integrated electronics. In doing so, special emphasis is given to \{AM\} techniques that allow for in-process switching of materials and thus have the potential of realizing complex systems not by combination of processes, but within the boundaries of a single process. Also addressed are potential application scenarios that profit specifically from the combination of \{AM\} and sensor integration. "
