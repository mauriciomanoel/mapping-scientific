abstract = "Abstract Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.

Here, Raspberry Pi is used to build a low-cost biometric system. Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a credit-sized mini-computer with great capabilities similar to a PC. In this study it is used as a remote enrollment node. The application of Raspberry Pi and cloud computing has given a new direction of research into the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT).

To maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet channel from \{RPi\} client to the cloud, cryptographic algorithms are applied like \{RSA\} and enhanced AES-256.

In the fast forwarding IoT paradigm, hundreds of billions of things are estimated to be deployed which would give rise to an enormous amount of data. Cloud computing has been the prevailing choice for controlling the connected things and the data, and providing intelligence based on the data. But response time and network load are on the higher side for cloud based solutions. Recently, edge computing is gaining growing attention to overcome this by employing rule-based intelligence. However, requirements of rules do not scale well with the proliferation of things. At the same time, rules fail in uncertain events and only offer pre-assumed intelligence. To counter this, this paper proposes a novel idea of leveraging the belief-network with the edge computing to utilize as an IoT edge-controller the aim of which is to offer low-level intelligence for IoT applications. This low-level intelligence along with cloud-based intelligence form the distributed intelligence in the IoT realm. Furthermore, a learning approach similar to reinforcement learning has been proposed. The approach, i.e. enabling a Future IoT Controller (FITC) has been verified with a simulated SmartHome scenario which proves the feasibility of the low-level intelligence in terms of reducing rules domination, faster response time and prediction through learning experiences at the edge.

We designed an IoT-based system architecture from a sensor device to a back-end system for presenting real-time glucose, body temperature and contextual data (i.e. environmental temperature) in graphical and human-readable forms to end-users such as patients and doctors. In addition, nRF communication protocol is customized for suiting to the glucose monitoring system and achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate energy consumption of the sensor device and design energy harvesting units for the device. Finally, the work provides many advanced services at a gateway level such as a push notification service for notifying patient and doctors in case of abnormal situations (i.e. too low or too high glucose level). The results show that our system is able to achieve continuous glucose monitoring remotely in real-time. In addition, the results reveal that a high level of energy efficiency can be achieved by applying the customized nRF component, the power management unit and the energy harvesting unit altogether in the sensor device.

In this paper, we argue that as the human agency and relationship intrinsically associated with care get transferred to the material agency of smart technology, value and trust should be a vital consideration for designing such services. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from the literature on services innovation, design science and trust in relation to healthcare technologies, we present a conceptual framework that articulates various levels of trust among the concerned stakeholders in the service ecosystem and suggests value-sensitive design considerations, anchored on the principles of trust, for future IoT-enabled assistive care services.

The aim is to design cross-domain applications that compose and select most relevant services, which best match user requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model for smart objects description and users request resolution using ontological techniques combined with description logics. Such a model facilitates intelligent functions, including reasoning over service data and semantic interoperability enabling among devices. A case study for smart environment monitoring has been proposed to illustrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach. "

Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art \{PPDA\} techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of \{PPDA\} techniques. "

The concept of the Internet of Things and Services envisions physical devices and appliances to be used as easily as a web service and seamlessly integrated into networked applications with required functionality. Technologically this concept is clear, and several smart applications are currently under development (see e.g. iCore, Hydra, Confidence or IoT@Work projects). However, the business perspective of information as an asset in its own right remains an open issue. To handle this issue we apply an originally value-based requirement technique, e3-value, to model value creation and value exchange within an e-business network of multiple business actors. Using this approach the business activity can be reduced to its core elements, which in the simplest case comprise the value proposition, distribution channels and the customers of the company, explaining how a multi-actor network creates, distributes and consumes value by production of a good or providing a service.

It also enables students to build confidence in their decision making, and efficiently enhances teamwork in the learing environment. We propose an IoT-based Flip Learning Platform, called IoTFLiP, where an IoT infrastructure is exploited to support flipped case-based learning in a cloud environment with state of the art security and privacy measures for personalized medical data. It also provides support for application delivery in private, public, and hybrid approaches. The proposed platform is an extension of our Interactive Case-Based Flipped Learning Tool (ICBFLT), which has been developed based on current \{CBL\} practices. \{ICBFLT\} formulates summaries of \{CBL\} cases through synergy between students' and medical expert knowledge. The low cost and reduced size of sensor device, support of IoTs, and recent flipped learning advancements can enhance medical students' academic and practical experiences. In order to demonstrate a working scenario for the proposed IoTFLiP platform, real-time data from IoTs gadgets is collected to generate a real-world case for a medical student using ICBFLT. "

The aim of this study is to expand understanding of how IoT can create value in the retail grocery choice situation. To investigate the impact of IoT-related information on consumer choice in a shopping situation, we arranged a conjoint experiment in which participants (n = 61) purchased fresh salmon in a grocery store. The results (Pearson´s r = 0.939, p = 0.000) show that relative to static information about price, expiry date, quality, and offers given, the real-time information was the most salient stimulus when choosing fresh salmon. Moreover, quality ratings by other customers were the most salient stimuli among real-time information, followed by an offer based on a product in the shopping cart, real-time expiry date, and real-time price. These findings contribute both to researchers and managers within grocery retailing who want to understand how IoT can be used in a way that creates value for the customers. "

Nowdays a large number of devices are connected to the web, ranging from mobile devices to appliances. In this paper we focus on the education field, where Internet of Things can be used to create more significant learning spaces. In this sense, we propose a system that allows students to interact with physical surrounding objects which are virtualy associated with a subject of learning. We conduct an experimental validation of our approach, yielding evidence that our model improves the student's learning outcomes. "

Firstly, the Holographic Workshop Map (HWM) is defined and designed to construct the framework of the proposed RTLS. Then, the real-time location platform, which is composed of RFID-based regional positioning and UWB-based precise positioning methods, is built to get the real-time location information of all kinds of manufacturing factors in the large discrete manufacturing workshop. Finally, a simulative 8-workstations workshop is constructed and a prototype system is developed to verify the proposed method.

Most research, to a large extent, focus on requesting data, which is based on user inference and decision making, by utilising provenance information. However, little or nothing has been done regarding requests and responses and, most importantly, from the machine perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes a light-weight prototype system for tracing the source of requests/responses using provenance information over CoAP in the Internet of Things. We also provide performance evaluation of the prototypic system using metrics such as response time (ms) and throughput (KB/s). Finally, findings from our experiment are presented and discussed. "

Radio Frequency IDentification, putting an identification label into every object, enables a smart system to get information, either real-time or virtual-linked information, without any physical contact. Information retrieved from such an object, turns it into a potential smart object, certainly able to auto identify itself and, if security problems are suitably treated, most probably able to connect to the global Internet. This way, one can get an ubiquitous framework to access, monitor and control any of those smart objects over an Internet of connected things. \{RFID\} tags in medical context enable a rapid and precise identification of each smart entity, enabling a ubiquitous and quick access to Personal Health Records over an Internet of Things. The use of smart phones with Internet access, along with strong security concerns - such as authenticity, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, entity authentication and non-repudiation - turn this whole context into a decentralized and mobile healthcare system. Using the simple IoT architecture presented, combining smart objects, the security solution and mobile communications, one may remotely take care of patients’ well being, establishing an ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living for Mobile Health applications.

This prevalence of IoT promises to impact every aspect of human life in the foreseeable future where computing paradigm would witness huge influx of IoT data.

Contextualizing the collected IoT data enables to reap value from the data and to harvest the knowledge. Reasoning the contextualized data, that is, context information is imperative to the vision of harvesting knowledge. Edge computing is also expected to play a vital role in IoT to reduce dependency on cloud based solution, to achieve faster response, and to provide intelligence closer to the IoT things. The combination of context-awareness and edge solution would be inseparable in the future IoT. Furthermore, IoT vision comprises of different IoT applications controlled by a capable controller at the edge, an edge controller necessitates to counter the challenge of providing knowledge for each of the IoT applications. Therefore, such a controller requires to offer different context-aware reasoning to alleviate the intelligence-of-things. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-modal context-aware reasoner the aim of which is to provide knowledge at the edge for each IoT application. The context-aware reasoning has been verified with rules-based and Bayesian reasoning for three IoT applications and initial results suggest that it is promising to realize such multimodal reasoning at the edge with low latency.

The functionality can be encapsulated as services and the task executed by composing the services. Two noteworthy functionalities of IoT services are monitoring and actuation. Monitoring implies continuous executions, and actuation is by triggering. Continuous executions typically involve stream processing. Stream input data are accumulated into batches and each batch is subjected to a sequence of computations, structured as a dataflow graph. The composition may be processing several batches simultaneously. Additionally, some non-stream \{OLTP\} transactions may also be executing concurrently. Thus, several composite transactions may be executing concurrently. This is in contrast to a typical Web services composition, where just one composite transaction is executed on each invocation. Therefore, defining transactional properties for executions of IoT service compositions is much more complex than for those of conventional Web service compositions. In this paper, we propose a transaction model and a correctness criterion for executions of IoT service compositions. Our proposal defines relaxed atomicity and isolation properties for transactions in a flexible manner and can be adapted for a variety of IoT applications. "

By 2020, it is estimated that the total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50 billion. As the numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume of data published will increase. Internet-connected devices technology, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet by providing connectivity and interaction between the physical and cyber worlds. In addition to increased volume, the IoT generates Big Data characterized by velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this Big Data is the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses the different machine learning methods that deal with the challenges in IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution of this study is presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for IoT data analytics will also be discussed.

The high connectivity of intelligent objects and their severe constraints lead to many security challenges, which are not included in the classical formulation of security problems and solutions. The Security Shield for Internet of Things has been identified by \{DARPA\} (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) as one of the four projects with a potential impact broader than the Internet itself. To help interested researchers contribute to this research area, an overview of the IoT security roadmap overview is presented in this paper based on a novel cognitive and systemic approach. The role of each component of the approach is explained and interactions with the other main components, and their impact on the overall. A case study is presented to highlight the components and interactions of the systemic and cognitive approach. Then, security questions about privacy, trust, identification, and access control are discussed. According to the novel taxonomy of the IoT framework, different research challenges are highlighted, important solutions and research activities are revealed, and interesting research directions are proposed. In addition, current standardization activities are surveyed and discussed to the ensure the security of IoT components and applications. "

These low cost \{WSN\} devices provide automation in medical and environmental monitoring. Evaluating the performance of these sensors using \{RPL\} enhances their use in real world applications. The realization of these \{RPL\} performances from different nodes focuses our study to utilize \{WSNs\} in our day-to-day applications.

This heterogeneity is reflected on raw data gathered by such type of systems. Consequently, the task of high-level IoT applications to interpret such data and detect events in the real world is more complex. Moreover, data heterogeneity leads to the lack of interoperability between IoT applications. Semantic Web (SW) technologies have been widely adopted to model and integrate data from different sources on the web; extending them to the IoT domain can be used to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Semantically annotating IoT data is a fundamental step toward developing smarter and interoperable IoT applications. However, this type of process requires a large amount of computing resources, especially in scenarios where a large number of sensors is expected to be involved such as smart city. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight semantic annotation approach that can be implemented on resource-constrained IoT gateways connected to a limited number of sensors. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have carried out a set of experimentations using a middleware prototype implementation. Several benchmarks are considered such as: Data size, response time, and resource utilization. "

Several edge computing technologies originating from different backgrounds have been emerging to decrease latency, improve SE, and support the massive machine type of communication. This paper comprehensively presents a tutorial of three typical edge computing technologies, including the mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing. In particular, the standardization efforts, principles, architectures, and applications for these three technologies are summarized and compared. From the viewpoint of radio access network, the difference between mobile edge computing and fog computing are highlighted, and the characteristics of fog computing based radio access network are discussed.

Machine learning approaches usually require a large amount of computational power and storage resources and \{ML\} is commonly performed off-line, not suitable for resource constrained sensor network implementations. Instead, a novel distributed-regional on-line learning is applied, with on-line distributed sensor processing and learning performed by the agent system. The \{APP\} provides \{ML\} as a service, and the agent itself only collects training and analysis data passed to the APP, finally returning a learned model that is saved by the agent in a compact format (and is available on any other location). A case study shows that the learning algorithm is suitable (stable) for noisy and time varying sensor data. Spatial global learning is reduced and mapped on local region learning with global voting.

The reconfiguration process brings a critical issue within the \{RMS\} that is called as reconfiguration planning (RP) problems in this paper. However, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) that has been a global issue, many companies or manufacturers are trying to integrate it into their smart systems. \{RMS\} as well needs to apply IoT in order to establish the internetworking between machines and the logic, so that \{RP\} problems can be solved, automated, and controlled.

India as a developing country has a great prospect in developing technologies to make the cities smart. As urbanization occurs the demand for resources and efficient servicing will increase. To achieve this in a smart and efficient way, connected device (IoT) could be used. The possible design of an IoT system based on surveys performed on similar smart solutions implemented has been discussed in this paper. Urbanization and population growth has led to higher demand for resources like water which are of scarce. There is a keen interest from the organizations and government to make proper usage of water. The same can be achieved by proper monitoring and management of water distribution systems. The paper discusses the use of Machine learning techniques to smart city management aspects like smart water management which include water demand forecasting, water quality monitoring and anomaly detection.

The IoT has already enabled these bodies to develop a new network of intercommunicating objects of consumers’ everyday life. Companies staffing many (potentially thousands) of employees may require hundreds of health and safety systems in continuous use. Building Service Managers, however, do not know which devices needs maintenance or replenishment and require significant amount of time to continuously check that their health and safety systems are maintained according to legislation requirements. The consequences of companies not meeting their health and safety obligations are serious and expensive if any of their employees are seriously injured as a consequence of the health and safety products not being in their original, immaculate order for use. Furthermore, insurance companies will refuse to pay compensation for injury to employees if it has been shown that the health and safety products are not in their original, immaculate order for use. Therefore, design and use an IoT based monitoring system to record the state of health and safety products within companies is an urgent response to market. This paper presents consequences and associated procedures for efficient application of the IoT. "

Disruption to the more traditional industrial practices and processes is inevitable. High Performance Cutting is no exception. Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) opens up new and extremely powerful capabilities to help us gain a significantly deeper understanding of the fundamentals of cutting processes and offers entirely new connectivity possibilities at all interfaces, some old and some new, “between the Chip Root and the Cloud”. This supports us in our attempts since the foundation of \{CIRP\} in 1951 to remove technological roadblocks and can lead on a new journey towards new and unprecedented scientific/technological developments as well as new business models for companies involved in the various elements of the supply chain for cutting processes (DIN 8580). “Performance” will take on a new and unanticipated meaning over what was originally meant when we established this CIRP-HPC Conference back in the early 2000's.

Despite the large number of research related to increasing the life expectancy of a network, node positioning, network clustering as well as the optimization of the data-processing model, issues related to the data flow management and classification of the information become more and more topical; they allow to reduce the amount of transmitted information within the network. The network load of the unstructured information flow is the most important aspect that impacts the service quality of the network as well as the life expectancy of a node; as a result, the methods of network performance optimization and increase in life expectancy in the networks with a high information transmission rate become ineffective. Nowadays the amount of transmitted information in the Internet of Things networks is increased and becomes chaotic which results in the reduction of the overall network efficiency and life expectancy. The article discusses the management method of the network data flow that can respond to a data flow programming task whilst taking into account the balancing of the node energy in the network. "

Modern sociology and social philosophy refer to things as to the something that had not previously shown as a relatively independent object without being the representator of the other types of reality and relationships in the world: social, economic (in terms production, distribution and consumption), political, etc. In our opinion, now a thing acquires a special status in philosophical studies, becoming a kind of condensation point of being. Such attention to the things due to several factors, including: the modern understanding of space and time, the expansion of the current “real” crisis idealistic philosophical ideas, the reorientation of phenomenology. In a situation of rapid development of information technologies there is such a phenomenon as the “Internet of things”, which captures not only the conjugation of human individuals in the information network, but also systems and hardware devices that can often go without human intervention. Such a phenomenon requires a philosophical rethinking, and represents the focus on perceptual and bodily aspects of life in the modern world. "

Decision-support tools incorporating models of disparate farming activities, either on their own or in combination with other models, offer one popular approach; exemplars include GPFARM, APSIM, \{GRAZPLAN\} amongst many others. Such models tend to be generic in nature and their adoption by individual farmers is minimal. Smart technologies offer an opportunity to remedy this situation; farm-specific models that can reflect near real-time events become tractable using such technologies. Research on the development, and application of farm-specific models is at a very early stage. This paper thus presents an overview of models within the farming enterprise; it then reviews the state-of the art in smart technologies that promise to enable a new generation of enterprise-specific models that will underpin future smart farming enterprises.

The RememberMe exhibition connected personal audio recordings to items that had been donated to Oxfam in Manchester, UK. Memories associated with donated objects were recorded by previous owners and attached to the items prior to reselling, either by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags or Quick Read (QR) code labels. The RememberUS exhibition emphasised the importance of the information rather than the object, utilising dummy objects as a vessel for holding memories. Customers were observed spending more time interacting with tagged items and searching for further tagged items in the store, allowing a greater understanding of the journey the objects had taken. From the retailer viewpoint: customers were more likely to buy tagged objects, increasing sales revenue.

We present first motivating use cases and review existing approaches and design considerations for the proposed system. Then we show our platform which materializes the principles of an open and participatory edge environment, to lower the entry barriers for service deployment at the network edge. By using containers, our platform can flexibly enable third-party services, and may serve as an infrastructure to support several application domains of ambient intelligence. "

In this paper, we elicit the need for different self-learning techniques to tackle the openness of the IoT environments and propose enabling algorithms to achieve them. First, we present possible application scenarios which can benefit from both supervised and unsupervised self-learning. Later, we propose correlation mining algorithms based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and frequent set mining that exploits correlated contexts to enable unsupervised self-learning. These algorithms help to identify alternate sources for a context and semantically describe the previously unseen contexts in terms of already known contexts. We have realized the proposed algorithms on top of a Bayesian framework (HARD-BN) which supports autonomous learning. Our experiments demonstrate the applicability of the proposed correlation mining algorithms and their feasibility to enable self-learning in open and ever-evolving IoT environments. "

abstract = "Abstract The interest of the building energy sector is leaning towards the measurement of building actual performance, as regards both indoor environment quality and energy consumption. Sensors and central elaboration units aimed at monitoring indoor environment and \{HVAC\} system parameters can also provide the basic infrastructure for further applications such as predictive and neuro-fuzzy controls. However, the cost of such systems is high, so they are mainly used in large buildings. This paper describes the main features and expected applications for a low-budget monitoring platform currently under development and tuning. In particular, the monitoring system was developed based on electronic prototyping platform Arduino and on sensors and devices usually available in the retail market of electronics. The monitoring platform has been designed with the following characteristics in mind: replicability, full remote control, portability, versatility, reliability and affordability. "

This poses a number of security and privacy challenges exacerbated by a heterogeneous and dynamic environment, but still requires standards for handling personally identifiable and medical information of patients and in some cases caregivers to be maintained. Whilst risk and threat assessments generally assume a stable and well-defined environment, this cannot be done in \{MIoT\} environments where devices may be added, removed, or changed in their configuration including connectivity to server back ends. Conducting a complete threat assessment for each such configuration changes is infeasible. In this paper, we seek to define a mechanism for prioritising \{MIoT\} threats and aspects of the analysis that are likely to be affected by composition and related alterations.

As air pollution being a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings that need to be controlled. Hence, we deployed \{WSN\} nodes for constant monitoring of the air pollution around the city and the moving public transport buses and cars. This methodology gave us the monitoring data from the stationary nodes deployed in the city to the mobile nodes on Public Transport buses and cars. The data of the air pollution particles such as gases, smoke and other pollutants is collected via sensors on the Public transport buses and the data is being analyzed when the buses and cars reach back to the source destination after passing through the stationary nodes around the city. Our proposed architecture having innovative mesh network will be more efficient way of gathering data from the nodes of WSN. It will have lots of benefits with respect to the future concept of Smart Cities that will have the new technologies related to Internet of Things. "

This information can be used in applications that control \{HVAC\} (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and lighting systems, or in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications which monitor the people's wellbeing. In our approach we use data from two simple sensors, passive infrared sensor (PIR) which monitors presence and hall effect sensor which monitors whether the door is opened or closed. This installation is non-intrusive and quite simple because the sensor node to which sensors are connected is battery powered, and no additional work to ensure power supply needs to be performed. Two approaches for activity detection are proposed, first based on a sliding window, and the other based on artificial neural network (ANN). The algorithms are tested on a dataset collected in our laboratory environment. "

Because the traditional healthcare mode is passive, by which patients call the healthcare service by themselves. Consequently, they usually fail to call the service if they are unconscious when the heart disease attacks. The Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have overwhelming superiority in solving the problem of heart diseases patients care as they can change the service mode into a pervasive way, and trigger the healthcare service based on patients’ physical status rather than their feelings. In order to realize the pervasive healthcare service, a remote monitoring system is essential. In this paper, we proposed a pervasive monitoring system that can send patients’ physical signs to remote medical applications in real time. The system is mainly composed of two parts: the data acquisition part and the data transmission part. The monitoring scheme (monitoring parameters and frequency for each parameter) is the key point of the data acquisition part, and we designed it based on interviews to medical experts. Multiple physical signs (blood pressure, ECG, SpO2, heart rate, pulse rate, blood fat and blood glucose) as well as an environmental indicator (patients’ location) are designed to be sampled at different rates continuously. Four data transmission modes are presented taking patients’ risk, medical analysis needs, demands for communication and computing resources into consideration. Finally, a sample prototype is implemented to present an overview of the system. "

We focus on opportunities and challenges stemming from consumption data that comes from ICO, and on how this data can be mapped onto strategic choices of product variety. We develop a simple analytical framework that illustrates the underlying mechanisms of a product supplier/producer׳s choice between (i) producing multiple product varieties as a way of meeting consumer demand (a “tailoring strategy”), and (ii) offering a flexible and standardised platform which enables consumers׳ needs to be met by incorporating personal \{ICO\} data into various customisable applications (a “platform strategy”). Under a platform strategy, the \{ICO\} data is independently produced by other providers and can be called on in both use and context of use. We derive conditions under which each of the strategies may be profitable for the provider through maximising consumers’ value. Our findings are that the higher the demand for contextual variety, the more profitable the platform strategy becomes, relative to the tailoring strategy. Our study concludes by considering the implications for \{SCM\} research and practice with an extension to postponement taxonomies, including those where the customer, and not the supplier, is the completer of the product, and we show that this yields higher profits than the tailoring strategy.

Over the past two decades, research challenges in pervasive computing have evolved following the rapid progress of information and communication technology. Researchers are working to create an “Internet of Things” that globally interconnects smart devices and sensor networks. Technologies such as wireless communication, ubiquitous sensors, and passive or semi-passive RFID, are essential to monitor the transport chain. “Pervasive adaptation” is a new research challenge that has been recently introduced to describe system's ability to autonomously recognize the situation and adapt to situational changes. For example, it is expected that intelligent parcels that can observe and evaluate current environmental conditions including traffic information, velocity, new orders, temperature, or storage conditions, and decide adaptations such as changing transport route or destination and swapping vehicle. In order modern ubiquitous computing devices to become fully functional they need to overcome compatibility and security problems; these issues as well as potential solutions are explored in this paper. On the other hand, as new technology such as Ultra High Frequency \{RFID\} becomes more mature, it is launching into ubiquitous status in commerce and society. "

These initiatives lead to an urgent need to advance current manufacturing systems into a high level of intelligence and autonomy. As the main component of any manufacturing system, machine tools have evolved from manually operated machines into the current computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools. It is predicted that current \{CNC\} machine tools are not intelligent and autonomous enough to support the smart manufacturing systems envisioned by the aforementioned initiatives. Inspired by recent advances in \{ICT\} such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a new generation of machine tools, i.e. Machine Tool 4.0, as a future development trend of machine tools. Machine Tool 4.0, otherwise known as Cyber-Physical Machine Tool (CPMT), is the integration of machine tool, machining processes, computation and networking, where embedded computers and networks can monitor and control the machining processes, with feedback loops in which machining processes can affect computations and vice versa. The main components and functions of a \{CPMT\} are presented. The key research issues related to the development of \{CPMT\} are identified and discussed. A three-layer CPMT-centered Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) is proposed to illustrate both the vertical integration of various smart systems at different hierarchical levels and the horizontal integration of field-level manufacturing facilities and resources.

To mitigate the effect, gardening (to plant trees and shrubs) becomes more and more important than just a hobby. Besides, maintenance of a garden is a tedious process and also time-consuming. Often the gardener lacks in knowledge about the requirements of plant (nutrient and the amount of water to be sprayed) to enhance its growth. In this regard, it is necessary to build an autonomous gardening robotic vehicle which automatically identifies and classifies the plant species using feature extraction algorithms (Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Oriented \{FAST\} and Rotated \{BRIEF\} (ORB)) and neural networks, respectively. It also measures the key parameters for gardening such as temperature, humidity, heat level, wind speed, wind direction and soil moisture. The data acquired from the on-board sensors of the gardening rover are sent to the cloud storage platform on a regular basis. Based on the acquired data and history, future predictions are made to maintain the garden more effectively and efficiently. A website and an android application are developed for monitoring and controlling the rover from a remote area. This system is a combination of new technologies involving an interdisciplinary approach to carry out precision gardening using Internet of Things (IoT). "

Data produced by such sensors can be used for several purposes and by different actors, such as doctors, patients, relatives, and health care centers, in order to provide remote assistance to users. However, major challenges arise mainly in terms of the interoperability among several heterogeneous devices from a variety of manufacturers. In this context, we introduce EcoHealth (Ecosystem of Health Care Devices), a Web middleware platform for connecting doctors and patients using attached body sensors, thus aiming to provide improved health monitoring and diagnosis for patients. This platform is able to integrate information obtained from heterogeneous sensors in order to provide mechanisms to monitor, process, visualize, store, and send notifications regarding patients’ conditions and vital signs at real-time by using Internet standards. In this paper, we present blueprints of our proposal to EcoHealth and its logical architecture and implementation, as well as an e-health motivational scenario where such a platform would be useful.

In practice, the \{VLC\} can utilize the lighting system infrastructure to transmit data via light intensity together with illumination. Several \{VLC\} standards have been published by the visible light communication consortium (VLCC) and the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) in 2003 and 2011 respectively. In the past five years, many researchers in Thailand have focused on both \{VLC\} basic research and technology implementation.

To make the components of the systems act intelligently, according to users’ needs, and understand and predict behavior of the cyber-physical systems, the cyber-physical systems need reasoning to link the outcome of the different components to be able to make use of the devices in the surrounding environment. The reasoning includes collecting sensor data, finding key concepts in the data and drawing conclusions that cyber-physical systems can use to control the components surrounding the users. However, there is a range of different components in a system where each has particular communication input-output and its own set tasks, which provides particular challenges associated with controlling or predicting the behavior of such systems, which require a kind of analytic tools. This paper presents reasoning strategies for smart cyber-physical systems that can extract and combine data, information, and knowledge to provide an intelligent behavior from users point of view.

Cyber-attacks on \{CMS\} are not just limited to attacks on its computing sphere. Cross-domain attacks over both the physical and the computing spheres become critical. A taxonomy has been developed to specify the nature of the attacks, particularly when they are cross-domain. The taxonomy can help security professionals identify and detect cross-domain attacks in CMS. The taxonomy has been constructed in four dimensions: attack vector, attack impact, attack target, and attack consequence. To illustrate how the taxonomy can be utilized in detecting cross-domain attacks on CMS, infill malicious attacks on 3D printing processes are used as an example. "

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation. "

Although there are many proposals for handling real-time traffic in WSNs, most of them fall into best-effort mechanisms that do not provide real-time guarantees. At the \{MAC\} level, the \{IEEE\} 802.15.4 standard defines a reservation mechanism called Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) that uses a first-come first-served service policy, which is not enough to ensure the real-time delivery of packets. In this work, we present a formal definition of the scheduling problem for a sensor network using a reservation mechanism (such as GTS) that provides guarantees for the real-time delivery of packets. We also present a heuristic approach for finding feasible schedules when possible or determining if the requirements of a set of sensors are not feasible. "

These emerge from innovations in information technology that, while they create new economic and social opportunities, pose challenges to our security and expectations of privacy. Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and private, will access a web of interconnected data from \{GPS\} location to weather and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges. Their implementation is essential for a Smart City in which we would wish to live. We also present a model representing the interactions between person, servers and things. Those are the major element in the Smart City and their interactions are what we need to protect. "

While both literature streams deal with servitization, their conceptual underpinnings and use of key terms are fundamentally different and have become confused within literature. This lack of clarity and understanding presents a challenge to both research and practice. The paper asks what the points of convergence and divergence are between the two streams of literature. The extant literature is reviewed to identify and understand where and how the streams converge and diverge. A two-tiered thematic analysis with both semantic and latent theme analysis is employed. Our findings highlight five points of departure, as well as highlighting examples where both logics have been applied. The five points of departure are the differing conceptualisations of: Value-in-Use, Design of the Servitized Offering, Value Co-production and Value Co-creation, Contextual Variety and Complexity, and Business Model of Solutions and Outcomes. We also propose conditions under which one logic may be more appropriate, in particular we find that adoption of a goods-dominant logic and service-dominant logic are better suited to the pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness, respectively. Finally, we identify future research directions, particularly within the domain of the Internet-of-Things. "

IoT promises to connect all physical “things” via a dynamic global network infrastructure and create intelligent behaviors in different contexts without human manipulations. In line with this development, the number of IoT solutions also have augmented exponentially covering many domains from health care, urban management to life quality improvement and so forth. However, separate appearances of these solutions today has led to barriers in enlarging smart environments because they lack a mechanism for integration. It is well-known that in the very near future, IoT requires the capabilities of high scale and dynamic adaptation with linking many new and existing smart contexts together. Hence, the need of having a comprehensive management method for the large-scale IoT environments is urgent at the time. In this paper, we focus on designing an overlay management architecture based on Chord algorithm to manage things in heterogeneous space. The architecture is a collection of multiple peer Chord rings, and thus each of these rings is considered as a smart context. We also bring forward operation mechanisms for the architecture such as thing identification, key insert/remove, key lookup and node joining/leave. Our proposed architecture is simulated and evaluated with diverse properties. The gained results showed the feasibility of our approach in reality meeting scalability, robustness and maintainability requirements applying to manage and control cyber-physical systems. "

Also, these sensors’ data will be used as behavioral data of dementia patients. In addition, we conducted a questionnaire about their habits and personalities. These questionnaires’ results were used as an attribute data of the subjects. The system analyzes the two data and then determines the presence or the absence of dementia. "

Recent advances in electronics, wireless communication and software are expected to open the door to a new era of densely connected devices sharing information worldwide, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), in which Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role. The combined use of IoT/WSNs together with industrial sensors in \{SHM\} provide an ad-hoc, inexpensive and easy way of deploying a monitoring system, where data can be shared among different entities. \{SHM\} requirements are challenging and diverse and therefore several different technologies may be used in the same deployment. At the same time the use of a middleware can substantially simplify and speed up the development of applications for SHM. Taking into account the challenges of \{SHM\} systems, this paper provides a review of the most novel and relevant wireless technologies and a state-of-the-art middleware for \{WSNs\} focusing on \{SHM\} specific requirements.

The study of animal behavior using smartphones requires the storage of many high frequency variables from a large number of individuals and their processing through various relevant variables combinations for modeling and decision-making. Transferring, storing, treating and sharing such an amount of data is a big challenge. In this paper, a lambda cloud architecture and a scientific sharing platform used to archive and process high-frequency data are proposed. An application to the study of cattle behavior on pasture on the basis of the data recorded with the \{IMU\} of iPhones 4S is exemplified. The package comes also with a web interface to encode the actual behavior observed on videos and to synchronize observations with the sensor signals. Finally, the use of fog computing on the iPhone reduced by 42% on average the size of the raw data by eliminating redundancies. "

Despite business process languages, such as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN2.0) do not foresee quality of information aspects, recent works extend the BPMN2.0 to include them. This way, the definition of process models can include quality requirements and process execution can be adapted considering these criteria. In this paper we take a step forward by bringing access cost information (e.g. energy consumption) to the business process level. Quality of information cannot be assessed alone due to its interdependency with access cost (e.g. increasing sensor sampling rate will improve not only information quality but also energy consumption). Therefore, quality of information and access cost can be used in process definitions, as well as to optimize and adapt process execution. Additionally, changing quality and cost requirements can also influence physical resources behavior at runtime as, for instance, in dealing with unexpected exceptions. Hence, processes can control and make tradeoffs regarding quality of information and access cost. "

The term Industry 4.0 initiates from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government. Such project advocates the computerization of the manufacturing industry. It is also known as the 4th industrial revolution. Precisely speaking, industry 4.0 is based on the technological concepts of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT), which enables the Factory of the Future (FoF). Within the modular structured smart factories of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the IoT, Cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real time. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are considered the backbone for the Industry 4.0. Thus, this paper attempts to answer the research question: “Are today's \{ERP\} systems ready for the FoF?”.

The definition of such complexity is cumbersome, time consuming and deviates the process modeler from the main flow. In this paper we propose an alternative to model expected exceptions, allowing the process modeler to focus on the right process. We propose the process invariants concept, which allows a process modeler to deﬁne a set of conditions that must remain valid within a process scope. Additionally, we implement our proposal by extending \{BPMN\} with process invariants. "

IoT services are a key solution for providing smart environments in homes, buildings, and cities. In the era of massive number of connected things and objects with high growth rate, several challenges have been raised, such as management, aggregation, and storage for big produced data. To address some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to the IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT), which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large-scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be considered in the design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying a suitable “Middleware” which sits between things and applications as a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and characteristics of middlewares. Next, we study different architecture styles and service domains. Then, we presents several middlewares that are suitable for CoT-based platforms and finally, a list of current challenges and issues in the design of CoT-based middlewares are discussed. "

Nonetheless, how to fully exploit the value of ‘big infrastructure data’ is still a key challenge facing most stakeholders.

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.

Despite operating in a relatively mature industry, companies in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software segment are still influenced by revenue driven valuations. The nature of the industry, with low delivery costs and high personnel costs, and the on-going switch from packaged software revenues towards “as a service” revenues protect the importance of revenues in this segment. With the development of the sector, the valuation drivers (key operating performance indicators) shift from revenue growth to profitability. In the \{ERP\} software segment top line growth remains the key driver especially with emergence of the Internet of Things and the concept of “Industry 4.0”, where an increasing number of devices are interconnected and can communicate with each other. The article analyses through regression analysis the current revenue and operating profitability based valuation levels of thirteen publicly listed in the \{ERM\} software segments against several key operating performance indicators. The results of our research show that future expected revenue growth remains the most important key operating performance indicator and both revenue and profitability driven valuations remain relevant. These findings are especially important for investors in the \{ERM\} software segment which are looking to sell their companies or to raise additional capital. "

Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based \{DTLS\} handshake protocol as it is the main \{IP\} security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a \{TI\} SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The \{CC2538\} module integrated into the \{TI\} board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.

Modern day cities are deprived of vital elements like quality of life and socio-economic development which can be delivered by the smart cities. Smart cities are an endeavour to make cities more efficient, sustainable and liveable. In other words, a smart city is a city that can monitor and integrate functionality of all the critical infrastructure like roads, tunnels, airways, waterways, railways, communication power supply, etc., control maintenance activities and can help in optimizing the resources while keeping an eye on the security issues as well. This research paper explores various aspects and dimensions of a smart city. To bridge the gap in literature regarding the concept of smart cities and its implementation, a framework has been developed to get better insights about the idea of smart city. On the basis of extensive and deep research of literature from diverse domains, we have identified six significant pillars for developing the framework as: Social, Management, Economic, Legal, Technology and Sustainability (SMELTS). The paper throws light upon how these factors can make the smart city initiative a successful project. The proposed framework has been used to figure out various agendas for research and traces its practical implications. "

In this paper, we present the fundamental theory of the nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations. In the Maxwell's displacement current, the first term ε 0 ∂ E ∂ t gives the birth of electromagnetic wave, which is the foundation of wireless communication, radar and later the information technology. Our study indicates that the second term ∂ P ∂ t in the Maxwell's displacement current is directly related to the output electric current of the nanogenerator, meaning that our nanogenerators are the applications of Maxwell's displacement current in energy and sensors. By contrast, electromagnetic generators are built based on Lorentz force driven flow of free electrons in a conductor. This study presents the similarity and differences between pieozoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, as well as the classical electromagnetic generator, so that the impact and uniqueness of the nanogenerators can be clearly understood. We also present the three major applications of nanogenerators as micro/nano-power source, self-powered sensors and blue energy. "

The options of using a mobile applications, Internet of Things, data gathering and their real time evaluation and their sharing. We present those solutions that combine traditional knowledge and modern technologies. The results are innovative and advanced ergonomic tools based on Industry 4.0 concept. Electronic tools are a new direction in ergonomics. With the support of mobile applications we see a way to create healthy conditions at work for production and also non-production workers, assembly and logistics. At the beginning of 20-th century, majority of us had no idea what the ergonomics is, how many risks occur during our job that they are connected with the health of employees and have not known that special methods and tools for their identification, analysis, evaluation and identification are developed. With the growing development of society we got to stadium when, luckily, majority of companies – employers even know the meaning of ergonomics or work risks, about risks at their workplaces and establish their evaluation and try to eliminate them. We have many methods and tools of modern ergonomics which enable us to realize analysis and optimization of employee's work to their benefit. Considering experience we can surely claim that we know the main problem of these days. It is requisite to realize ergonomic evaluation perfectly, extensively and mainly quickly. Slowness of some solutions discourages managers and directors and makes effective improving of work conditions impossible. The idea of mobile application developing which works as a screening tool came with demands from big companies that have dozens of workplaces and cannot identify work risks by themselves. Ceit \{ERgonomics\} Analysis Application, which is described in article, is output of our own research and development. It is a mobile application developed in \{CEIT\} Company in collaboration with the University of Žilina and Slovak ergonomic association. It is a screening evaluation of space conditions and work positions of workers at potentially risky workplaces. It is developed at the base of legislation and technical norms, at our own platform, with the support of virtual and augmented reality. The main goal of evaluation by the \{CERAA\} usage is to find out if the workplace is risky from the ergonomic view. It is an innovative way of applied augmented reality tools during the ergonomic evaluation of chosen workplaces. Nowadays, the new submodules are being developed. They will identify risks at administrative workplaces, submodule which will evaluate working with loads and other that will evaluate repetitive operations. \{CERAA\} is used in several industrial companies in Slovakia and Czech Republic from the second half of 2016.

An insecure communication channel between a tag and a reader makes the \{RFID\} implant system vulnerable to attacks and endangers the user's safety and privacy. The proposed scheme relies on elliptic curve cryptography and the D-Quark lightweight hash design. Compared to the available public-key cryptosystems, elliptic curve-based cryptosystems are the best choice due to their small key sizes as well as their efficiency in computations. The D-Quark lightweight hash design is tailored for resource constrained pervasive devices, cost, and performance. The security analysis of the proposed authentication scheme revealed that it is secure against the relevant threat models and provides a higher security level than related work found in the literature. The computational performance comparison shows that our work has 48% less communication overhead compared to existing similar schemes. It also requires 24% less total memory than the other approaches. The required computational time of our scheme is generally similar to other existing schemes. Hence, the presented scheme is a well-suited choice for providing security for the resource-constrained \{RFID\} implant systems. "

Moreover, it enables to access all collected data in the local LR-WPAN coverage area – which is named as Senspot in this paper – by third-party clients through the Internet. Furthermore, an analytic model has been developed for the integrated network to evaluate the system's performance.

Sport Internet of Things (IoTs) based on the sensor technique and modern communication technology are becoming more and more important to current sport training and daily activities. Sensor-based sport monitoring approaches lead people to take advantage of the wearable sport devices to monitor their own physiological parameters, in which we will focus on the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse measurement. In order to measure these two parameters, we will adopt near-infrared portable tissue oximeter with detection module using \{STM32\} microprocessor. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is becoming a widely used research instrument to measure tissue oxygen (O2) status non-invasively. Continuous-wave spectrometers are the most commonly used devices, which provide semi-quantitative changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in small blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries and venules). Through the measurement using the near-infrared technology, we could obtain the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse parameters. After obtaining the above two parameters, the portable device will send the data to the remote coaches or doctors via GPRS/WiFi/Zigbee networks. The data of the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse that is detected by the detection module are processed by the expert decision-making system in order to provide the coaches and doctors with the athlete condition. In addition, the data can be sent to the smart phones of the players, coaches or doctors through GPRS/WiFi networks, in which the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse data of the athletes can be displayed according to the requirement of the remote users.

Among many biometric traits, fingerprint-based identification systems have been extensively studied and deployed. However, to adopt biometric identification systems in practical applications, two main obstacles in terms of efficiency and client privacy must be resolved simultaneously. That is, identification should be performed at an acceptable time, and only a client should have access to his/her biometric traits, which are not revocable if leaked. Until now, multiple studies have demonstrated successful protection of client biometric data; however, such systems lack efficiency that leads to excessive time utilization for identification. The most recently researched scheme shows efficiency improvements but reveals client biometric traits to other entities such as biometric database server. This violates client privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving fingerprint identification scheme by using cloud systems. The proposed scheme extensively exploits the computation power of a cloud so that most of the laborious computations are performed by the cloud service provider. According to our experimental results on an Amazon \{EC2\} cloud, the proposed scheme is faster than the existing schemes and guarantees client privacy by exploiting symmetric homomorphic encryption. Our security analysis shows that during identification, the client fingerprint data is not disclosed to the cloud service provider or fingerprint database server. "

Furthermore the global change towards a fully networked society is in progress, in Germany, in Europe, and of course in the United States – actually more or less all over the world. In this context one significant topic is the “Internet of things and services”. The digital transformation changes business and private life likewise – in a radically and sustainable way. The economic potential is enormous. Topics related to the networking of the internet by far have the most economical potential worldwide. The world becomes more and more digital.

But not only in technology many things are changing, humans and the society transforms, too.

Although cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, cyberwars are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective. "

The study was launched in December 2015 in Tokyo, Japan, and the participating countries and regions engaged in preparations for the study during the course of 2016, including patient registration and creation of databases for the purpose of the study. The Second A-CaP Meeting was held on September 8, 2016 in Seoul, Korea, with the participation of members and collaborators from 12 countries and regions. Under the study, each participating country or region will begin registration of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and conduct prognostic investigations. From the data gathered, common research themes will be identified, such as comparisons among Asian countries of background factors in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. This is the first Asia-wide study of prostate cancer and has developed from single country research efforts in this field, including in Japan and Korea. At the Second Meeting, participating countries and regions discussed the status of preparations and discussed various issues that are being faced. These issues include technical challenges in creating databases, promoting participation in each country or region, clarifying issues relating to data input, addressing institutional issues such as institutional review board requirements, and the need for dedicated data managers. The meeting was positioned as an opportunity to share information and address outstanding issues prior to the initiation of the study. In addition to A-CaP-specific discussions, a series of special lectures was also delivered as a means of providing international perspectives on the latest developments in prostate cancer and the use of databases and registration studies around the world.

Although the general requirements of 5G systems are progressively taking shape, the technological issues raised by such a vision are still partially unclear. Nonetheless, general consensus has been reached upon some specific challenges, such as the need for 5G wireless access networks to support massive access by MTDs, as a consequence of the proliferation of \{M2M\} services. In this paper, we describe the main challenges raised by the \{M2M\} vision, focusing in particular on the problems related to the support of massive \{MTD\} access in current cellular communication systems. Then we analyze the most common approaches proposed in the literature to enable the coexistence of conventional and \{M2M\} services in the current and next generation of cellular wireless systems. We finally conclude by pointing out the research challenges that require further investigation in order to provide full support to the \{M2M\} paradigm. "

Indeed, it is argued that the so-called ‘Smart Mobility’ transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed – will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.

Drawn upon the concept of socio-technical imaginaries we explore the discourses of social actors regarding the implementation of \{SG\} in the European Union, from policy makers, industry and consumer perspectives. In order to do so, we use knowledge assessment, a qualitative approach that looks into the pedigree of the knowledge input in policy processes and its quality in terms of fitness for purpose and function. Through the analysis of \{EU\} policy documents related to \{SG\} and interviews conducted with relevant social actors, we looked at the official visions about \{SG\} coming from the policy sphere, the main supporters of the \{SG\} vision and proposal. We looked into discourses, factual or imaginary argumentation and justifications, promises, motivations, appeals to the public and other narrative elements that scaffold the \{SG\} vision in Europe. We conclude that the \{SG\} proposal is aligned with current innovation narratives in the \{EU\} but presents some disconnects with citizen debates. "

We work under the hypothesis that a risk-prone situation produces sudden and significant deviations in standard physiological and behavioural user patterns. These changes can be captured by a group of sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate. We introduce a dataset, called PRIDE, which provides a baseline for the development and the fair comparison of personal risk detection mechanisms. \{PRIDE\} contains information on 18 test subjects; for each subject, it includes partial information about the user’s behavioural and physiological patterns, as captured by Microsoft Band©. \{PRIDE\} test subject records include sensor readings of not only when a subject is carrying out ordinary daily life activities, but also when exposed to a stressful scenario, thereby simulating a dangerous or abnormal situation. We show how to use \{PRIDE\} to develop a personal risk detection mechanism; to accomplish this, we have tackled risk detection as a one-class classification problem. We have trained several classifiers based only on the daily behaviour of test subjects. Further, we tested the accuracy of the classifiers to detect anomalies that were not included in the training process of the classifiers. We used a number of one-class classifiers, namely: SVM, Parzen, and two versions of Parzen based on k-means. While there is still room for improvement, our results are encouraging: they support our hypothesis that abnormal behaviour can be automatically detected. "

An important remaining challenge now is to extract meaningful information from the ever-increasing amount of sensor data collected by WSNs. In particular, there is strong interest in algorithms capable of automatic detection of patterns, events or other out-of-the order, anomalous system behavior. Data anomalies may indicate states of the system that require further analysis or prompt actions. Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are executed in a central processing facility, which requires the collection of all measurement data at a central location, an obvious limitation for \{WSNs\} due to the high data communication costs involved. In this paper we explore the extent by which one may depart from this classical centralized paradigm, looking at decentralized anomaly detection based on unsupervised machine learning. Our aim is to detect anomalies at the sensor nodes, as opposed to centrally, to reduce energy and spectrum consumption. We study the information gain coming from aggregate neighborhood data, in comparison to performing simple, in-node anomaly detection. We evaluate the effects of neighborhood size and spatio-temporal correlation on the performance of our new neighborhood-based approach using a range of real-world network deployments and datasets. We find the conditions that make neighborhood data fusion advantageous, identifying also the cases in which this approach does not lead to detectable improvements. Improvements are linked to the diffusive properties of data (spatio-temporal correlations) but also to the type of sensors, anomalies and network topological features. Overall, when a dataset stems from a similar mixture of diffusive processes precision tends to benefit, particularly in terms of recall. Our work paves the way towards understanding how distributed data fusion methods may help managing the complexity of wireless sensor networks, for instance in massive Internet of Things scenarios. "

It constitutes, thus, a valuable case of development and diffusion of effective user-centric privacy enhancing technologies and a first tool to allow individuals to enjoy the immaterial wealth of their personal data in the data economy. Indeed, a free portability of personal data from one controller to another can be a strong tool for data subjects in order to foster competition of digital services and interoperability of platforms and in order to enhance controllership of individuals on their own data. However, the adopted formulation of the right to data portability in the \{GDPR\} could benefit from further clarification: several interpretations are possible, particularly with regard to the object of the right and its interrelation with other rights, potentially leading to additional challenges within its technical implementation. The aim of this article is to propose a first systematic interpretation of this new right, by suggesting a pragmatic and extensive approach, particularly taking advantage as much as possible of the interrelationship that this new legal provision can have with regard to the Digital Single Market and the fundamental rights of digital users. In sum, the right to data portability can be approximated under two different perspectives: the minimalist approach (the adieu scenario) and the empowering approach (the fusing scenario), which the authors consider highly preferable.

After a presentation of the existing models, the paper discusses the new approaches, addressing both commercial and institutional markets. New concepts for the very high resolution markets, in Europe and in the US, are the main focus of this analysis. Two complementary perspectives are summarised: on the one hand, the type of system and its operational performance and, on the other, the related business models, concepts of operation and ownership schemes. Until now, Earth observation systems for the most critical institutional needs are mainly dedicated assets owned and operated by governments or public organisations, often at national level. Even in the case of dual use missions, the governmental and commercial operations are in general fully segregated for the very high resolution satellites. Recent evolutions could affect this paradigm. Firstly, the increased performance of commercial satellites has a high degree of convergence with defence needs: 25–30 cm resolution is now the benchmark or at least a very short term target for commercial missions. The second evolution is the development of hybrid procurement schemes, combining proprietary missions and data buy framework contracts, partly triggered by the budgetary constraints of public customers, some failures in the execution of large spy satellites contracts and by the willingness to foster the competitiveness of industry on the export market. New space is another trend, which is more disruptive. This trend begun in the Silicon Valley and spread worldwide, arousing our expectations, sometimes excessively. This new model involves not only start-ups but also big web actors with substantial investment capacity. Both aim to transforming space into a commodity, taking benefit from the convergence between Information technology and EO. Beside the massive constellations for broadband Internet access, some initiatives have been launched for Earth observation markets, targeting high resolution and high revisit. Last but not least, more and more countries, the newcomers, invest in their own \{EO\} capacity, confirming the soft power dimension of space but also opening new opportunities for international or regional cooperation. As many unpredictable events may occur, even in a short time frame, the last part of the paper has a prospective dimension. Based on market trends and industrial stakes, it discusses the realism and likelihood of possible scenarios and identifies their impacts on the \{EO\} landscape and the main stakeholders involved, in particular in Europe: – The governmental and institutional actors, using Earth observation data for their operational missions, with an evolving balance between sovereign assets and external services. – The commercial operators of very high resolution satellites, with the new market opportunities and the possible emergence of worldwide champions. – The satellite manufacturers and their competitiveness. – The role of nations and space agencies, including the non-dependence or national sovereignty and international cooperation dimensions. Based on the comparison of three “radical” scenarios, the conclusion shows that there are opportunities for service providers and satellite manufacturers. Even without clear answer to the future industrial, technical and political structure of \{EO\} systems, relevant indicators to be monitored during the next three-five years are identified. The last section focuses on Europe and the role of institutions in order to support European champions and small and medium companies in the new worldwide competition. "

In many cases, consumers may have incomplete information or may be inattentive about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy policies, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers’ privacy actions and attitudes. Results of an online survey experiment indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing sensitive and identifiable information, even when positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy are made salient, compared to when privacy is not mentioned. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information. Rather, people are inattentive and their dormant privacy concerns may manifest only when consumers are asked to think about privacy. "

In light of the increasingly blurred lines among different categories of testing, I call for a broader discussion of \{DTC\} governance. I stress the importance of shifting our attention from the activities of the most prominent companies to viewing \{DTC\} genetics as an industry with a wide spectrum of services and raising a wide variety of issues. These issues go beyond questions of clinical utility and validity to those of data security, personal identity, race, and the nature of the family. Robust \{DTC\} testing has the power to provide meaningful clinical, genealogical and even forensic information to those who want it; in unscrupulous hands, however, it also has the power to deceive and exploit. I consider approaches to help ensure the former and minimize the latter. "

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of \{BDA\} tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly \{BD\} tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the \{BDA\} landscape. Given the significant nature of the \{BD\} and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the \{BD\} challenges and \{BDA\} methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on \{BD\} and \{BDA\} area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: \{Q1\} – What are the different types of \{BD\} challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and \{Q2\} – What are the different types of \{BDA\} methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome \{BD\} challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the \{BDA\} research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of \{BD\} strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant \{BD\} research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the \{BDA\} in technology and organizational resource management discipline.

In the context of big data, the success of healthcare applications solely depends on the underlying architecture and utilization of appropriate tools as evidenced in pioneering research attempts. Novel research works have been carried out for deriving application specific healthcare frameworks that offer diversified data analytical capabilities for handling sources of data ranging from electronic health records to medical images. In this paper, we have presented various analytical avenues that exist in the patient-centric healthcare system from the perspective of various stakeholders.

The transformation of physical systems into cyber-physical systems (CPS) by imbibing them with intelligence is an ongoing process that can substantially benefit the society and the environment by improving comfort, convenience and quality of life of the people, while reducing consumption of natural resources and reducing environmental footprint. Examples of cyber physical systems are Smart Grid Networks, Smart Transportation System, Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure, Utility Service Infrastructure for Smart Cities, etc. But, the inherent dangers in this transformation are: it allows flexible control and resource use; provides conduits for information leakage; prone to misconfigurations and deliberate attacks by outsiders and insiders.

Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification \{RFID\} scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.

In departing from the traditional centralized model of manufacturing, decentralized manufacturing divides production across sites or geographic regions. This paradigm shift imposes significant structural and organisational changes on a business presenting both hidden challenges that must be addressed and opportunities to be embraced. By profoundly adapting business practices, significant advantages can be realized through a democratized value chain, creation of professional-level jobs without geographic restriction to the central hub and a flexibility in response to external pressures and demands. To realize these potential opportunities, however, advances in manufacturing technology and support systems are required, as well as significant changes in the way \{CGTs\} are regulated to facilitate multi-site manufacturing. Decentralized manufacturing is likely to be the manufacturing platform of choice for advanced health care therapies—in particular, those with a high degree of personalization. The future success of these promising products will be enhanced by adopting sound business strategies early in development. To realize the benefits that decentralized manufacturing of \{CGTs\} has to offer, it is important to examine both the risks and the substantial opportunities present. In this research, we examine both the challenges and the opportunities this shift in business strategy represents in an effort to maximize the success of adoption. "

This data can be badly expressed, understood, and exploited by other systems and devices. Additionally, the huge amount of connected objects embeds with resource-constrained devices (sensors, actuators, RFIDS, etc.) are also challenging. Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology. The second contribution is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of this ontology. In fact, an IoT Medicare system is proposed to evaluate the HealthIoT ontology. "

Systematic performance management of healthcare processes is important in determining if quality of care goals are being met at all levels of the healthcare ecosystem. The challenge is that reaching these goals requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system. In this paper, we review various cloud computing applications for surveillance and performance management of quality of care in healthcare. We also introduce a framework for achieving systematic surveillance and performance management across the entire healthcare system. "

The differences between city intelligence in China and the “smart city” concept in other countries are compared to highlight and contrast the unique definition and model for China's city intelligence in this paper. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of urban big data in city intelligence by showing that it not only serves as the cornerstone of this trend as it also plays a core role in the diffusion of city intelligence technology and serves as an inexhaustible resource for the sustained development of city intelligence. This study also points out the challenges of shaping and developing of China's urban big data. Considering the supporting and core role that urban big data plays in city intelligence, the study then expounds on the key points of urban big data, including infrastructure support, urban governance, public services, and economic and industrial development. Finally, this study points out that the utility of city intelligence as an ideal policy tool for advancing the goals of China's urban development. In conclusion, it is imperative that China make full use of its unique advantages—including using the nation's current state of development and resources, geographical advantages, and good human relations—in subjective and objective conditions to promote the development of city intelligence through the proper application of urban big data.

Objectives In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25 years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges. Discussion Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis. Conclusions Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.

A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets. "

However, prevalent security concerns still hinder the integration of sensor networks and cloud computing. In this paper, we show how recent progress in standardization can provide the basis for protecting data from diverse sensor devices when outsourcing data processing and storage to the cloud. To this end, we present our Sensor Cloud Security Library (SCSlib) that enables cloud service developers to transparently access cryptographically protected sensor data in the cloud. \{SCSlib\} specifically allows domain specialists who are not security experts to build secure cloud services.

This aim is also known as mass customization and is characterized by handling a high level of complexity with a total network integration of products and production processes. These technology-driven changes also lead to new fields of activity in the industrial science and the occupational psychology. The 4th industrial revolution intends to implement the collaboration between humans and machines. At the same time, processes are locally controlled and planned. For humans, this results to new work items. Resulting psychological effects should be investigated. This paper classifies the 4th industrial revolution systematically and describes future changes for employees. It derives the necessity of labor- psychological analysis of new key technologies like cyber physical systems.

The agents can be deployed in large scale and hierarchical network environments crossing barriers transparently. The networks can consist of high- and low-resource nodes ranging from generic computers to microchips, and the supported network classes range from body area networks to the Internet including any kind of sensor and ambient network. Agents are represented by mobile program code that can be modified at run-time. The presented approach enables the development of sensor clouds and smart systems of the future integrated in daily use computing environments and the Internet. Agents can migrate between different hardware and software platforms by migrating the program code of the agent, embedding the state and the data of an agent, too. The entire information exchange and coordination of agents with other agents and the environment is performed by using a tuple space database. Beside architecture specific hardware and software implementations of the agent processing platform, there is a JavaScript (JS) implemen- tation layered on the top of a distributed management layer. The \{JS\} platform enables the integration of Multi-agent Systems (MAS) in Internet server and application environments (e.g., \{WEB\} browser). Agents can migrate transparently between hardware-level sensor networks and \{WEB\} browser applications or network servers and vice versa without any transformation required. "

An assessment of their perceptions and practice of cervical screening could reveal gaps that would inspire efforts to improve key indicators among them and in turn, the general population. Methods This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 316 workers of a tertiary health facility selected by stratified random sampling with proportionate allocation. Data was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires and analysed with \{SPSS\} 20 and \{PEPI\} programs. Results The majority of respondents were aware of cervical cancer but it was significantly higher among females, p=.001. Most respondents, 266 (84.2%) were less than 40 years of age but knowledge of cervical cancer screening diminished with increase in age, p=.039. Only 92 (29%) had good knowledge of cervical screening; a better knowledge of cervical screening was significantly associated with working in a clinical department, employment duration of less than 2 years, and being female. All females who had ever screened for Ca cervix, 18 (11%) had a Pap smear, and majority 15 (83%) had screened only once. Factors associated with screening were level of education, years of work experience, and being in a clinical department. Reasons given for not screening included pain from the procedure, its cost, and the delay with getting results. Conclusion Knowledge of cervical screening was not good among staff of \{DELSUTH\} and practice of screening was also very poor. They may benefit from health education and promotion programmes directed towards better screening practices. Introduction of easier-to-perform and less costly screening modalities like VIA/VILI may also improve uptake. "

However, the application of regulatory bioinformatics also poses new challenges and requires new knowledge and skill sets. In the latest Global Coalition on Regulatory Science Research (GCRSR) governed conference, Global Summit on Regulatory Science (GSRS2015), regulatory bioinformatics principles were presented with respect to global trends, initiatives and case studies. The discussion revealed that datasets, analytical tools, skills and expertise are rapidly developing, in many cases via large international collaborative consortia. It also revealed that significant research is still required to realize the potential applications of regulatory bioinformatics. While there is significant excitement in the possibilities offered by precision medicine to enhance treatments of serious and/or complex diseases, there is a clear need for further development of mechanisms to securely store, curate and share data, integrate databases, and standardized quality control and data analysis procedures. A greater understanding of the biological significance of the data is also required to fully exploit vast datasets that are becoming available. The application of bioinformatics in the microbiological risk analysis paradigm is delivering clear benefits both for the investigation of food borne pathogens and for decision making on clinically important treatments. It is recognized that regulatory bioinformatics will have many beneficial applications by ensuring high quality data, validated tools and standardized processes, which will help inform the regulatory science community of the requirements necessary to ensure the safe introduction and effective use of these applications.

In this regard, a key aspect is the lack of a public repository of movement datasets that can be employed by the researchers as a common reference to compare and assess their proposals. This work describes UMAFall, a new dataset of movement traces acquired through the systematic emulation of a set of predefined \{ADLs\} (Activities of Daily Life) and falls. In opposition to other existing databases for FDSs, which only include the signals captured by one or two sensing points, the testbed deployed for the generation of \{UMAFall\} dataset incorporated five wearable sensing points, which were located on five different points of the body of the participants that developed the movements. As a consequence, the obtained data offer an interesting tool to investigate the importance of the sensor placement for the effectiveness of the detection decision in FDSs. "

The analysis is based on a typical architecture starting from a single sensor and actuator and continuing to the virtualized services at smart dust, dew, fog and cloud level. The system is diverse and allows interconnection of different sensors/ actuators technologies directly or throughout gateways. The experiments in a living lab presented use energy harvesters and ZigBee \{PRO\} sensors. The results from sensor network are applicable for non-real-time and non-critical data connection. As a final conclusion, we claim that for critical and non-critical measurements that need to be supported in a typical living environment there is a necessity to use different priorities of the services and different sensors as well.

This paper focuses on existing trends in the development of industrial big data analytics and CPS. Then it briefly discusses a systematic architecture for applying \{CPS\} in manufacturing called 5C. The 5C architecture includes necessary steps to fully integrate cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing industry.

This research investigates the use of residential energy use data and smart connected thermostat data to continuously monitor the health and performance of residential \{HVAC\} systems. Using field-collected \{HVAC\} energy consumption and performance data to develop a process-history based model, the results of this research suggest that the use of this methodology can save up to 6% of annual energy use of residential buildings.

Moreover, Broker-Less TinyDDS (BLTDDS) and Hybrid TinyDDS (HyTDDS)8 are other proposed protocols which have added several improvements to the DefTDDS. In this paper, we investigate and evaluate DefTDDS, \{BLTDDS\} and HyTDDS approaches. We use TinyOS simulator (TOSSIM) and \{DDS\} standard to conduct our comparative study.

Water quality monitoring has thus become essential to the supply of clean and safe water. Conventional monitoring processes involve manual collection of samples from various points in the distribution network, followed by laboratory testing and analysis. This process has proved to be ineffective since it is laborious, time consuming and lacks real-time results to promote proactive response to water contamination. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have since been considered a promising alternative to complement conventional monitoring processes. These networks are relatively affordable and allow measurements to be taken remotely, in real-time and with minimal human intervention. This work surveys the application of \{WSN\} in environmental monitoring, with particular emphasis on water quality. Various \{WSN\} based water quality monitoring methods suggested by other authors are studied and analyzed, taking into account their coverage, energy and security concerns. The work also compares and evaluates sensor node architectures proposed the various authors in terms of monitored parameters, microcontroller/microprocessor units (MCU) and wireless communication standards adopted, localization, data security implementation, power supply architectures, autonomy and potential application scenarios.

Beyond the classic scenario of service provision, three scenarios of e-service provision are considered. First, “actor – e-service – actor”, where actors are humans, but e-service is provided remotely through a software platform, e.g., through social media. Second, a scenario, where an e-service is provided by software instead of a human: “software – e-service – actor”. An example of such a scenario is an e-banking website. In this case, the software remains under consumer control. Finally, a scenario where an e-service is provided by a software agent instead of a human or software. A software agent is a program that autonomously performs tasks in a given time and place according to predefined instructions of its owner; hence: “software agent – e-service – actor”. An example of such scenario is a software agent that selects ads in search engines. Such an agent can continuously operate in the background on the consumer's behalf, without the consumer's direct control. In concluding, the consequences of a shift from classical services to digital e-services on the education marketplace are discussed. "

Coupling this elevated risk of physical and technical aggression with the ever-increasing global per capita energy demand – there has been witnessed a continually growing reliance on nuclear energy for baseline power generation, a form of electricity production that requires both the necessary international safeguards and controls for its safe use. As more and more of the global energy budget is provided by low-carbon sources (over highly-polluting fossil fuels), the volume of nuclear material in existence will grow substantially – requiring considerable attention and policy to ensure its long-term safety and security.

The paper proposes an approach to model such network via a set of interacting socio-inspired services. Such services are capable to model behavior of the network participants taking into account their preferences, strategies and social norms. The interoperability of the services is achieved due to the usage of common standards (such as \{WSDL\} and SOAP) at the technological level, and common ontology at the semantic level.

Environmental sensing and monitoring initiatives will be gratified by new Information System (IS) architectures and collaboration protocols arising with Cloud Computing (CC) paradigm. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to: a) demonstrate that getting an efficient control and monitoring of Environmental Sensing, requires a Big Data processing and analysis capacity; b) enrich an existing proposal of a platform based on open source technology; and c) evidence the relevance of human aligned communication channels to assure the effectiveness of all system. Objectively, this paper proposes an innovative monitoring platform for Environmental Sensing, supported by a cloud and ubiquitous architecture, using Big Data processing capacity, towards an efficient, effective, sustainable and passive eco-environment, where human-to-human relations allows the essential co-creation and co-decision in this business area.

Although the reflection on a series of service encounters has increased, the scope of research in this space remains narrow. Service research has traditionally concentrated on understanding, measuring and optimizing the core service delivery. While this focused lens has generated extraordinary knowledge and moved service research and practice forward, it has also resulted in a narrowly focused research field. The authors present a framework to guide comprehensive service experience research. Broadly, they define (1) pre-core service encounter, (2) core service encounter, and (3) post-core service encounter as distinct periods within a service experience. Further, they review the literature and put forward important research questions to be addressed within and across these periods. Finally, they argue that researchers need to consider simultaneously all periods of the service experience to make valuable contributions to the literature. "

But due to the slow development of a scalable \{IT\} infrastructure, this can lead to issues in competitiveness. Software defined networking (SDN) can thereby counteract such issues by giving new functions to the whole network topology. With SDN, administrators have the possibility to abstract the underlying network infrastructure for applications and network services. The paper reports on the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on challenges and effects of SDN. It shows that most papers address the implementation of software defined networking as a challenge, including factors like vendor lock-in and the general risk of changing traditional network architectures. Attention is also given to security issues arising with software defined networks and the permanent high demand from the end-user combined with the fear of changing traditional networks. Issues dealing with specialized know-how were identified as another challenge category. Effects of \{SDN\} are discussed by defining unique features of \{SDN\} like decoupling hardware from the software and the global view of the whole network architecture. \{SDN\} furthermore affects the management of the network, including changes in deployment of policies, the programmability and maintenance of the network. Economic factors, such as cost efficiency and reduction of costs, are also discussed. "

Machine learning algorithms such as cluster analysis can be used to extract useful information and patterns from data generated from physical devices based on which novel applications of \{CPS\} can make informed decisions. In this paper we propose to use a density-based data stream clustering algorithm, built on the Multiple Species Flocking model, for the monitoring of big data, generated from numerous applications such as machine monitoring, health monitoring, sensor networks.

The Discrete Wavelet Transform in conjunction with a Random Forest classifier was able to successfully distinguish between the six training activities (98% accurate). Accurate sensor orientation in 3D space were estimated using a computationally efficient gradient decent algorithm and were utilized to calculate joint angles, which were temporally aligned using curve registration to facilitate inter-participant comparisons. An Analysis of Characterizing Phases was applied to the whole joint angle curve and showed a statistically significant difference in knee joint flexion-extension landing strategy between a participant with low back pain and nine uninjured participants. The presented end-to-end system has the potential to be used in the automatic extraction and analysis of movement technique and loading in various unconstrained environments for musculoskeletal injury management.

In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare.

It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria.

Such a change will have important benefits in the access to near real- time, large- scale up to population-wide data collection and analysis. However, there are numerous issues implied. Primarily of concern is how to ensure anonymity and privacy within these methodologies, and further the related issue of how to incentivize participants and remove barriers/concerns over participation. To address these concerns, in this paper we introduce a novel system to capture aggregate population health research data via utilizing smartphone capabilities while fully maintaining the anonymity and privacy of each individual contributing such data. A key and novel capability of this system is the support for customizable data collection; without the need to know specific details about an individual. The customized collection rules can be deployed on the local device based on detailed local data, and the resultant collection can be measured by the anonymous data collection network. In this paper we provide a conceptual architecture and describe a method for local processing of aggregate e-Research health data utilizing adaptive privacy thresholds to create a multi-party flexible approach to participatory data submission to support this novel health e-Research capability.

New emerging advanced therapies invest in genetic, electronics and cell-based therapy for addressing unmet needs for the caregivers and the patient. As digital process in health (eHealth) gains momentum, connected advanced bio-electronic devices now offer new strategies for personalized injection therapies. In this review, we take a journey along the genesis path of a new drug delivery system: the Optogenerapy, a synergy between optogenetic and gene therapy. Inside a bio-electronic implant, electronics and optogenetics are interfaced by light as a traceless inducer signal. By controlling a synthetic optogenetic pathway in the cell, therapeutics delivery can be fine-tuned with a precise spatiotemporal control. The technology holds promise of a new modern syringe era capable of producing a drug of interest at will directly inside the patient. "

We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application.

Several tactical and operational problems have been solved with our tool: a problem of planning activities with resources assignment for hospital systems, a lot-sizing and scheduling problem taking into account the setup time for plastic injection, and a scheduling problem with precedence constraints. At the strategic level, this tool can also be used as part of the Industry 4.0 to design reconfigurable production systems.

In addition we do away with video due to privacy concerns. In this paper we present the design challenges and issues in putting together a sensor network for obtaining micro-context information in multi-person smart spaces. In order to support greater levels of ambient intelligence we support fine grained spatio-temporal data and context acquisition. The architecture is being currently developed into a prototype in a modular fashion for deployment and testing in a variety of environments, and is being concurrently evaluated and tested in real conditions, prior to deployment in a facility for elderly residents with mild cognitive disorder.

While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.

However, IoV can also be extended to healthcare domain, where the patients can be provided healthcare services on-the-fly. We extend this novel concept in this paper and refer it as “Healthcare services on-the-fly”. The concept of game theory has been used among the vehicles to access the healthcare services while traveling. The vehicles act as players in the game and tend to form and split coalitions to access these services. Learning automata (LA) act as the players for interaction with the environment and take appropriate actions based on reward and penalty. Apart from this, Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling algorithm for efficient utilization of resources at cloud level has also been formulated. A stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model is used to represent the coalition formation and splitting with respect to availability of resources at cloud level. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the best, first, and random fit schemes. "

Research shows that the combined business models (products combined with services) have a positive effect on the business. Likewise, it is profitable to think strategically and in long term for enterprises offering maintenance services, especially using performance-based models. But for achieving these benefits the view of the business has to change. The focus should be on the values created and not in the offers in form of products or services. Moreover, the company needs to position itself as an actor not only in the value chain, but in a wider context referred to as the business ecosystem. Making such a shift of focus is hard though, and there is a need to understand both the current state of the business as well as the potential future directions. The framework presented in this paper is an attempt to meet these needs. The framework describes business model development in four levels. From maturity point of view, the four steps could be seen as the logical development of the business model from a narrow technical perspective to a holistic product-service perspective. The four levels could also be connected to the industrial development where level four supports Industry 4.0. Level four is referred to as Service Management 4.0. In particular, four key concepts reflect the concept of Service Management 4.0: the mix of products and services in customer offers, performance-based contracts, partnering and the business ecology concept.

As well as provide an automatic responses of suggestions and warnings to paramedic staff inside an ambulance. Sensor networks record and deliver health status information to other elements of system. Due to the availability of information from sensors networks, an auto response can take place by alarms supervised by Decision Maker unit. Remote decisions can be made in a medical center after receiving inputs generated inside an ambulance. Building a distributed real time system can handle all aspects of time critical systems and hide heterogeneity between elements and different types of data.

In order to address this problem, we first developed an analytical model, in which we could compare the \{SINR\} (Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio) values before and after the application of the clustering model and, later, in order to validate the model, we executed simulations and evaluated the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. We noticed significant improvements in the SINR, achieving about 80% of the Small Cells and keeping the battery consumption behavior stable. Through the simulations, we observed improvements in the quality of the service offered to the users, such as the reduction in the lag above 33%, as well as a drop in the number of lost packets. "

Different techniques and tools under the Industry 4.0 paradigm were already discussed in literature. These are aimed mostly at boosting company efficiency in terms of costs and environmental footprint. However, from a sustainability point of view, the social theme must be equally considered. While energy flows or costs can be already monitored in a production plant, this is not valid for data related to human effort. Monitoring systems aimed at supervising factory social sustainability were not already discussed in literature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to acquire social related data in a production plant. The method is supported by a smart architecture within the concept of IoT factory. Such architecture permits to monitor the parameters that could influence social sustainability in a production site. After a discussion on production plants facilities and features, the parameters that need to be considered to guarantee socially sustainable manufacturing processes are identified. A set of sensors controls these data taken from different sources, including operator vital signs. Operations as well as humans are monitored. Data acquired by sensors are collected by a central server. A decision maker can interpret the data and improve the production system from a social point of view, implementing corrective actions. Data can be exploited not only for social assessments but even for other analyses on the production system. Guaranteeing social sustainability could boost the factory productivity. A case study is included in the paper: smart sensors are implemented in a production line to understand the operations efficiency in terms of social sustainability. "

However, turning vast real-time data streams into actionable knowledge poses significant challenges. For instance, heterogeneous data from varied sources needs to be normalized and integrated, ideally using a common structured vocabulary. Furthermore, to provide users with both real-time and aggregate views on the data, data stream access requires support for temporal operators. Finally, it is difficult for non-technical users to integrate and leverage streaming data. To tackle these challenges, we propose an extension of the Linked Widgets concept for the streaming data domain. In this paper, we outline a platform prototype for the creation of streaming data mashups that is currently under development and illustrate its potential by means of a use case based on city real time bike data from the city of Vienna.

Therein, sustainability objectives, e.g., minimization of energy consumption/cost of production processes and stabilization of the electricity grid, can be achieved by manufacturing enterprises in a low-cost manner. However, these sustainability goals should be integrated with conventional production constraints besides the due date, e.g., reasonable labor cost based on work shifts, no production at weekends, and changeovers for different product types. This paper formulates a mixed-integer linear programming model for energy- and labor-cost-aware production scheduling at the unit process level, considering all the aforementioned constraints. A state-based energy model is used to reveal the energy consumption behavior of a process over time. It thus enables fine-grained energy-aware production scheduling. A case study is conducted for a blow molding process in a Belgian plastic bottle manufacturer. The measured power data enables to build an empirical energy model. The production scheduling is performed under real-time electricity pricing data. As a result, production loads are automatically shifted to the optimal periods. The optimal idle mode is automatically selected between production loads (powering off, idle, etc.). A schedule of joint energy cost and labor cost minimization is demonstrated to reduce 12% and 5% of total cost, compared to schedules that minimize energy and labor cost, respectively. In conclusion, although the labor wage is usually higher during periods with lower electricity price, energy and labor costs can be jointly optimized as a single objective to help factories minimize the production expenditure.

The recommended information flow model is to strengthen the foundation of the integration model. This paper proposes the methodology to achieve the goal, which is to design an information flow model for Malaysia. Initial study has been done to design the information flow model in LIS. The designed model is a preliminary step prior to achieve the bigger scale for Malaysia. Ubiquitous technology is also taken into consideration to be the strong point of the model. In conclusion, this paper shows the significance of information flow model prior achieving integration. "

Cooperative based communication has attained wide interest due to its energy efficient benefits it offers. The major factor of cooperative transmission is selection of hop devices. Many clustering based cooperative transmission is adopted by various approach. These techniques are not efficient in enhancing the lifetime of sensor network since they considered minimizing energy consumption per bit only. To address this, we present a distributed \{MAC\} (Medium Access control) and transceiver optimization technique for selective hop device selection. The proposed model minimizes energy consumption per bit and maximizes the lifetime of sensor network. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance in terms of lifetime, communication overhead and node decay rate. The outcome shows significant performance improvement over existing model. "

Globally, a number of sensors being produced for animal health management are at various stages of commercialization. Some technologies for producing an accurate health status and disease diagnosis are applicable only for humans, with few modifications or testing in animal models. Now, these innovative technologies are being considered for their future use in livestock development and welfare. Precision livestock farming techniques, which include a wide span of technologies, are being applied, along with advanced technologies like microfluidics, sound analyzers, image-detection techniques, sweat and salivary sensing, serodiagnosis, and others. However, there is a need to integrate all the available sensors and create an efficient online monitoring system so that animal health status can be monitored in real time, without delay. This review paper discusses the scope of different wearable technologies for animals, nano biosensors and advanced molecular biology diagnostic techniques for the detection of various infectious diseases of cattle, along with the efforts to enlist and compare these technologies with respect to their drawbacks and advantages in the domain of animal health management. The paper considers all recent developments in the field of biosensors and their applications for animal health to provide insight regarding the appropriate approach to be used in the future of enhanced animal welfare.

The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing. "

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one of the cultural algorithms for solving many hard problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). \{ACO\} is a natural behaviour of ants, which work stochastically with the help of pheromone trails deposited in the shortest route to find their food. This optimization procedure involves adapting, positive feedback and inherent parallelism. Each ant will deposit certain amount of pheromone in the tour construction it makes searching for food. This type of communication is known as stigmetric communication. In addition, if a dense \{WBAN\} environment prevails, such as hospital, i.e. in the environment of overlapping WBAN, game formulation was introduced for analyzing the mixed strategy behaviour of WBAN. In this paper, the ant colony optimization approach to the travelling salesman problem was applied to the \{WBAN\} to determine the shortest route for sending emergency message to the doctor via sensor nodes; and also a static Bayesian game formulation with mixed strategy was analysed to enhance the network lifetime. Whenever the patient needs any critical care or any other medical issue arises, emergency messages will be created by the \{WBAN\} and sent to the doctor's destination. All the modes of communication were realized in a simulation environment using OMNet++. The authors investigated a balanced model of emergency message dissemination and network lifetime in \{WBAN\} using \{ACO\} and Bayesian game formulation. "

However, a significant proportion of the population has either remained or become digitally excluded. This systematic literature review elucidates the factors underlying the concepts of “digital exclusion” and the “digital divide” in higher education. The identified factors are grouped into three categories: social exclusion (i.e., low income, ICT-avoidance as the norm, lack of motivation and commitment, and physical or mental disability), digital exclusion (i.e., lack of hardware devices and Internet services) and accessibility (which include the division between rural and urban areas, as well as disparities in \{ICT\} literacy and information literacy). These factors are multi-tiered and overlapping. Studies on the digital divide, digital exclusion, and barriers to \{ICT\} adoption in higher education deal with similar factors, but these are experienced differently in different contexts. While generalizing these factors into categories enables a better understanding of the nature of digital exclusion, solving and circumventing them remains complex due their dependency on the particular context of a higher education institution.

We envision a distributed execution environment comprised of diverse computing resources as an alternative solution to this problem. This execution environment can be defined as a mobile cloud. However, the inherent unreliability of the mobile cloud requires developers to add reliability within the applications separately making the development process tedious. In this position paper, we present Aegis - a framework that provides a reliable and unified computing platform with built-in failure detection and repair mechanisms. Aegis draws upon the actor based execution model as well as stream processing applications to provide a reliable overlay over unreliable environments. Aegis also relives developers of the task of adding reliability mechanisms to applications separately. "

abstract = "Abstract Service is a key context for the application of IT, as \{IT\} digitizes information interactions in service and facilitates value creation, thereby contributing to service innovation. The recent proliferation of big data provides numerous opportunities for information-intensive services (IISs), in which information interactions exert the greatest effect on value creation. In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in \{IISs\} is essential for using \{IT\} to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new \{IISs\} and by analyzing data usage in 149 \{IIS\} cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs. The main contribution of this study is to provide a simple yet comprehensive and empirically tested basis for the use and management of data to facilitate service value creation. "

In response, this paper provides a framework for systematically identifying cyber-physical vulnerabilities in manufacturing systems. The proposed approach employs intersection mapping to identify cyber-physical vulnerabilities in manufacturing. A cyber-physical vulnerability impact analysis using decision trees then provides the manufacturer with a stoplight scale between low, medium, and high levels of cyber-physical vulnerability for each analyzed production process. The stoplight scale allows manufacturers to interpret assessment results in an intuitive way. Finally, the paper provides a case study of the proposed approach at an applied manufacturing research facility and provides general recommendations to securing similar facilities from cyber-physical attacks.

With Google's “Project Ara”, a modular and customizable smartphone approach is very likely to reach market maturity and its economic, social and ecologic impacts are still unclear. Using a qualitative case study approach, we shed light on its potential economic success. Furthermore, we use the two theoretical concepts of Eco Innovation (EI) and Systemic Innovation (SI) to assess Google Ara's potential to lead to changes in terms of ecologic and social concerns. In our analysis, we show that Project Ara has the potential to outperform its competitors of modular smartphones. We work out that Google's modular approach could lead to a longer useful life of smartphones – or at least for some components. Finally, we affirm Project Ara's general potential for being an SI. Even though Project Ara will very likely not change the complete smartphone market and the behavior of the involved actors, there is a potential for influencing sociocultural behavior in the long tail of the smartphone market.

However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers’ attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers’ behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions. "

Thus, it is difficult to establish a streamlined flow in the entire process of the complex built environment system and to arrange and optimize the required resources in a timely manner. To address this challenge, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of the built environment system and to provide the decision-makers with timely and accurate information for making better decisions. For achieving this objective, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for an Intelligent Planning Unit (IPU) for the complex built environment system, which consists of three phases (i.e., \{IPU\} planning, \{IPU\} application, and \{IPU\} network). An \{IPU\} represents a well-defined planning unit that can be initiated to achieve a specific purpose (e.g., cost, schedule, materials, and process). An \{IPU\} can be defined by breaking down the physical entities and processes in the complex built environment system into carefully planned units (even nano-scale units). A well-defined \{IPU\} can be replicated and implemented at the different levels of complexity; and then, it can be improved through a refinement process using the intelligent feature of communication. This paper illustrated the \{IPU\} concept through several examples and also highlighted possible challenges and opportunities in implementing the \{IPU\} concept in the complex built environment system. This paper is designed to ensure that a project meets the client expectations on various aspects in the complex built environment system. "

First, the paper outlines a research framework for the development and evaluation of low carbon mobility solutions driven by two disruptive forces which are changing the mobility landscape and providing consumers with more choices to meet their transport needs: automated self-driving and on-demand shared mobility services. The focus of this paper is on development of rigorous models for understanding the demand for travel in the age of connected mobility, and assessing their impacts particularly under scenarios of autonomous or self-driving on-demand shared mobility. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the paper provides initial results from a pilot study on a small road network in Melbourne, Australia. A base case scenario representing the current situation of using traditional privately owned vehicles, and two autonomous mobility on-demand (AMoD) scenarios were simulated on a real transport network. In the first scenario (AMoD1), it was assumed that the on-demand vehicles were immediately available to passengers (maximum waiting times is zero). This constraint was relaxed in the second scenario (AMoD2) by increasing the allowable passenger waiting times up to a maximum of 5 minutes. The results showed that using the \{AMoD\} system resulted in a significant reduction in both the number of vehicles required to meet the transport needs of the community (reduction of 43% in AMoD1, and 88% in AMoD2), and the required on-street parking space (reduction of 58% in \{AMoD1\} and 83% in AMoD2). However, the simulation also showed that this was achieved at the expense of a less significant increase in the total \{VKT\} (increase of 29% in \{AMoD1\} and 10% in AMoD2). The paper concludes by describing how the model is being extended, the remaining challenges that need to be overcome in this research, and outlines the next steps to achieve the desired outcomes. "

Technologies aimed at fall detection, assessment, prediction and prevention are emerging, yet there has been no consistency in describing or reporting on interventions using technologies. With the growth of eHealth and data driven interventions, a common language and classification is required. Objective The \{FARSEEING\} Taxonomy of Technologies was developed as a tool for those in the field of biomedical informatics to classify and characterise components of studies and interventions. Methods The Taxonomy Development Group (TDG) comprised experts from across Europe. Through face-to-face meetings and contributions via email, five domains were developed, modified and agreed: Approach; Base; Components of outcome measures; Descriptors of technologies; and Evaluation. Each domain included sub-domains and categories with accompanying definitions. The classification system was tested against published papers and further amendments undertaken, including development of an online tool. Six papers were classified by the \{TDG\} with levels of consensus recorded. Results Testing the taxonomy with papers highlighted difficulties in definitions across international healthcare systems, together with differences of \{TDG\} members’ backgrounds. Definitions were clarified and amended accordingly, but some difficulties remained. The taxonomy and manual were large documents leading to a lengthy classification process. The development of the online application enabled a much simpler classification process, as categories and definitions appeared only when relevant. Overall consensus for the classified papers was 70.66%. Consensus scores increased as modifications were made to the taxonomy. Conclusion The \{FARSEEING\} Taxonomy of Technologies presents a common language, which should now be adopted in the field of biomedical informatics. In developing the taxonomy as an online tool, it has become possible to continue to develop and modify the classification system to incorporate new technologies and interventions. "

Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop e-machine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine pilot assembly line, is being supported by a set of virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a \{CPS\} using an e-machine assembly station as a case study. The main contribution of the work is to further validate the \{CPS\} philosophy by extending the concept into practical applications in pilot production systems with prototype products. "

In this work, a coupled-mode aero elastic fluttering system, exploiting self-sustained oscillations to harvest electrical energy from the mechanical one, is proposed. An airfoil can freely turn around its rotational axis, bounded to two elastomers parallel to the flow: in the presence of a fluid in motion, under particular mechanical conditions, the system exhibits limit cycle oscillations characterized by noteworthy amplitude and frequency. Moving in the space of parameters every flow speed range is theoretically achievable for the purposes of electrical extraction; this work will focus on low wind speed conditions. By positioning a pair of coils at the ends of the rotational axis of the wing and fixing magnets in an alternated polarity in front of their quasi-vertical harmonic motion, an electro-magnetic coupling (EMc) is obtained: during the oscillations an alternated voltage at the ends of the coils is measured. Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs), composite material formed by coupling two stretchable electrodes to a high permittivity rubber, forming a capacitor in which the capacitance changes with the stretching, replace traditional elastomers: this permits, by charging the \{DEGs\} in the maximal stretched status and discharging it in the pre-stretch status, to amplify the input voltage. \{DEGs\} cannot be an autonomous powering, because they need an external electrical energy source. Synergistically, the use of an integrated circuit designed for storing efficiently the charges from the \{EMc\} in a supercapacitor (SC), and electronics able to manage the \{DEGs\} by a ‘charge pumping’ process supplying a second SC, allows to ensure an excellent and adaptable autonomous powering. A further synergy is introduced exploiting intrinsic effects of the two electrical extraction strategies adopted in the system: \{EM\} damping due to the resistance load, and the change in stiffness of \{DEGs\} when a voltage is applied, can extend the operating speed range, increasing its global efficiency. Centimeter-sized devices exploiting \{EMc\} and DEGs, and an overview about \{DEGs\} materials are presented in this work. "

Therefore, timely providing of real-time data to the passengers is high on the list of airlines and airports. Since not every passenger has a mobile device at hand, relevant information need also be disseminated offline. Static and dynamic signs cover the above mentioned issues, but the place, where such signs are installed is crucial. The goal of our new design concept for terminals is providing information to passengers, where and when they need it. Each service point — from check-in through security check to boarding — has been designed using curved layout design and furniture along with large displays for information. The size of the displays is chosen such that passengers are able to recognize important information with respect to the specific service point at one glance. Waiting seats are surrounding the service point to provide an unhindered view to the displays and to promote communication. We implemented our design ideas in our artificial terminal building of an international airport. The impact of information displays is modeled by a microscopic simulation. Adopting the assumption that the information displays make it easier for the passengers to figure out the way through the terminal we simulate a whole day at the artificial terminal. "

We reflect on challenges and opportunities faced by a ‘boundary organisation’ that interfaces between science and policy, taking as example the European Commission’s Directorate General Joint Research Centre, whose mission is stated as that to be the “in-house science service”. We suggest that such an institution can be exemplary as to what could be changed to improve the quality of evidence feeding into the policy processes in the European Union. This paper suggests how an in-house culture of reflexivity and humility could trigger changes in the existing styles and methods of scientific governance; at the JRC, taken as example, this would mean opening up to the existing plurality of norms and styles of scientific inquiry, and adopting more participatory approaches of knowledge production, assessment and governance. We submit that the institutional changes advocated here are desirable and urgent in order to confront the ongoing erosion of trust in ‘evidence based policy’, anticipating controversies before they become evident in the institutional setting in which institutions operate.

This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘(’omic)’ approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established’omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially \{SNPs\} and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.

Thus, the question arises what mechanisms contribute to raise productivity in the current revolution “Industrie 4.0”. Whereas the initial point of all past industrial revolutions can be located in the industry, they resulted in a tremendous change in society. In the present industrial revolution it is the other way around: Reviewing the beginning of the current transformation process, it is not driven by the production industry itself. Instead one of its main drivers is the invention of social networks and smart devices in combination with the employees’ appealing to it. This development of interconnectivity pushes into the industrial sector today. For instance, there exists a desire of employees to bring their own device to work. According to a survey by Accenture 82 percent of the Chinese respondents would be “more resourceful” if they chose their own hardware and software for work. The first three revolutions had a strong focus on the shop floor. This is also true for the present industrial revolution: The public view is merely on its impact on production processes. Therefore, this paper expands this view and additionally analyses the effects of the relating transformation processes to the indirect departments. The paper first analyses the enablers which mainly contribute to Industrie 4.0. Subsequently a reference systems is deduced which consists of basic collaboration mechanisms to increase productivity in the direct and indirect departments. A wide transparency and understanding of those collaboration mechanisms empower producing companies to profit from Industrie 4.0 by deriving individual activities which lead to a growth in productivity and therefore competitiveness. The specified approaches were conducted within the framework of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology in High-Wage countries” of the \{RWTH\} Aachen University. "

In order to provide a technical foundation for seamless knowledge transfer among actors, \{VNs\} require distributed and interoperable intra- and inter-organizational knowledge management systems (KMS), which rely largely on advanced information and communication technology (ICT). \{KMS\} cannot be seen as stand-alone information systems but should address a variety of issues (e.g. organizational or social issues) in relation to knowledge management. Therefore, the new generation of such complex systems, appropriate for VNs, must deal with this variety of issues, ranging from merely business-oriented to pure technologically-oriented issues. Although scholars have studied knowledge transfer and \{ICT\} issues in \{VN\} settings, their insights and results remain fragmented because of the diverse research efforts from different perspectives (either from a more business or a more technical perspective). This necessitates that a broader perspective needs to be established. This study endeavors to address simultaneously potential issues of both knowledge transfer and \{ICT\} in a \{VN\} by developing a comprehensive integrated framework. The development of the framework is based on a three-step methodology which comprises the exploration and classification of generic \{ICT\} issues in a \{VN\} setting, and subsequently integrating knowledge transfer issues with \{ICT\} issues. The proposed integrated framework provides a well-structured theoretical basis for future \{KMS\} requirement engineering in \{VN\} environments. "

Recent efforts that study such platforms have emphasized the need for improved evaluation methods, particularly feature-focused scenario-based evaluations. Thus, the objective of this work was to perform a comparative analysis of two prominent \{AAL\} middleware platforms and their programmability for Older Adults with Dementia (OAwD) to ultimately derive guidelines for the development of \{AAL\} systems. Mapping of a platform-independence use-case scenario to both platforms, hinted towards the need for graphical-user interfaces over text-based interfaces and application area-specific modules. "

The aims of the study were to develop an ergonomics checklist for the evaluation of \{MTPCs\} and to identify key ergonomics issues in the design as well as in the usage of MTPCs. In the first step of the study we undertook an overview of the checklists developed for computer workstations and mobile computer devices that are found in the human factors literature. This overview resulted in a categorization of checklists based on their organizations, rating scales, general purposes and level of detail. In the second step of the study an interview was conducted with 29 doctors; with a wide variety of specialization; in various hospitals to explore important issues as well as problem caused by computer usage. As the result of the analysis of answers given to interview questions and analysis of other checklists based on computers and medical devices 5 key concepts were chosen as the structural elements of the ergonomics checklist that is the primary output of this study, These key concepts are mobile usage, portability, office usage, cleaning and disinfection and hardware evaluation.

The lack of interoperability hampers the integration and usage of these devices and services. Furthermore, one objective in the field of Ambient Intelligence and Human Machine Interaction is the adaption of assistive services to the user 5. This is deeply rooted in the idea that the usage of ambient technologies still means a barrier for elderly and impaired people and prevents them to trust and use these technologies. But as these technologies aim at supporting and not restricting elderly and impaired people, a methodology is needed to overcome the barrier of using ambient assistive technologies. In this paper, we present an approach to a) enable a simplified integration of heterogeneous devices and services by the Web of Things recommendation and b) a lightweight \{AAL\} ontology together with a rule-based engine called Sherlock in order to demonstrate the advantages in representing and linking user intentions to device capabilities using Semantic Web technologies. Moreover, we show how this semantic representation in the context-aware Sherlock engine is used to derive user intentions by recognising device events.

Typically, exception handling is defined locally within the scope of an intra-organizational business process, using the appropriate business process modelling language constructs. However, these constructs do not foresee exceptions that occur in cross- organizational processes. In this paper we propose a WS-BPEL extension to define an interface between cross- organizational processes, in order to monitor the state of each interacting process and, consequently, define cross- organizational exception behaviour. We also present a prototype implementation of our proposed extensions by using a model transformation approach and an open-source business process engine. "

The u-city is at a more advanced level than a smart city, and building a smart city is a step toward the u-city. Thus, this study develops an effective framework to determine the required platform toward establishing a u-city by explores the main components of a smart city, such as citizens, environments, and key infrastructures, and the criteria to measure each component. The interaction between the components and their criteria, are specified using the Analytical Network Process (ANP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods Finally, according to the weights obtained, a ubiquitous coefficient for a city is proposed. In this study, the u-coefficients for Tehran, Iran and Seoul, South Korea are obtained (45% and 92%, respectively), which verify the accuracy of the suggested framework for determining ubiquitous conditions of cities. Tehran has the highest weights in the basic components (citizens and governments) and it needs to invest in building a ubiquitous infrastructure in transportation, healthcare, and the economy. "

A well designed and efficiently developed Product-Service System (PSS) is a solid alternative to achieve this goal. The \{PSS\} design should search for new ways to add value for both company and customers. The \{PSS\} design model may help the company to innovate, strengthen competitiveness and assure the desired profit. In this paper we propose a methodology that integrates Design Thinking (DT) and Business Analytics (BA) in the \{PSS\} design in a way to build a profitable and lasting PSS. Design Thinking is a human-centered and systematic approach to problem solving and is used in the model to deeply understand customer needs and satisfy their emotional requirements considering company's resources and constraints. \{BA\} is the capacity to aggregate, to analyze and to use data in a way to optimize the business results. The large quantity of information available from sensors, logs and other machine sources, associated with information and communication technologies (ICT) advances allow companies to collect and analyze a large quantity of data. Through the data analysis, companies may evaluate consumer behavior, sense changes in the market quickly and identify new opportunities to innovate. Furthermore, companies may use the data as a third layer to add value besides the product and service layers. The proposed model addresses a lack in the literature of \{PSS\} design and adds relevant information for companies designing or reconfiguring a PSS. "

The increasing connectedness has made communities more vulnerable for their dependence on a complex network of critical infrastructures.

While the pathway to more resilience is promising and has many advocates, the response to crises and disasters, time and again reveals the challenges related to (i) ad-hoc switching from preparedness to response; (ii) ad-hoc connecting professional responders, communities, volunteers, and local authorities; and (iii) designing systems and tools that are tailored such that the feedback from local communities can be taken into account for coordination and planning. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed in designing crisis and disaster management information systems linking ad-hoc response to longer-term planning, in which networks of communities are at the core of the process.

abstract = "Abstract Community Operational Research (Community OR), and its disciplinary relation, Community-Based Operations Research, has an increasingly high profile within multiple domains that benefit from empirical and analytical approaches to problem solving. These domains are primarily concentrated within nonprofit services and local development. However, there are many other disciplines and application areas for which novel applications and extensions of Community \{OR\} could generate valuable insights. This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between ‘emerging trends’ (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and ‘new frontiers’, which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions. This paper will show how the exploration of emerging trends and new frontiers in Community \{OR\} can provide a basis for the development of innovative research agendas that can broaden the scope and impact of the decision sciences.

The most viable option of implementing \{M2M\} communication is over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. A key challenge for \{M2M\} communication over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the performance of Random Access Channel (RACH) because its operation was not designed with the enormous number of \{M2M\} devices in mind. To deal with the situation reduces network access success rate, several major access control methods were adopted. However, the suggested methods generally increase the access success rate regardless of delay requirements. On the other hand, access delay is crucial for many \{M2M\} applications such as healthcare. This paper investigates the effects of \{LTE\} Random Access Methods on healthcare \{M2M\} applications when enormous number of devices are introduced. The study clearly shows that to meet the requirements for delay sensitive \{M2M\} applications, the random access (RA) resources should be very strictly and carefully allocated. "

However, in healthcare, such practices, beyond elicitation, are immature. The introduction of changes to existing healthcare processes or e-systems often fails because users’ needs and operational/organizational goals may not get satisfied. In addition, healthcare is moving toward a value-based paradigm that requires a comprehensive evaluation and re-engineering of current processes, which puts more pressure on healthcare professionals to apply advanced \{RE\} techniques, such as goal and process modeling, in order to obtain much desired results effectively. In this paper, we discuss the integration of new technology-depending processes, e.g., that come with off-the-shelf solutions, with existing healthcare processes. We propose the use of an Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) framework to investigate the impact of each potential integration on the organizational goals and user satisfaction. Performance indicators are used to reason about measurable quantities beyond goal satisfaction. The paper implements the AbPI approach with the User Requirement Notation standard and illustrates its feasibility with a real example related to wait time indication in an emergency room.

In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of \{IURVs\} with different forms. Five case studies are presented of \{IURVs\} in the countries with the largest number of \{IURVs\} involving \{US\} universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of \{IURVs\} depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the \{IURV\} in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved. "

We propose a proactive event-driven decision model for joint predictive maintenance and spare parts inventory optimization which addresses the Decide phase of the “Detect- Predict- Decide- Act” model and can be embedded to an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) for real-time processing in the frame of e-maintenance concept.

The cooperation between the Software Defined Network (SDN) and the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) seems to be a promising technology paradigm. The bottleneck of current SDN/NFV implementations is the use of a centralized controller. In this paper, different scenarios to identify the pro and cons of a distributed control-plane were investigated. We implemented a prototypal framework to benchmark different centralized and distributed approaches. The test results have been critically analyzed and related considerations and recommendations have been reported. The outcome of our research influenced the control plane design of the following European R&amp;D projects: PLATINO, FI-WARE and T-NOVA. "

This interface is potentiated by a BIM-based interface presenting real-time data of the building. The solution, called 3i buildings - Intelligent, Interactive, and Immersive Buildings, is a tool to monitor and manage smart buildings, as well as optimize users experience, energy consumptions and environment quality. This is achieved by a grid of sensors and devices that continuously gather information (structural conditions of the building, occupancy, comfort of occupants, energy consumptions and CO2, COV's and Humidity levels, etc.), which is processed by predictive models able to learn over time. The 3D representation of the models allows managers to take advantage of the virtual environment, by augmenting the facility model and including information about the facility, making it easier and perceptible to users and owners, helping them to make better decisions. To support our research, the system will be installed in three different environments, Luz's hospital, Lisbon Aquarium and Norte Shopping, to test the solution under different conditions, objectives and users. In the first two cases the objectives are to monitor building air quality, consumptions and occupancy and in the Norte Shopping case the objectives are to monitor people flows, interact with tem and help the response in case of crisis according to the adopted emergency plan. These types of systems might help reducing energy consumptions as well as increasing comfort and satisfaction of occupants, maintaining a constant concentration of \{CO2\} and humidity within the facility. The optimized algorithms will allow the system to learn, predicting and reacting to different conditions, giving a more reliable and smooth response to occupants needs. "

The proposed novel concept envisions an integrated platform of providing a strong linkage between different stakeholders such as street lighting networks, landline telephone networks and future wireless networks, and is universal in nature being independent of the operating frequency bands and traffic types. The main motivating factors for the proposed small cell concept are the need of public infrastructure re-engineering, and the recent advances in several enabling technologies. First, we highlight the main concepts of the proposed UnISCell platform. Subsequently, we present two deployment scenarios for the proposed UnISCell concept considering infrastructure sharing and service sharing as important aspects. We then describe the key future technologies for enabling the proposed UnISCell concept and present a use case example with the help of numerical results.

Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics. "

In this context, the efficient processing of the big amounts of information, also known as Big Data forms a major challenge for both the research community and a wide variety of industrial sectors, involving security, health and financial applications. Serving these emerging needs, the current paper presents a Graph Analytics based Platform (GAP) that implements a top-down approach for the facilitation of Data Mining processes through the incorporation of state-of-the-art techniques, like behavioural clustering, interactive visualizations, multi-objective optimization, etc. The applicability of this platform is validated on 2 istinct real-world use cases, which can be considered as characteristic examples of modern Big Data problems, due to the vast amount of information they deal with. In particular, (i) the root cause analysis of a Denial of Service attack in the network of a mobile operator and (ii) the early detection of an emerging event or a hot topic in social media communities. In order to address the large volume of the data, the proposed application starts with an aggregated overview of the whole network and allows the operator to gradually focus on smaller sets of data, using different levels of abstraction. The proposed platform offers differentiation between different user behaviors that enable the analyst to obtain insight on the network’s operation and to extract the meaningful information in an effortless manner. Dynamic hypothesis formulation techniques exploited by graph traversing and pattern mining, enable the analyst to set concrete network-related hypotheses, and validate or reject them accordingly. "

Combined with the presence of pervasive coastal threats, such as flooding and erosion, this is having widespread impacts on coastal populations, infrastructure and ecosystems. For the right adaptive strategies to be adopted, and planning decisions to be made, rigorous evaluation of the available options is required. This evaluation hinges on the availability and use of suitable datasets. For knowledge to be derived from coastal datasets, such data needs to be combined and analysed in an effective manner. This paper reviews a wide range of literature relating to data-driven approaches to coastal risk evaluation, revealing how limitations have been imposed on many of these methods, due to restrictions in computing power and access to data. The rapidly emerging field of ‘Big Data’ can help overcome many of these hurdles. ‘Big Data’ involves powerful computer infrastructures, enabling storage, processing and real-time analysis of large volumes and varieties of data, in a fast and reliable manner. Through consideration of examples of how ‘Big Data’ technologies are being applied to fields related to coastal risk, it becomes apparent that geospatial Big Data solutions hold clear potential to improve the process of risk based decision making on the coast. ‘Big Data’ does not provide a stand-alone solution to the issues and gaps outlined in this paper, yet these technological methods hold the potential to optimise data-driven approaches, enabling robust risk profiles to be generated for coastal regions.

Requirement analysis is a key software engineering task in the whole lifecycle of applications; however, the requirements for monitoring systems within edge computing scenarios are not yet fully established. The goal of the present survey study is therefore threefold: to identify the main challenges in the field of monitoring edge computing applications that are as yet not fully solved; to present a new taxonomy of monitoring requirements for adaptive applications orchestrated upon edge computing frameworks; and to discuss and compare the use of widely-used cloud monitoring technologies to assure the performance of these applications. Our analysis shows that none of existing widely-used cloud monitoring tools yet provides an integrated monitoring solution within edge computing frameworks.

This work focuses on the application of location intelligence to simplify the modeling of data networks’ activity in such complex systems. It is essential to describe and understand when and where data is generated to effectively design, plan and manage communication networks. We introduce a model based on traffic generation rules and patterns to be applied over Geographic Information Systems data to create “dynamic data activity heat maps”.

However, current enterprise systems lack a significant involvement of the human aspects. An innovation model can incorporate those three components to provide greater value to stakeholders, drive organizational growth, gain a competitive advantage and achieve greater end-user satisfaction. We investigated how an enterprise systems model for open innovation could be created based on existing innovation socio-technical frameworks and how that model may benefit the \{UK\} National Health Service (NHS). We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the \{NHS\} is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments.

Informatics is a key to the design of services in manufacturing companies. Informatics facilitates the collection of various types of data from products and customers and enables the production and delivery of useful information for customers. This paper (1) proposes a conceptual framework for designing informatics-based services in manufacturing industries, (2) introduces a service design case study that the authors recently conducted with a major car manufacturer in Korea, and (3) suggests future research issues.

Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 30 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the recordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difficult to make in the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier. "

We will show that it is a very cost-effective way to build refuges, and viable solutions exist for various budgets and timeframes. Nuclear submarines are surface independent, and could provide energy, oxygen, fresh water and perhaps even food for their inhabitants for years. They are able to withstand close nuclear explosions and radiation. They are able to maintain isolation from biological attacks and most known weapons. They already exist and need only small adaptation to be used as refuges.

Although functional safety and cyber-security engineering have a considerable overlap, the trend of adapting methods from one domain to the other is often challenged by non-domain experts. Just as safety became a critical part of the development in the late 20th century, modern vehicles are now required to become resilient against cyber-attacks. As vehicle providers gear up for this challenge, they can capitalize on experiences from many other domains, but must also face several unique challenges. Such as, that cyber-security engineering will now join reliability and safety as a cornerstone for success in the automotive industry and approaches need to be integrated into the mainly safety oriented development lifecycle of the domain. The recently released \{SAE\} \{J3061\} guidebook for cyber-physical vehicle systems focus on designing cyber-security aware systems in close relation to the automotive safety standard \{ISO\} 26262. The key contribution of this paper is to analyse a method to identify attack vectors on complex automotive systems via signal interfaces and propose a security classification scheme and protection mechanisms on signal layer. To that aim, the hardware- software interface (HSI), a central development artefact of the \{ISO\} 26262 functional safety development process, is used and extended to support the cyber-security engineering process and provide cyber-security countermeasures on signal layer.

The importance of this study lies in investigating the effects of using \{SNs\} in collaborative learning on learners, whether undergraduate or postgraduate, from many different aspects such as performance, interaction, socialization, collaboration, and decision making. Based on the results of this study, several decisions can be made such as applying blended learning or making better use of \{SNs\} in the field of teaching. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to achieve the research aim. The study is exploratory in nature and data was obtained from 300 Egyptian university students via structured questionnaire. Regression analysis and Mann Whitney U tests were performed to analyze the gathered data. The results support all hypotheses, except for the relationship between intention towards \{SNs\} and actual use in collaborative learning among undergraduate students. Further, no significant differences were found between undergraduate and postgraduate students with respect to all the proposed model constructs. The current study adds to the extent of literature in two respective ways. Firstly, testing and validating \{TAM\} in a developing culture; and secondly, although \{TAM\} has been extensively applied in evaluating the adoption of different technologies, few studies have exploited it on the adoption of SNs.

Qualitative data were collected with an organisational perspective from commercial food consumers along with large-scale food importers, distributors, and retailers. Cause-effect models are built and “what-if” simulations are conducted through the development and application of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approaches to elucidate dynamic interrelationships. The simulation models developed provide a practical insight into existing and emergent food losses scenarios, suggesting the need for big data sets to allow for generalizable findings to be extrapolated from a more detailed quantitative exercise. This research offers itself as evidence to support policy makers in the development of policies that facilitate interventions to reduce food losses. It also contributes to the literature through sustaining, impacting and potentially improving levels of food security, underpinned by empirically constructed policy models that identify potential behavioural changes. It is the extension of these simulation models set against a backdrop of a proposed big data framework for food security, where this study sets avenues for future research for others to design and construct big data research in food supply chains. This research has therefore sought to provide policymakers with a means to evaluate new and existing policies, whilst also offering a practical basis through which food chains can be made more resilient through the consideration of management practices and policy decisions.

This study looks into such personalized services that reflect different characteristics of a diverse range of residents who have different behavior patterns. Such services can increase the satisfaction of the residents by providing flexible services that take into account the lifestyle and circumstances of each resident. A problem with offering customized services, however, is that there is a dearth of data on individuals. Sufficient amount of data must be collected in order to determine what a proper service for an individual is. As such, this study explains the life-log data and discusses its collection method. The life-log data collected serves as crucial grounds for decision-making. How decisions are made using the life log data is an intriguing research topic. This study proposes and discusses logics and processes of various decision-making methods that can be executed using the life log-data. In their homes, residents tend to regularly display certain behaviors in patterns, which allows for identifying the residents’ behavior patterns, as well as the predicting the residents’ future behavior.

abstract = "Abstract Urban microclimate studies are gaining popularity due to rapid urbanization. Many studies documented that urban microclimate can affect building energy performance, human morbidity and mortality and thermal comfort. Historically, urban microclimate studies were conducted with observational methods such as field measurements. In the last decades, with the advances in computational resources, numerical simulation approaches have become increasingly popular. Nowadays, especially simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is frequently used to assess urban microclimate. \{CFD\} can resolve the transfer of heat and mass and their interaction with individual obstacles such as buildings. Considering the rapid increase in \{CFD\} studies of urban microclimate, this paper provides a review of research reported in journal publications on this topic till the end of 2015. The studies are categorized based on the following characteristics: morphology of the urban area (generic versus real) and methodology (with or without validation study). In addition, the studies are categorized by specifying the considered urban settings/locations, simulation equations and models, target parameters and keywords. This review documents the increasing popularity of the research area over the years. Based on the data obtained concerning the urban location, target parameters and keywords, the historical development of the studies is discussed and future perspectives are provided. According to the results, early \{CFD\} microclimate studies were conducted for model development and later studies considered \{CFD\} approach as a predictive methodology. Later, with the established simulation setups, research efforts shifted to case studies. Recently, an increasing amount of studies focus on urban scale adaptation measures. The review hints a possible change in this trend as the results from \{CFD\} simulations can be linked up with different aspects (e.g. economy) and with different scales (e.g. buildings), and thus, \{CFD\} can play an important role in transferring urban climate knowledge into engineering and design practice.

Due to the complexity of bucket-environment interactions, even three decades of research efforts towards automation of the bucket loading operation have not yet resulted in any fully autonomous system. This paper highlights the key challenges in automation and tele-remote operation of earth-moving machines and provides a survey of different areas of research within the scope of the earth-moving operation. The survey of publications presented in this paper is conducted with an aim to highlight the previous and ongoing research work in this field with an effort to strike a balance between recent and older publications. Another goal of the survey is to identify the research areas in which knowledge essential to automate the earth moving process is lagging behind.

To prepare for the future, a smart grid with intelligent periphery, or smart GRIP, is proposed. The building blocks of \{GRIP\} architecture are called clusters and include an energy-management system (EMS)-controlled transmission grid in the core and distribution grids, micro-grids, and smart buildings and homes on the periphery; all of which are hierarchically structured. The layered architecture of \{GRIP\} allows a seamless transition from the present to the future and plug-and-play interoperability. The basic functions of a cluster consist of ① dispatch, ② smoothing, and ③ mitigation. A risk-limiting dispatch methodology is presented; a new device, called the electric spring, is developed for smoothing out fluctuations in periphery clusters; and means to mitigate failures are discussed.

Current measures to reduce the emissions primarily focus on eco-efficiency, seeking mainly for minimized energy demand and to a smaller extent also for minimized resource consumption. However, this strategy of just “making things less bad” will not suffice to overcome the aforementioned challenges. Instead eco-effectiveness strategies need to be aspired, containing manufacturing systems which lead to a positive recoupling between economy and ecology. Contemporary trends and solutions in industry prove that the metamorphosis towards eco-effectiveness has already started and is gaining momentum. This contribution gives an overview about historically related bad impacts of manufacturing to environment and society and derives requirements for future manufacturing, leading to the concept of a Positive Impact Factory. Several industry examples are presented, showing factories on their individual way towards such positive impacts. "

To this end a survey has been designed using a quali-quantitative method (web-questionnaire and focus groups) to investigate the needs of the tourist and transport operators. The sample included all the main actors in the transport and tourism field active in the territory of the five pilot regions: Piemonte (Italy), Rhone Alpes-Paca (France), Lake Constance and Lake Chiemsee (Germany), Gorizia (Italy) and Nova Gorica (Slovenia). The research has showed that there is not a single solution to define a unique business model for the tools developed by AlpInfoNet and has, likewise, developed specific actions and approaches according to the target users.

A critical reason for such bad recommendations lies in the intrinsic assumption that recommended users and items are independent and identically distributed (IID) in existing theories and systems. Another phenomenon is that, while tremendous efforts have been made to model specific aspects of users or items, the overall user and item characteristics and their non-IIDness have been overlooked. In this paper, the non-IID nature and characteristics of recommendation are discussed, followed by the non-IID theoretical framework in order to build a deep and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic nature of recommendation problems, from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. This non-IID recommendation research triggers the paradigm shift from \{IID\} to non-IID recommendation research and can hopefully deliver informed, relevant, personalized, and actionable recommendations. It creates exciting new directions and fundamental solutions to address various complexities including cold-start, sparse data-based, cross-domain, group-based, and shilling attack-related issues. "

abstract = "Abstract In many areas, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has made the decisive steps from prototyping to true manufacturing technology. \{AM\} processes excel based on aspects like outstanding geometrical flexibility and lack of tooling, which allows significant lead time reductions both in initial product design and in case of design adaptations. However, in production today, most of these advantages are realized based on homogeneous materials. Attempts at advancing the state of the art address the topic of material combinations and functionally graded materials. The challenges faced by such approaches differ in their level of severity, and are influenced in this respect by the actual \{AM\} process chosen. Beyond composites with spatially varying properties, the next level of complexity is the integration of geometrically defined 3D structures within the volume of a part, and specifically functional structures at that. Endeavours of the latter kind are currently receiving increased attention under headlines like “Structural Electronics” or “3D Electronics Printing”. Here, the surface or volume integrated structure typically is a sensor or electronic system. Beyond this system, the \{AM\} process then either provides a complex 3D substrate and thus addresses the packaging issue and/or replaces a conventional PCB, or it generates an engineering component directly and closely integrates it with electronic and sensor systems. So far, the backbone of most solutions realized have been hybrid production systems that integrate different manufacturing processes in a single piece of equipment. The present work provides a brief introduction to the various \{AM\} techniques and discusses a disambiguation based on their general capability of producing functional structures on a volume integration level. A classification of such structures is suggested that accounts for their level of complexity in relation to the typical, layer-wise manufacturing scheme adopted in AM. Examples stemming from a global research landscape are discussed in the context of this classification. In this, two special foci are selected reflecting related activities at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials (Fraunhofer IFAM): One of these is a combination of manufacturing processes, with functional printing and other direct write techniques linked to \{AM\} processes in a dedicated manufacturing cell. The other addresses integration of pre-fabricated electronic components like \{RFID\} systems into metal components produced by means of selective laser melting (SLM).The study closes with an overview of future research trends towards producing components with integrated electronics. In doing so, special emphasis is given to \{AM\} techniques that allow for in-process switching of materials and thus have the potential of realizing complex systems not by combination of processes, but within the boundaries of a single process. Also addressed are potential application scenarios that profit specifically from the combination of \{AM\} and sensor integration. "
