abstract="Recently, Internet of things (IoT) and Web of Things (WoT) lead us to the excellent era of connected everything device. However, the devices hardly show the property of the autonomous connectivity and the self-cooperation for applying in real-world environments. The purpose of this paper was to propose the adaptive IoT and WoT convergence platform that enables things to dynamically implement the smart Web without any controls from users. The adaptive IoT and WoT convergence platform, proposed in this paper, is a new type of platform which provides global inter-compatibility to help users to easily communicate with things by connecting through the webs. Through mashup of the things connected to the Web, coarsely or finely, this proposal can guarantee an efficient IoT or WoT platform management, adaptive synchronization between the things, a stable platform environment, and creating new services. The performance of our proposed platform is tested via experiments which verify that its simulations are satisfactory.",

journal="The Journal of Supercomputing",

month="Oct",
day="30",
abstract="As health data are very sensitive, there is a need to prevent and control the health data with end-to-end security solutions. In general, a number of authentication and authorization schemes are available to prevent and protect the sensitive data, which are collected with the help of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The transport layer security (TLS) protocol is designed to transfer the data from source to destination in more reliable manner. This protocol enables a user to overcome the no lost or reordered messages. The more challenge with TLS is to tolerate unreliability. In order to overcome this issue, Datagram transport layer security (DTLS) protocol has been designed and used in low-power wireless constrained networks. The DTLS protocol consists of a base protocol, record layer, handshake protocol, ChangeCipherSpec and alert protocol. The complex issue with the DTLS protocol is the possibility of an attacker could send a number of ClientHello messages to a server. This scenario would cause a denial-of-service (DOS) attack against the server. This DoS attack enables new connection between the attacker and server, increasing attacker bandwidth, and allocation of resources for every ClientHello message. In order to overcome this issue, we have proposed a smart gateway-based authentication and authorization method to prevent and protect more sensitive physiological data from an attacker and malicious users. The enhanced smart gateway-based DTLS is demonstrated with the help of Contiki Network Simulator. The packet loss ratio is calculated for the CoAP, host identity protocol, CoAP-DTLS and CoAP-enhanced DTLS to evaluate the performance of the proposed work. Data transmission and handshake time are also calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the enhanced DTLS.",

EDUCERE objectives are to investigate, develop, and evaluate innovative solutions for society to detect changes in psychomotor development through the natural interaction of children with toys and everyday objects, and perform stimulation and early attention activities in real environments such as home and school. In the EDUCERE project, an ethical impact assessment is carried out linked to a minors' data protection rights. Using a specific methodology, the project has achieved some promising results. These include use of a prototype of smart toys to detect development difficulties in children. In addition, privacy protection measures which take into account the security concerns of health data, have been proposed and applied. This latter security framework could be useful in other Internet of Things related projects. It consists of legal and technical measures. Special attention has been placed in the transformation of bulk data such as acceleration and jitter of toys into health data when patterns of atypical development are found. The article describes the different security profiles in which users are classified.",

abstract="Diabetes therapy management in AAL environments, such as old people and diabetes patients homes, is a very difficult task since many factors affect a patient's blood sugar levels. Factors such as illness, treatments, physical and psychological stress, physical activity, drugs, intravenous fluids and change in the meal plan cause unpredictable and potentially dangerous fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Right now, operations related to dosage are based on insulin infusion protocol boards, which are provided by physicians to the patients. These boards are not considering very influential factors such as glycemic index from the diet, consequently patients need to estimate the dosage leading to dose error, which culminates in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia episode. Therefore, right insulin infusion calculation needs to be supported by the next generation of personal-care devices. For this reason, a personal device has been developed to assist and consider more factors in the insulin therapy dosage calculation. The proposed solution is based on Internet of things in order to, on the one hand, support a patient's profile management architecture based on personal RFID cards and, on the other hand, provide global connectivity between the developed patient's personal device based on 6LoWPAN, nurses/physicians desktop application to manage personal health cards, glycemic index information system, and patient's web portal. This solution has been evaluated by a multidisciplinary group formed by patients, physicians, and nurses.",

Subsequently, massive multi-type of medical data which contain all kinds of user identity data, various types of vital signs data and other sensitive information are generated. Such a large scale of data in the transmission, storage and access process is facing the risk of data leakage. To effectively protect the privacy information of patients, an infrastructure framework for privacy protection of community medical Internet of things is proposed. It includes transmission protection based on multi-path asymmetric encryption fragment transmission mechanism, storage protection using distributed symmetric encryption cloud storage scheme and access control with identity authentication and dynamic access authorization. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, it is proved that the community medical data can be effectively protected.",

The architecture introduces the use of the Smart Object framework to encapsulate radio-frequency identification (RFID), sensor technologies, embedded object logic, object ad-hoc networking, and Internet-based information infrastructure. We evaluate the architecture against a number of energy-based performance measures, and also show that it outperforms existing industry standards in metrics such as network throughput, delivery ratio, or routing distance. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the architecture by detailing an implementation using Wireless Sensor Networks and Web Services, and describe a prototype for the real-time monitoring of goods flowing through a supply chain.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) enables producers of context data like sensors to interact with remote consumers of context data like smart pervasive applications in an entirely decoupled way. However, two important issues are faced by context data distribution, namely providing context information with a sufficient level of quality---i.e. quality of context (QoC)---while preserving the privacy of context owners. This article presents the solutions provided by the INCOME middleware framework for addressing these two potentially contradictory issues while hiding the complexity of context data distribution in heterogeneous and large-scale environments. Context producers and consumers not only express their needs in context contracts but also the guarantees they are ready to fulfil. These contracts are then translated into advertisement and subscription filters to determine how to distribute context data. Our experiments on a first open source prototype show that QoC-based filtering and privacy protection using attributed-based access control can be performed at a reasonable cost.",

abstract="Children's interaction with technology is evolving; increasingly there are devices that can capture and respond seamlessly to their everyday activity. This raises pertinent questions such as: how these technologies shape children's activity; how the data from their activity is used, and to what extent children, and their parents, are cognisant of the technology. This paper examines these questions in light of an emerging technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), by drawing upon three investigations (deskbased, home context, school context) into two commercially successful IoT designs (Skylanders and Disney Infinity). Whilst these particular games are limited in what activity they capture, the research illustrates how the digitalisation of everyday objects (toys) can influence both attitudes and behaviour, and generate potentially revealing data about children's everyday activity; yet with little reflection from parents or children. Encouragingly, the research also showed children's potential, with support, not just to understand, but design with this technology.",

Existing support is limited due to simplified information models reflecting narrow application scenarios and poorly scaling architectures. In response to this, we present an application architecture for pervasive internet-of-things applications which circumvents these limitations. Our architecture enables applications to utilize information from sensors and wireless sensor networks via a peer-to-peer overlay. The overlay shares sensor information in an generic information model, which is extensible and thus enables intelligent application behavior. Our evaluation of the architecture indicates that it supports the sharing of sensor information on a global scale in sensor-assisted applications, with low response times. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of running such applications in end devices with limited resources in a sensor-assisted application prototype.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the greatest technology revolutions in the history. Due to IoT potential, daily objects will be consciously worked in harmony with optimized performances. However, today, technology is not ready to fully bring its power to our daily life because of huge data analysis requirements in instant time. On the other hand, the powerful data management of cloud computing gives IoT an opportunity to make the revolution in our life. However, the traditional cloud computing server schedulers are not ready to provide services to IoT because IoT consists of a number of heterogeneous devices and applications which are far away from standardization. Therefore, to meet the expectations of users, the traditional cloud computing server schedulers should be improved to efficiently schedule and allocate IoT requests. There are several proposed scheduling algorithms for cloud computing in the literature. However, these scheduling algorithms are limited because of considering neither heterogeneous servers nor dynamic scheduling approach for different priority requests. Our objective is to propose dynamic dedicated server scheduling for heterogeneous and homogeneous systems to efficiently provide desired services by considering priorities of requests. Results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm improves throughput up to 40 {\%} in heterogeneous and homogeneous cloud computing systems for IoT requests. Our proposed scheduling algorithm and related analysis will help cloud service providers build efficient server schedulers which are adaptable to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments by considering system performance metrics, such as drop rate, throughput, and utilization in IoT.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) and its relevant technologies have been attracting the attention of researchers from academia, industry, and government in recent years. However, since the requirements of the IoT are quite different from what the Internet today can offer, several innovative techniques have been gradually developed and incorporated into IoT, which is referred to as the Future Internet of Things (FIoT). Among them, how to extract ``data'' and transfer them into ``knowledge'' from sensing layer to application layer has become a vital issue. This paper begins with an overview of IoT and FIoT, followed by discussions on how to apply data mining and computational intelligence to FIoT. An intelligent data management framework inspired by swarm optimization will then given. Finally, open issues and future trends of this field will be addressed.",

abstract="In recent years, smart technologies and networking solutions, such as Internet of things (IoT), have been adopted by most leading cities in China as ways to revitalize economic opportunities and strengthen their global resilience to climate change. This paper presents the concept of the smart city, which serves as a complex system by integrating sensors, data, applications, and organizational forms to make cities more agile and sustainable when faced with global climate changes. The paper provides a comprehensive assessment of smart city initiatives in China in recent years. Six key conceptual dimensions of smart city practices are classified: energy, agriculture, transport, buildings, urban services, and urban security operations. Chinese smart city policy and practices explore renewable energy and resources, increase public convenience, and make cities more comfortable and citizen friendly. Critical concerns are explored in such areas as integration (within the urban system, with other cities), governance, innovation, and finance. Finally, a policy vision is outlined to build up public-private collaborative networks, to encourage more innovations and investments in smart city initiatives, and to put more emphasis on smart services.",

Secondly, there are huge quantities and numerous types of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart factories, warehouses and offices. The enormous extents of data exchange and communication, management, monitoring and control of IoT devices as well as the establishment and maintenance of a reliable cloud platform hinder industrialists to implement an integrated smart production management.

In response to these challenges we present a general approach which focuses on four layers where we provide a proposed solution to each layer. We have realized the general model into a proof-of-concept implementation running on devices with limited resources, where we can moderate the information exchange based on relevance and sought after quality-of-experience by the applications.

We make the case that information obtained by auditing the flows of data can assist in demonstrating that the systems handling personal data satisfy regulatory and user requirements. Thus, components handling personal data should be audited to demonstrate that their actions comply with all such policies and requirements. A valuable side-effect of this approach is that such an auditing process will highlight areas where technical enforcement has been incompletely or incorrectly specified. There is a clear role for technical assistance in aligning privacy policy enforcement mechanisms with data protection regulations. The first step necessary in producing technology to accomplish this alignment is to gather evidence of data flows.

abstract="New services and applications become part of our daily activities as we evolve into new solutions supported by cutting-edge paradigms, like the Internet of Things and Smart Cities. In order to properly achieve the benefits theoretically provided by these models, new kinds of services must be designed. These new services have special requirements, as well as the users that access to them. One of these requirements is low latency levels, since a delayed reply could render to chaos for applications such as eHealth and public safety. The communication infrastructure must cope with these challenges by offering innovative solutions. One of these solutions is a smart service placement system that facilitates the location of services in the proper position according to specific needs. On this paper, a service placement architecture for the Internet of Things is proposed, with especial emphasis in its main module, the Service Orchestrator, for which implementation details are provided, including a model for the service placement task. Furthermore, technologies to implement the modules from the architecture are suggested. This proposal, as well as its validation, is framed within the scope of the SusCity project.",

volume="93",

abstract="Creating Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions that can be deployed at scale requires adequate experimentation environments. In the area of experimentation, two trends can be observed. First, there is a shift from lab-based, controlled experiments to experimenting ``in the wild'': researchers tend to augment the users' natural environments and observe how people integrate a new solution into their everyday lives. Second, when a substantial investment in setting up an experimentation infrastructure has been made, it makes sense to open it to a wide community of researchers; the concept of Experimentation-as-a-Service (EaaS) is emerging along these lines. SmartCampus, an IoT testbed developed at the University of Surrey, fits the both trends very well. It involves real users in a natural setting, as IoT devices are deployed in the users' offices. Further, several user-centric experiments conducted in the SmartCampus were driven by external researchers, i.e., people who do not belong to the team that developed the testbed. In this paper we report on lessons learned from such IoT experiments. After a brief overview of SmartCampus and the experiments themselves, we offer a simple experiment stakeholder model, which identifies key actors and interfaces between them. We then focus on issues related to the external experimenters who take advantage of the experimentation ``service.'' That focus is motivated by our realization that EaaS, while attractive in principle, gives rise to a number of non-trivial challenges.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a comprehensive environment that consists of a large number of sensors and mediators interconnecting heterogeneous physical objects to the Internet. IoT applications are prominent in many areas such as smart city, smart workplace, smart plants, smart agriculture and various ubiquitous computing areas. The research roadmap of IoT spans across vast domains such as mobile computing, wireless and sensor networks, service oriented computing, middleware, cloud computing and big data analytics, taking advantage of several recent breakthroughs in the respective domains. Primarily, the challenges associated with realization of IoT scenarios can be summarized across three layers: sensing and smart devices layer, connectivity layer and cloud layer. The first layer deals with the physical objects, including energy-efficient communication of the devices and developing the associated standards so that the interaction among the devices is seamless. The connectivity layer deals with the sensor data acquisition and provisioning, through gateways and sinks. The top cloud layer deals with resource provisioning for storage and processing of the acquired data, in extracting domain specific information. The participation of smart phones both as sensors and the gateways, brings in the scope for mobile web services and mobile cloud services, into this cloud based IoT architecture. The paper takes the cross-layered approach and tries to address the primary challenges of IoT through mobile web and cloud services. The paper also discusses the state of the art of each of the respective research domains along with scope for extensions and recent trends.",

abstract="The future Internet is expected to connect billions of people, things and services having the potential to deliver a new set of applications by deriving new insights from the data generated from these diverse data sources. This highly interconnected global network brings new types of challenges in analysing and making sense of data. This is why machine learning is expected to be a crucial technology in the future, in making sense of data, in improving business and decision making, and in doing so, providing the potential to solve a wide range of problems in health care, telecommunications, urban computing, and others. Machine learning algorithms can learn how to perform certain tasks by generalizing examples from a range of sampling. This is a totally different paradigm than traditional programming language approaches, which are based on writing programs that process data to produce an output. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a particular application requires a substantial amount of time and effort that is hard to undertake even with excellent research papers and textbooks. In order to reduce the time and effort, this paper introduces the TCDC (train, compare, decide, and change) approach, which can be thought as a `Machine Learning as a Service' approach, to aid machine learning researchers and practitioners to choose the optimum machine learning model to use for achieving the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, computational complexity, and ease of implementation. The paper includes the results of testing and evaluating the recommenders based on the TCDC approach (in comparison with the traditional default approach) applied to 12 datasets that are available as open-source datasets drawn from diverse domains including health care, agriculture, aerodynamics and others. Our results indicate that the proposed approach selects the best model in terms of predictive accuracy in 62.5 {\%} for regression tests performed and 75 {\%} for classification tests.",

Internet of things needs to offer efficient support for global communications and access to services and information. It needs to enable homogeneous and seamless machine-to-machine communication for different solutions and applications. This work presents an homogeneous and suitable mechanism for global resource discovery, device access for deployed smart objects in different scenarios, and sensors and devices from end users (participative sensing). The integration of legacy and sensors already available from smart buildings and smart objects is presented. For this purpose, a resolution infrastructure called ``digcovery'' is defined for maximizing efficiency and sustainability of deployments. Digcovery architecture offers the framework to allow users to register/include their own sensors into a common infrastructure and access/discover the available resources through mobile digcovery. Mobile digcovery exploits the context-awareness, geo-location, and identification technologies available in mobile platforms such as smartphones to discover, interact, and access the resources through its ElasticSearch engine.",

With the arrival of the paradigms of smart cities and the Internet of Things, citizens are able to improve their quality of life. Given that sensors and actuators deployed in smart cities usually have limited resources, today, it is a common practice to use cloud computing to extend the scope and benefits of smart cities. Taking into consideration that communication between applications and devices is vital for a good performance of services in a smart city, it is necessary to design new architectures and mechanisms to provide reliability in communications. A key aspect that has to be addressed by the new communications approaches is the possibility to recover the network and its services in case of faults, without human intervention.

The Internet of Things (IOT) integrates many technologies, such as Internet, Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, WiFi, GPRS, 3G, etc., which can enable different ways to obtain the location information of various objects. Location-based service is a primary service of the IOT, while localization accuracy is a key issue. In this paper, a higher accuracy localization scheme is proposed which can effectively satisfy diverse requirements for many indoor and outdoor location services. The proposed scheme composes of two phases: (1) the partition phase, in which the target region is split into small grids; (2) the localization refinement phase, in which a higher accuracy of localization can be obtained by applying an algorithm designed in the paper. A trial system is set up to verify correctness of the proposed scheme and furthermore to illustrate its feasibility and availability. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the localization accuracy.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) as an emerging network paradigm is bringing the next scientific and technological revolution for ubiquitous things' interactions in cyber-physical-social spaces. The IoT influences the current science and technology system by enabling its relatively stable interrelations for an inevitable architecture reconfiguration. In this paper, we aim to explore an updated science and technology framework for the IoT. Particularly, a novel cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) space is established by involving an attractive concept of the Internet of Thinking (IoTk), and a science and technology framework is accordingly proposed referring to both scientific aspect (i.e., cyber-physical, social, and noetic sciences) and technological aspect (i.e., fundamental, physical, cyber, and social technologies). According to the perspective of the traditional Chinese culture, we explain the established science and technology framework, in which the ``Five Elements'' (i.e., wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) have common properties with the restructured cyber-physical science in the IoT. Moreover, we introduce a scenario of smart city to identify the technological aspect in the IoT, and discuss the key enabling technologies, including resource management, energy management, data management, session management, security and privacy, loop control, space-time consistency, nanotechnology, and quantum technology. It turns out that the established science and technology framework will launch an innovation for academia and industry communities.",

abstract="With the recent development of Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) and the potential of Cyber Physical System (CPS), people's daily activities become smarter, and intelligent. The combination of CIoT and CPS can greatly enhance the quality of people's life. To this end, this article proposes CIoT-CPS that comprises of two main models: user activity cognitive model and image authentication model.The user activity cognitive model (UACM) is a machine-learning model to have the meaningful data. The image authentication model is to verify the authenticity of images captured by various devices, such as smart phones, digital cameras, and other camera-embedded portable devices. The authenticity of an image is breached when parts of images are assembled to produce a new image (known as a splicing forgery), or a part of an image is copied or pasted into another part of the same image (known as a copy-move forgery). In the proposed verification method, an opposite color local binary pattern (OC-LBP) texture descriptor is applied to a questioned image. The image is first decomposed into an RGB (red, green, blue) and a luminance and chroma color spaces. The OC-LBP measures the interrelation between pixels of different color components. The intensive computation involving six color components and a gray version is performed in the cloud, where a server can be dedicated to doing this job. The histograms of the OC-LBP are concatenated with weights to produce a final feature vector of the image. A support vector machine is applied as a classifier, which classifies the image as authentic or forged. Several experiments were performed to verify the suitability of those models or approaches. The proposed approaches show a good accuracy compared to other competing approaches.",

abstract="Collusion attacks are among the major security concerns nowadays due to the growth exposure in networks and communications. Internet of Things (IoT) environments are an attractive target for such type attacks. This paper discusses the problem of collusion attacks in IoT environments and how mobility of IoT devices increases the difficulty of detecting such types of attacks. It demonstrates how approaches used in detection collusion attacks in WSNs are not applicable in IoT environments. To this end, the paper introduces a model based on Fog Computing infrastructure to keep track of IoT devices and detect collusion attackers. The model uses fog computing layer for realtime monitoring and detection of collusion attacks in IoT environments. Moreover, the model uses a software defined systems layer to add a degree of flexibility for configuring Fog nodes to enable them to detect various types of collusion attacks. The paper provides algorithms, theorems, lemmas and mathematical proofs of the proposed model. Furthermore, the it highlights the possible overhead on fog nodes and network when applying the proposed model, and claims that fog layer infrastructure can provide the required resources for the scalability of the model. The experiments show how the proposed model can keep track of malicious nodes while moving from one cluster to other clusters in IoT environments in contrary to the models used in WSNs. Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed model can bear the computation overhead effectevilly, and reduces the power consumption of aggregator nodes in comparison to the models used in WSNs.",

Alternatively, functionalities can be outsourced to the cloud. In reality, there is no single solution that fits all needs. Cooperation between devices, intermediate infrastructures (local networks, access networks, global networks) and/or cloud systems is needed in order to optimally support IoT communication and IoT applications. Through distributed intelligence the right communication and processing functionality will be available at the right place.

In this paper, we propose an efficient device authentication protocol without certification authority for the Internet of Things. Compared to the existing Constrained Application Protocol, the proposed protocol increases efficiency by minimizing the number of message exchanges. Since our protocol is based on a keyed hash algorithm, the Certificate of Authority is not required.

These challenges include the co-existence of wireless technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth and WIFI, cross-layer communications, high packet loss due to interferences with electronic devices, etc. Similarly, IoT is a new paradigm for interconnecting electronic devices, thus, it needs major refinement for standardising it for various services. In order to address the aforementioned challenges, we proposed a scheme for enabling a generic IoT framework and platform for various IoT embedded devices. The working of the proposed scheme is twofold, (1) discovering and collecting information from IoT enabled devices using sensors and (2) scheduling the working of these appliances based on the data collected using sensors attached to these devices. Further, the data is transferred to Hadoop ecosystem for processing and analyzing to disseminate the relevant information to the citizen. Moreover, the proposed system is tested in a smart home scenario by installing sensors attached to various home appliances. The energy consumption and packet loss occur due to available electronic appliances, and heterogeneous devices are computed and analyzed for planning an optimal scheduling scheme and load balancing.

The major problems facing by blind people fall in the category of navigating through indoor and outdoor environments consisting of various obstacles and recognition of person in front of them. Identification of objects or person only with perceptive and audio information is difficult. An intelligent, portable, less expensive, self-contained navigation and face recognition system is highly demanded for blind people. This helps blind people to navigate with the help of a Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) and a system equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Face recognition can be done using neural learning techniques with feature extraction and training modules. The images of friends, relatives are stored in the database of user Smartphone. Whenever a person comes in front of the blind user, the application with the help of neural network gives the voice aid to the user. Thus this system can replace the regular imprecise use of guide dogs as well as white sticks to help the navigation and face recognition process for people with impaired vision.In this paper, we have proposed a novel image recognition and navigation system which provides precise and quick messages in the form of audio to visually challenged people so that they can navigate easily.

In this article, based on organizational capability perspective, we provide a theoretical framework which classifies IoT strategies into four archetypes from two dimensions of managers' strategic intent and industrial driving force, and propose that market-based exploratory capabilities play a more important role for firms adopting get-ahead strategy, and market-based exploitative capabilities play a more important role for firms adopting catch-up strategy in market. The technology-based exploratory capabilities play a more important role for firms adopting get-ahead strategy in technology, and technology-based exploitative capabilities play a more important role for firms adopting catch-up strategy in technology. Especially, external industry information sharing more efficiently contributes to the enhancement of both market-based and technology-based exploratory capabilities, and internal industry information sharing more efficiently contributes to the enhancement of both market-based and technology-based exploitative capabilities.",

abstract="A rapidly increasing world population is not only directly related with increased urban mobility but also traffic delays, losses in fuel, air and noise pollution as well as physiological and psychological problems in the population. Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node's bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city's adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies. Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines. Sections four to six explain how the experiment is set up to test the hypothesis that over 99{\%} accuracy in vehicular detection can be achieved with the proposed system when cross-referenced with the actual acoustic, magnetic and video presence and absence of a test vehicle.",

abstract="IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between ``everything'', IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytic tools are able to extract ``sense'' from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.",

In association with rapid development of IoT smart sensor applications, real-time processing of huge-amount of data for a video signal has become necessary leading to video compression technology. Motion estimation (ME) is necessary for improving the quality, but it has high computational complexity in video compression system. The present article, therefore, proposes a context-aware adaptive pattern-based ME algorithm for multimedia IoT platform to improve video compression. In the proposed algorithm, the motions are classified into large or small based on distortion value. Accordingly, the search pattern is chosen either small diamond search pattern (SDSP) or large diamond search pattern (LDSP) in each and every step of ME; allowing adaptive processing of large and small abstract information. Compared to conventional fast algorithms, the experimental results demonstrate up to 40 and 36{\%} reduction in encoding time for low-delay main (LB-main) and random access main (RA-main) profiles respectively in HEVC test model 16.10 encoder with bit-rate loss of 0.071 and 0.246{\%} for both the profiles, ensuring quality video and searching precision.",

The VCCA selects the cluster head (CH) that has the highest network capacity through a classification process of cluster variables in accordance with the characteristics in order to configure a clustered network, which differs for different IoT applications. To achieve this, the VCCA employs a fuzzy inference system (FIS) that calculates an outcome through rule-based variable mapping for low complexity in the CH election and high scalability of cluster variables. In addition, experimental simulations using MATLAB are conducted to evaluate the performance of the VCCA. The simulation results show that the VCCA exhibits better network performance compared to the existing algorithms in terms of throughput, end-to-end latency, network lifetime, and energy consumption.",

To ensure the reliability of end-to-end transmission in the hierarchical environments, fault management is of great importance. Current relative algorithms are designed for specific network, not suited to these complex conditions. Meanwhile, the utilization of existing facilities should be considered for implementation feasibility. In this paper, we propose a layered fault management scheme for IoT with uniform fault managing procedure control and separate layer functions. Flexible and effective monitoring model would be set in selected observing points around the networks. Advanced fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) is adopted to realize integrated evaluation and prediction of the possible fault. The observing points could adjust the weighting rule in the model to suit the practical network condition and work independently. After further confirmation among neighbor points, fault recovery therapy could be handed over to the corresponding network with existing counter-measures. The proposed design suits well to the efficiency and feasibility requirements of IoT. Simulation results further prove its desirable behavior.",

With the emergence of the smart devices beginning from smart phones extends to the general electronic devices such as smart tv sets, refrigerators, washing machines, robot vacuums, and so on. Such smart devices make it possible to collect the device-usage logs of end users whereby a system is able to analyze it to find the usage patterns of the end users and make recommendations to the end users. Furthermore, this allows to make recommendations on the individual users since the smart devices have their own identifiers such as MAC address and IPv6 address. The smart devices also have matched information with the end user id/s. In this study, we propose a method for analyzing the devise-usage patterns in semi-real time based on the big-data system architecture. We also present a recommendation framework which makes device-usage recommendations by using a rule-based system architecture with the analyzed usage patterns. Lastly, we introduce a segmentation-based analysis and recommendation framework to make recommendations based not only on his or her own usage patterns, but also on the common usage patterns of the users who are living in a similar context. The segmentation is formed also based on the types of the device usages, so that the analysis can be performed in a batch process thereby enabling to make the recommendations in real time based on the pre-analyzed usage patterns.",

abstract="Progression of the internet technologies has led to the emergence of internet of things (IoT). One of the familiar deployment of IoT is through radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. In recent times, RFID based systems are one of the most widely spread applications for tagging and keep tracking purposes in IoT deployment. This is due to their powerful features compared to their counterparts of similar techniques such as barcodes. In contrast, radio-frequency identification systems suffer from various attacks and security threats. The wireless channel used for communication is responsible for the majority of these vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a new radio-frequency identification authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to eliminate these vulnerabilities. In addition, we use elliptic curve Diffie--Hellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol to generate a temporary shared key used to encrypt the later transmitted messages. Our protocol achieves a set of security properties likes mutual authentication, anonymity, confidentiality, forward security, location privacy, resistance of man-in-the-middle attack, resistance of replay attack and resistance of impersonation attack. We implement our proposed protocol in real RFID system using Omnikey smartcard reader (Omnikey 5421) and NXP Java smartcards (J3A040). Implementation results shows that our proposed protocol outperform in term of time complexity as compared to other similar protocols and requires less number of operations.",

abstract="With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) that offers capabilities to identify and connect worldwide physical objects into a unified system, the importance of modeling and processing IoT data has become significantly accentuated. IoT data is substantial in quantity, noisy, heterogeneous, inconsistent, and arrives at the system in a streaming fashion. Due to the unique characteristics of IoT data, the manipulation of IoT data for practical applications has encountered many fundamental challenging problems, such as data modeling and processing. This paper proposes the infrastructure for an IoT prototype system that aims to develop foundation models for IoT data. We illustrate major modules in the IoT prototype, as well as their functionalities, and provide our vision of the key techniques used for tacking the critical problems in each module.",

abstract="An internet of things system is expected to integrate the sensing, communication, networking, and cloud computing technologies in large-scale monitoring environments. The main monitoring infrastructure of internet of things systems is wireless sensor networks. Energy saving becomes one of the most important features for the sensing nodes to extend their lifetime in such systems. To provide reasonable energy consumption and to improve the network lifetime for the internet of things systems, efficient energy saving schemes must be developed. In this paper, a distributed cluster computing energy-efficient routing scheme is proposed to reduce the energy consumption and to extend the network lifetime for the internet of things systems. The main goal of this scheme is to reduce the data transmission distances of sensing nodes by using the cluster structure concepts. A center of gravity among the sensing nodes is calculated and the residual energy of each sensing node is taken into account in the cluster for selecting a suitable cluster head node. Based on the suitable cluster architecture, the data transmission distances between the sensing nodes can be reduced. The energy consumption is reduced and the lifetime is extended for the sensing nodes by balancing the network load. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the previously known schemes in terms of the energy consumption and network lifetime for the internet of things systems.",

abstract="The IOT infrastructure - IP-based mobile sensor network- makes it possible to provide two-directional communication between mobile sensors and the remote server. Mobility direction prediction is a major challenge in IP-based networks by which we can predict the next movement direction of moving objects carrying mobile node(s). In this paper, we have introduced a Distributed Self-Healing Movement Prediction scheme for IOT applications, so-called DSHMP-IOT, to predict movement direction of mobile IP-based sensors in a multi-user environment, such as a health-care system. This is the first time that an AI solution is applied to predict the direction of the mobile node(s) in an IP-based mobile network. The proposed scheme takes advantage of Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) to predict the movement direction with high accuracy and low overhead. The previous works for estimating the direction of a mobile node(s) in IP-based mobile networks are based on AOA, a hardware-specific method. The proposed scheme has several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for special hardware (directional antenna, an antenna array, etc.) which is required in AOA based methods. Second, it is not sensitive to noise, speed and sudden changing of movement direction which cause false positive movement direction prediction in AOA method. Third, in this context, it is the only work with self-healing capability whenever one or more static sensors fail(s). Fourth, it includes a recovery mechanism which prevents the mobile node from being disconnected in case of false prediction of our learning model. The simulation results show the superiority of our scheme regarding power consumption and hand-off delay, as well as packet loss, compared to similar approaches.",

Nowadays, IoT is considered as one of the main technologies which contribute towards reshaping our daily lives in the next decade. IoT unlocks many exciting new opportunities in a variety of applications in research and industry domains. However, many have complained about the absence of the real-world IoT data. Unsurprisingly, a common question that arises regularly nowadays is ``Does the IoT already exist?''. So far, little has been known about the real-world situation on IoT, its attributes, the presentation of data, and user interests. To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More specifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler engine to collect large-scale real-world IoT data for the first time. We make the results of our work available to the public in order to assist the community in the future research. In particular, we collect the data of nearly two million Internet connected objects and study trends in IoT using a real-world query set from an IoT search engine. Based on the collected data and our analysis, we identify the typical characteristics of IoT data. The most intriguing finding of our study is that IoT data is mainly disseminated using Web Mapping while the emerging IoT solutions such as the Web of Things are currently not well adopted. On top of our findings, we further discuss future challenges and open research problems in the IoT area.",

Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring. We investigate the existing approaches by considering the elderly requirements at the center of the attention. In addition, we evaluate the main objectives and trends in IoT-based elderly monitoring systems in order to pave the way for future systems to improve the quality of elderly's life.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging global infrastructure that employs wireless sensors to collect, store, and exchange data. Increasingly, applications for marketing and advertising have been articulated as a means to enhance the consumer shopping experience, in addition to improving efficiency. However, privacy advocates have challenged the mass aggregation of personally-identifiable information in databases and geotracking, the use of location-based services to identify one's precise location over time. This paper employs the framework of contextual integrity related to privacy developed by Nissenbaum (Privacy in context: technology, policy, and the integrity of social life. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2010) as a tool to understand citizen response to implementation IoT-related technology in the supermarket. The purpose of the study was to identify and understand specific changes in information practices brought about by the IoT that may be perceived as privacy violations. Citizens were interviewed, read a scenario of near-term IoT implementation, and were asked to reflect on changes in the key actors involved, information attributes, and principles of transmission. Areas where new practices may occur with the IoT were then highlighted as potential problems (privacy violations). Issues identified included the mining of medical data, invasive targeted advertising, and loss of autonomy through marketing profiles or personal affect monitoring. While there were numerous aspects deemed desirable by the participants, some developments appeared to tip the balance between consumer benefit and corporate gain. This surveillance power creates an imbalance between the consumer and the corporation that may also impact individual autonomy. The ethical dimensions of this problem are discussed.",

Traditional batteries in IoT produce environmental concerns and have limited operational life. Harvesting and converting ambient environmental energy is an effective and important approach for sustainable green power used in wireless and portable devices in IoT. This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art development of different energy harvesting sources including mechanical, light/solar, wind, sound, RF, biomechanical and pyroelectric energy. Power density generated from ambient source ranges widely from 0.001 $\mu$W/cm2 (RF WiFi) to 100 mW/cm2 (outdoor solar). Depends on application areas and working principles, typical power consumptions of IoT sensor nodes are in the order of mW (1--750 mW) in active mode and $\mu$W (0--60 $\mu$W) in sleep mode (Mathna et al. in Talanta 75:613--623, 2008; Magno et al. in IEEE Trans Ind Electron 61:1871--1881, 2014; Baranov et al. in Sens Actuators A 233:279--289, 2015; Somov et al. in Procedia Eng 87:520--523, 2014; Spirjakin et al. in Sens Actuators A 247:247--253, 2016; Samson et al. in Sens Actuators A 172:240--244, 2011). Therefore, efficient energy storage and management strategies are important for IoT development. These parts are discussed in order to provide the sustainable power. MEMS based energy harvesting devices may be widely employed in various areas, such as military monitoring, remote weather station, bluetooth headsets, and environment detection.

As reported by investigating agencies of many countries, routinely engagements of defence personnel are one of the premier reasons for vulnerability to national defence through intentional and unintentional information outflow of defence secrets. The work presented in this research is focused on monitoring various activities of defence personnel to determine his/her integral behavior in daily life. Specifically, Integrity Index Value is defined for every defence personnel based on different social engagements, and activities for detecting the vulnerability to national security. In addition to this, a probabilistic decision tree based automated decision making is presented to aid defence officials in analyzing various activities of a defence personnel for his/her integrity assessment. In order to validate the proposed framework, three challenging data sets have been considered for experimental evaluation.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next evolutionary paradigm of networking technologies that interconnects almost all the smart objects and intelligent sensors related to human activities, machineries, and environment. IoT technologies and Internet Protocol connectivity enable wide ranges of network devices to communicate irrespective of their resource capabilities and local networks. In order to provide seamless connectivity and interoperability, it is notable to maintain secure end-to-end (E2E) communication links in IoT. However, device constraints and the dynamic link creations make it challenging to use pre-shared keys for every secure E2E communication scenario in IoT. Variants of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) are adopted for constructing dynamic and secure E2E connections among the heterogeneous network devices with imbalanced resource profiles and less or no previous knowledge about each other. We propose a solution called collaborative HIP (CHIP) with an efficient key establishment component for the high resource-constrained devices in IoT. CHIP delegates the expensive cryptographic operations to the resource rich devices in the local networks. Finally, by providing quantitative performance evaluation and descriptive security analysis, we demonstrate the applicability of the key establishment in CHIP for the constrained IoT devices rather than the existing HIP variants.",

abstract="Secret image sharing is the study of sharing a secret image with several participants to prevent the malicious participant obtaining information about the secret image. Traditional methods generate meaningless shares, which are unintelligible and easily lead to suspicions of secret image encryption. Rather, sharing methods with steganography were studied.

In this proposed method, secret shares are generated from the cover image and secret information, and the shares of IoT services are embedded back to the cover image based on on                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}4{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            2                      4                                                                    -ary notational system, which creates stego-shadow images.

To be successful in practice, the IoT solutions should create ``income-centric'' values beyond the conventional ``traceability-centric'' values. To accomplish what we promised to users, sensor portfolios and information fusion must correspond to the new requirements introduced by this income-centric value creation. In this paper, we propose a value-centric business-technology joint design framework. Based on it the income-centric added-values including shelf life prediction, sales premium, precision agriculture, and reduction of assurance cost are identified and assessed. Then corresponding sensor portfolios are developed and implemented. Three-tier information fusion architecture is proposed as well as examples about acceleration data processing, self-learning shelf life prediction and real-time supply chain re-planning. The feasibilities of the proposed design framework and solution have been confirmed by the field trials and an implemented prototype system.",

abstract="With internet of things vision, computing systems get the ubiquity of real world. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology plays a critical role for the construction of this paradigm. Hence, WSN technology should be adapted to support interoperability with the commodity internet entities. Since technological background of WSN and IP networks do not fit each other, this effort is not a straightforward process. In this paper, we introduce WiSEGATE which addresses end-to-end reliable interconnection problem between multiple internet entities and sensor nodes. WiSEGATE is a prototype of a new web server which supports three tier service scheme with a data acquisition mechanism of WSN to access the physical data in particular locations in the real world. In WiSEGATE, an interconnection gateway handles operations required for the interoperability. Since this gateway maintains reliable TCP/IP connections of the interconnected entities, the resource constraint sensor nodes on WSN do not require a TCP/IP stack for handling end-to-end connections. A lightweight service layer is implemented on a sensor node for operations required by the interconnection. The strength and novelty of the model lies in the fact that this lightweight service layer relieves extra memory usage for end-to-end connection management. For determining limits of the proposed model, firstly, we examined the steps for request/response mechanism and modeled the gateway as a queueing system. By doing this, we derive a definition of the request traffic. For proof of concept, we performed comprehensive tests in simulation and real testbed environments for WLAN connection. WiSEGATE can achieve reasonable response times up to 80 simultaneous connections from remote entities to WSN when WLAN PER is less than 0.2.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) technologies are advancing rapidly and a wide range of physical networking alternatives, communication standards and platforms are introduced. However, due to differences in system requirements and resource constraints in devices, there exist variations in these technologies, standards, and platforms. Consequently, application silos are formed. In contrast to the freedom of choice attained by a range of options, the heterogeneity of the technologies is a critical interoperability challenge faced by IoT systems. Moreover, IoT is also limited to address new requirements that arise due to the nature of the majority of smart devices. These requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, are hardly satisfied by the current IoT technologies following the end-to-end model inherited from the Internet. This paper introduces a lightweight, distributed, and embedded service bus called LISA which follows a Node Centric Networking architecture. LISA is designed to provide interoperability for resource-constrained devices in IoT. It also enables a natural way of embracing the new IoT requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, through node centric networking. LISA provides a simple application programming interface for developers, hiding the variations in platform, protocol or physical network, thus facilitating interoperability in IoT systems. LISA is inspired by network on terminal architecture (NoTA), a service centric open architecture originated by Nokia Research Center. Our extensive experimental results show the efficiency and scalability of LISA in providing a lightweight interoperability for IoT systems.",

This is because IoT devices support health tracking, security monitoring, consumer tracking, forecasting, and so on. However, the huge interconnectedness in IoT architectures complicates traceability and faulty data propagation is not easily detected since there are challenges with data origin authentication. Thus, this research proposes a provenance technique to deal with these issues. The technique is based on associative rules and lexical chaining methodologies, which enable traceability through the identification of propagation routes of data and object-to-object communications. Through visualization tools, the proposed methodologies also enabled us to determine linkability and unlinkability between IoT devices in a network which further leads to mechanisms to check correctness in sensor data propagation.",

A middleware can ease application development by providing the necessary functional components for service registration, discovery and composition. Recently, there have been a large number of proposals for IoT middleware solutions, and a few recent studies have surveyed and qualitatively evaluated these IoT middleware proposals against a variety of functional features. This paper is an extension of these studies with an evaluation of four representative middlewares in a small-scale scenario to provide a more in-depth perspective of the state of the art with reference to the scale and heterogeneity of dynamic IoT environments. The results show a number of issues. Service registration, discovery and composition components still require human intervention. With such a large number of available services, these components need to be automated to enable fast deployment and adaptation of IoT applications. The scalability evaluation of new proposals should follow a holistic approach, as opposed to considering only individual components. Finally, support for user's non-functional requirements is limited to best-effort QoS.",

The innovative design for the IoT paradigm has mainly based on ``Virtualization technology'' to provide the full interaction for the user within the system environment. Meanwhile, it alleviates potential system complications. In this end, this paper seeks to introduce a new vision of an IoT virtualization framework based on Sensor-as-a-Service (SenaaS) to maximize the utilization of sensor functionalities. Moreover, the paper offers an adaptor oriented structure technique by using ITA Sensor Fabric (aka Information Fabric) which relies on Publish/Subscribe mechanism to realize an oriented communication between things. In our proposed framework, ITA Sensor Fabric used as a parallel measure with the semantic approach for mitigating the principle issues in the sensor arena. Furthermore, the proposed framework uses Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSA) to enhance the SenaaS performance with the time-sensitive services and ensure the required level of the Quality of Service (QoS). The effectiveness of the proposed framework tested by using MATLAB and NS2-based simulations in terms of delay time, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and jitter. Finally, all the experimental results proved that BSA has a significant influence on the time-sensitive services more than their analogues of algorithms.",

abstract="The pervasive use of smart objects is encouraging the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where even the most common and simple object is expected to acquire information from the surrounding ambient and to cooperate with other objects to achieve a common goal . In such a heterogeneous and complex scenario, optimal allocation of resources to application tasks (e.g., available energy, computing speed, storage capacity) is paramount to fairly distribute them and not overload some objects. In this paper, we focus on finding the optimal assignment to the physical devices that can perform the same task needed by the running applications. To this, we rely on the technologies that have been already developed around the notion of Virtual Object (VO), which is the digital counterpart of the physical object and is used to augment its functionalities with the use of virtualization technologies. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we extend the current functionalities of VOs to make them capable of implementing a distributed strategy for the allocation of tasks among objects: the information model is enhanced to include the Quality of Information (QoI) notion and the possible different architectural solutions are presented. Secondly, we propose a distributed algorithm where VOs negotiate to reach a consensus on resources allocation, in order to distribute the workload among the objects that can cooperate to the same task and to ensure that the QoI requirements are fulfilled. Simulation results show that, compared to a static frequency allocation, the algorithm enhances the performance of the system with an average improvement of 27{\%} in network lifetime and confirms the compliance to QoI requirements.",

abstract="Wireless networking in the Internet of Things is a challenging problem because a huge amount of devices in a relatively small region need to be interconnected. Particularly, the carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) operation of IoT devices is not viable solution, since dense network leads to high channel contentions. Moreover, given an intensive network traffic load, long queues or even queue overflows are expected, which further deteriorates network performance. To address these issue, multichannel medium access is proposed and it attracts great attention recently. In this paper, we firstly establish models based on combinatorics theory to analyze the performance of dynamic multichannel medium access. Then, a Cross-layer Cooperative Multichannel Medium Access (CCMMA) is proposed to effectively avoid channel contentions by enabling neighboring devices to communicate on orthogonal channels. The CCMMA also introduces a routing-enhanced mechanism that enables relaying nodes to wake up intelligently if there is incoming traffic, that successfully mitigates delay and queue overflow problems caused by low-power operation of IoT devices. The performance of CCMMA is evaluated through extensive simulations. The results show that it provides significant improvement in terms of quality of service over existing solutions.",

The energy created by hybrid renewable energy sources are dependent on the variation and load demand, such a renewable power system must be equipped for fulfilling the necessities whenever and store the extra power for usage in deficiency situations. An independent renewable energy network to meet the coveted electric load with some sources, little excess power and minimal cost of energy. The essential goal of the design criteria is to limit the entire cost which incorporates initial, operational and support cost. In this work life-cycle cost (LCC), loss of load probability (LOLP) and loss of power supply probability (LPSP) have considered as the genuine factors and a Generous Transformational Optimization Algorithm (GTOA) has projected to pick the greatest possible configuration of a hybrid power framework. Internet of Things (IoT) conveyed in crossover control framework and gave a valuable proposition about assorted advances and norms of a renewable power source, and it additionally gives a review of a few applications and driving variables of a hybrid control framework. Simulation work done with MATLAB software and result helps the efficiency of the proposed technique and confirm that it is 97{\%} efficiency than other ordinary strategies.",

Smart objects will be the building blocks of the next generation of applications that will exploit interaction between machines to implement enhanced services with minimum or no human intervention in the loop. A crucial factor to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications is a horizontal service infrastructure that seamlessly integrates existing IoT heterogeneous systems. The authors present BETaaS, a framework that enables horizontal M2M deployments. BETaaS is based on a distributed service infrastructure built on top of an overlay network of gateways that allows seamless integration of existing IoT systems.

This paper proposes and evaluates a model for the psychology of the wireless node interactions in the context of IoT and the selection of a partner for the most reliable communication, depending on the needs of the service required. The key functions of the proposed model are the Influence and the Behavior functions.

abstract="In internet of things (IoT) study, to determine that the location of an event is the key issue, realize that a target location in IoT is one of the research hotspots by using the multihop range-free method. Multihop range-free could obtain relatively reasonable location estimation in the isotropic network, however, during the practical application, it tends to be affected by various anisotropic factors such as the electromagnetic interference, barriers and network attack, which can significantly reduce its performance. In accordance with these problems faced by multihop range-free, this paper proposes a novel IoT localization method: location estimation-kernel partial least squares (LE-KPLS). First of all, this method uses kernel function to define the connectivity information (hop-counts) between nodes, then, the maximum covariance is used to guide and build the inter-node localization model, and then, this model and the hop-counts between the unknown nodes and beacons are used to estimate the coordinate of the unknown nodes. Compared to the existing methods, the LE-KPLS has a high localization precision, great stability and strong generalization performance, without having a high requirement of the number of beacons, and it can well adapt to numerous complicated environments.",

abstract="Recently, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has drawn considerable attention from both industry and academia. In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie--Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT.",

To avoid the weaknesses, we present a new authentication scheme which is also for WSNs.

abstract="In this article, we present a unified perspective on the cognitive internet of things (CIoT). It is noted that within the CIoT design we observe the convergence of energy harvesting, cognitive spectrum access and mobile cloud computing technologies. We unify these distinct technologies into a CIoT architecture which provides a flexible, dynamic, scalable and robust network design road-map for large scale IoT deployment. Since the prime objective of the CIoT network is to ensure connectivity between things, we identify key metrics which characterize the network design space. We revisit the definition of cognition in the context of IoT networks and argue that both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency are key design constraints. To this end, we define a new performance metric called the `overall link success probability' which encapsulates these constraints. The overall link success probability is characterized by both the self-sustainablitiy of the link through energy harvesting and the availability of spectrum for transmissions. With the help of a reference scenario, we demonstrate that well-known tools from stochastic geometry can be employed to investigate both the node and the network level performance. In particular, the reference scenario considers a large scale deployment of a CIoT network empowered by solar energy harvesting deployed along with the centralized CIoT device coordinators. It is assumed that CIoT network is underlaid with a cellular network, i.e., CIoT nodes share spectrum with mobile users subject to a certain co-existence constraint. Considering the dynamics of both energy harvesting and spectrum sharing, the overall link success probability is then quantified. It is shown that both the self-sustainability of the link, and the availability of transmission opportunites, are coupled through a common parameter, i.e., the node level transmit power. Furthermore, provided the co-existence constraint is satisfied, the link level success in the presence of both the inter-network and intra-network interference is an increasing function of the transmit power. We demonstrate that the overall link level success probability can be maximized by employing a certain optimal transmit power. Characterization of such an optimal operational point is presented. Finally, we highlight some of the future directions which can benefit from the analytical framework developed in this paper.",

abstract="This paper proposes a novel registration and super-resolution jointed paradigm for medical images under the Internet of thing environment. In the medical image processing, the matching issue is one catches wide attention with the domain of research. Image registration technique can be divided into similarity measure, optimization, geometric transformation, and interpolation, etc. As the first essential clue of our model, we propose the novel registration algorithm based on energy feature extraction. Generally, the matching energy function by the similarity measurement and a penalty constitution is called the external force and endogenic force separately. The matching is an external force and endogenic force mutual competition, eventually achieves the balanced process. Furtherly, we integrate the game analysis and area feature selection to achieve the better image super-resolution mode through the pretreatment of the image to change the initial value, so as to achieve the purpose of improving the performance. Besides the algorithm level innovation, we integrate the GPU and the IOT to construct the hardware based implementation of the proposed medical image processing system. The latency of registers to read and write data across a GPU's entire storage system is minimal, it is private to each thread, and can only be accessed by its owning thread. For each thread, the local memory is also private and it is often used to deal with the problem of overflow register, reducing the buffer overflow caused by the entire application of a substantial decline in the possibility and shared memory is visible to all threads within the thread block. We then achieve the optimal integration of IOT and GPU. The experimental result proves the robustness of the method.",

Performance rank (PR) index is calculated for each mobile ambulance based on the medical capacity (b) of the mobile ambulance, the number of patients currently using the mobile ambulance (n), and the Euclidean distance from a neighboring mobile ambulance. The minimum PR index is considered as best ambulance to provide a service to the patient. Random waypoint mobility model is used to simulate the proposed IoT based healthcare monitoring system. The proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm is compared with various node selection algorithms such as cluster based routing protocol, workload-aware channel assignment algorithm and scenario-based clustering algorithm for performance evaluation. The packet delivery fraction, normalized routing load and average end-to-end delay are calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm.

The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) is underpinned by the integration or mass customization of services and/or goods. The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as goods and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced as ``ServGoods'', resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage to the industrialized countries where the consuming customers are at the same time the co-producing producers.

In such a framework, technologies proposed under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a significant rule in facing the challenges. In video surveillance, the cameras can be considered as ``the things'' that are streaming videos to a central processing and storage server (the cloud) through the Internet. Wireless technologies can be used to connect wireless cameras to the surveillance system more conveniently than wired cameras. Unfortunately, wireless communication in general tend to have limited bandwidth that needs careful management to achieve scalability. In this paper, we design and evaluate a reliable IoT-based wireless video surveillance system that provides an optimal bandwidth distribution and allocation to minimize the overall surveillance video distortion. We evaluate our system using NS-3 simulation. The results show that the proposed framework fully utilizes the available cloud bandwidth budget and achieves high scalability.",

The decentralized approach can be enabled using manufacturing objects that are capable of negotiating with their environment, observing it, making decisions according to these observations, and sharing information on their status and needs. For these purposes, automatic identification (auto-ID) technology is required. Automatic identification involves techniques for automatically identifying things by using tokens with individual codes, collecting information on them, and transferring that information automatically into computer systems. In general, not only techniques such as barcode, optical character recognition (OCR), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) are associated with auto-ID but also other techniques that are less used in manufacturing can be highlighted.

abstract="The increasing momentum of the Internet of Things (IoT) leaded to the development of a huge number of applications in different domains. Those applications are based on different standards and protocols, making therefore the IoT landscape widely fragmented. In this context, the evolution of Web semantic technologies together with the popularity of Cloud computing represents a solution to enable the horizontal integration of various IoT applications and platforms. This is what the Cloud of Things (CoT) aims to achieve. In this paper, we propose the design of a gateway for the Cloud of Things. The proposed gateway is able to manage semantic-like things and at the same time to act as an end-point for the presentation of data to users. Moreover, thanks to the use of virtualized software---which introduces a negligible impact in terms of performance---the gateway enables a lightweight and dense deployment of services. The paper describes the above technologies and how to combine them in order to design the gateway. Furthermore, we provide information about use cases, hardware, performance evaluation, and future hints to enhance the gateway.",

In this paper, the notion of Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) is proposed in order to address this issue. As inspired by the material cycle in the physical world, the W2T focuses on the data cycle, namely ``from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.''

The paper extends the state-of-the-art literature by proposing a pioneering roadmap to enhance the application of CE principles in organisations by means of Industry 4.0 approaches. Advanced and digital manufacturing technologies are able to unlock the circularity of resources within supply chains; however, the connection between CE and Industry 4.0 has not so far been explored. This article therefore contributes to the literature by unveiling how different Industry 4.0 technologies could underpin CE strategies, and to organisations by addressing those technologies as a basis for sustainable operations management decision-making. The main results of this work are: (a) a discussion on the mutually beneficial relationship between Industry 4.0 and the CE; (b) an in-depth understanding of the potential contributions of smart production technologies to the ReSOLVE model of CE business models; (c) a research agenda for future studies on the integration between Industry 4.0 and CE principles based on the most relevant management theories.",

abstract="A Web-oriented architecture using REST framework is proposed to enable warehouse objects to communicate over the Web. In the proposed mechanism, the smart warehouse consists of a data collection module and an administrative module. The former includes a collection of radio-frequency identification sensors to read RFID tags of the products, wireless sensors for operational data collection, and the actuators. It is responsible for the data collection process of products and goods stored in the warehouse as well as the collection of operational parameters, i.e. temperature, humidity, air quality, and pressure. The latter acts as the brain of the smart warehouse by processing data, organizing data, generating events, and executing actions. The warehouse user is provided with the environment to control the functionality of various sensors, things, appliances, and HAVC system of warehouse through the Web. An event decision system is built on top of the Web architecture to control real-time processing of the sensors, things, etc. In the proposed architecture, the smart gateway consists of two layers, namely transport module (TM) and device service module (DSM). The combination of TM and DSM creates the device controller for embedded devices operating on proprietary protocols. The proposed system is simulated and evaluated in various scenarios in context of discovery time, response time, and transmission failure. Its effect is seen in the form of improved performance of warehouse in quick interaction and in high accuracy as well.",

However, there are many security issues such as privacy and security of healthcare data which need to be considered once we introduce wearable devices to the healthcare service. Although some of the security issues were addressed by some researchers in the literature, they mainly addressed cloud of things security or healthcare security separately and their work still suffers from limited security protection and vulnerabilities to some security attacks. The proposed new healthcare system combines security of both healthcare and cloud of things technologies. It also addresses most of the security challenges that might face the healthcare services such as the man in the middle (MITM), eavesdropping, replay, repudiation, and modification attacks.

The experimental results show that our new model has strong practicability for the data mining of Social media stocks.

However, there is a controversy about what production paradigm is emerging along with the incoming new industrial revolution. Most focus is either on smart manufacturing or 3D printing (additive manufacturing). This study converges smart manufacturing and additive manufacturing to form the long tail of making things as a paradigm shift for the new industrial revolution, which results in an ideal production system with the advantages of both economies of scale and scope. With the introduction of social aspects, socio-cyber-physical system (SCPS)-based manufacturing is proposed from the organizational semiotic perspective and exemplified by the four pillars of Future Internet. Furthermore, an extended version of the long tail is formed by the two modes of SCPS-based manufacturing: wisdom manufacturing and social manufacturing, which reviewed as the logical extension of smart manufacturing and additive manufacturing, respectively. Finally, a general interoperability model for SCPS-based manufacturing is suggested, which can also be applied to other integrated manufacturing systems.",

In this paper, we discuss how those technologies can be integrated together and fit into a seamless cycle like the one proposed in the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T). We also provide two case studies from our EiA project. The first case study is to demonstrate how a concept first tested in a virtual environment can be successfully implemented in the real world later when technological advances finally caught up. The data collection step and the ability to manually control smart objects of the W2T cycle are fulfilled in this step. The second case study is to show how the software simulator and hardware implementation are abstracted from the underlying algorithm, and thus, it serves as an example of how virtual worlds can be used as a test bed for W2T, especially with regards to the development of the remaining steps of the W2T cycle.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN) are becoming more and more relevant and are likely to spread everywhere, due to their numerous applications and benefits. In fact, they are a key element in the vision of the so called Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the lack of central control and the existence of incentives for cheating lead to the necessity of defining mechanisms for identifying well-behaving WSANs. Reputation based solutions have been suggested in the literature in order to cope with these situations, but most of them were focused on finding a specific most trustworthy sensor, capable of provisioning a requested service. Our work, however, is oriented to provide a mobile user with an accurate reputation-based mechanism allowing her to select, amongst a set of available WSANs, the most reputable one, according to the recommendations given by other users. Thus, the mobile user can build her own opinion and consequently decide which is the best WSAN to interact with. This decision will be based in her own criteria, which might be different from other users of the same service. In order to prevent the abuse of the proposed reputation system, we suggest a mechanism avoiding multiple recommendations from the same user in a specific time frame. Additionally, we handle certain privacy issues by hiding the real identity of a user behind a group. The experiments performed show the accuracy, scalability and robustness of our proposal, called WSANRep, within several scenarios, considering the existence of malicious recommenders and malicious service providers.",

An emerging paradigm of communication architecture for IoTs support is Fog computing in which events are processed near to the place they occur for efficient and fast response time. One of the major concerns in the adoption of Fog computing based publish-subscribe protocols for the Internet of things is the lack of security mechanisms because the existing security protocols such as SSL/TSL have a large overhead of computations, storage and communications. To address these issues, we propose a secure, Fog computing based publish-subscribe lightweight protocol using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for the Internet of Things.

More than 50 {\%} of the world's population are affected by these diseases. If suitable steps are not taken during the early stages then severe complications occur from these diseases. In the work proposed, we have discussed the manner in which the Internet-of-Things based Cloud centric architecture is used for predictive analysis of physical activities of the users in sustainable health centers. The architecture proposed is based on the embedded sensors of the equipment rather than using wearable sensors or Smartphone sensors to store the value of the basic health-related parameters. Cloud centric architecture is composed of a Cloud data center, Public cloud, Private cloud, and uses the XML Web services for secure and fast communication of information. The architecture proposed here is evaluated for its adoption, prediction analysis of physical activities, efficiency, and security. From the results obtained it can be seen that the overall response between the local database server and Cloud data center remains almost constant with the rise in the number of users. For prediction analysis, If the results collected in real time for the analysis of physical activities exceed any of the parameter limits of the defined threshold value then an alert is sent to the health care personnel. Security analysis also shows the effective encryption and decryption of information. The architecture presented is effective and reduces the proliferation of information. It is also suggested, that a person suffering from any of the diseases mentioned above can defer the onset of complications by doing regular physical activities.",

The Internet of Things' sensors are deployed to monitor one or more events in an unattended environment. A large number of event data will be generated over a period of time in the Internet of Things. In the future, hundreds of billions of smart sensors and devices will interact with one another, without human intervention. Also, they will generate a large amount of data and resolutions, providing humans with information and the control of events and objects, even in remote physical environments. However, the demands of the Internet of Things cause heavy traffic or bottlenecks on particular nodes or on the paths of Internet of Things networks. Therefore, to resolve this issue, we propose an agent, Loadbot, that measures network loads and processes structural configurations by analyzing a large amount of user data and network loads. Additionally, in order to achieve efficient load balancing in the Internet of Things, we propose applying Deep Learning's Deep Belief Network method. Finally, using mathematical analysis, we address the key functions of our proposed scheme and simulate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.",

pages="515--540",
abstract="In the paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as the evolving Web of Things (WoT) and the emerging Wisdom Web of Things (W2T), not only can the data collected by the sensor nodes (i.e., the things) in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) be transmitted to and processed at Internet nodes and subsequently transformed into information, knowledge, wisdom and eventually into services to serve humans, but human users can also access, control and manage the sensor nodes in the WSNs through nodes in the Internet. Since data are the basis for enabling applications and services in W2T, it becomes imperative that enabling technologies for end-to-end security be developed to secure data communication between Internet user nodes and sensor server nodes to protect the exchange of data. However, traditional security protocols developed for the Internet rely mostly on symmetric authentication and key management based on public key algorithms, thus are deemed to be unsuitable for WSNs due to resource constraints in the sensor nodes. Specifically, acting as the server nodes in this scenario, sensor nodes cannot take on the heavy duty like regular servers in the Internet. Meanwhile, current security mechanisms developed for WSNs have mainly focused on the establishment of keys between neighboring nodes at the link layer and thus are not considered to be effective for end-to-end security in the W2T scenario. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end secure communication scheme for W2T in WSNs in which we follow an asymmetric approach for authentication and key management using signcryption and symmetric key encryption. In our proposed scheme, a great part of the work for authentication and access control is shifted to a gateway between a WSN and the Internet to reduce the burden and energy consumption in the sensor nodes. In addition, our scheme can ensure the privacy of user identities and key negotiation materials, and denial of service (DoS) attacks targeted at the sensor nodes can be effectively blocked at the gateway. We will also conduct quantitative analysis and an experiment to show that our proposed scheme can enhance the effectiveness of end-to-end security while reducing the cost of sensor nodes in terms of computation, communication and storage overhead as well as the latency of handshaking compared to similar schemes that are based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.",

abstract="This paper discusses the repercussions of a new metaphysics---speculative/weird realism---for education and pedagogy. A historic shift is taking place in present-day continental philosophy, which involves an explicit and renewed call for realism. One of the most salient features of this development is a revitalised interest in ontological questions. As part of this overall trend towards realist and materialist ontologies in current continental thinking, the paper particularly focuses on Graham Harman's object-oriented ontology, which claims that aesthetics is first philosophy. Harman's object-oriented philosophy is an approach to metaphysics and ontology that is enamored by the experience of the vibrant yet inscrutable autonomous reality of objects. In order to come to terms with this new approach to reality, I suggest education be conceived as the cultivation of an aesthetic attitude understood as the ability to uphold the tension between relational and non-relational aspects of objects understood in the Harmanian idiom.",

At the moment, consumer-oriented RFID research is scarce and fragmented. This paper seeks to chart the RFID territory, address the research that is readily available, and conclude with a call for a more encompassing research agenda on RFID and consumers.

In this paper, we propose a concept for supporting a collaboration augmentation of devices used in the IoT. The Device-Rank for the augmenting collaboration of things proposed in this paper is a technology used to rate IoT things based on diverse elements such as the frequency with which users use individual things, the distances to users or service objects, the network QoS, the performance of the things, and their operation histories, such that the resultant information can be used by a cloud-based platform or device itself to calculate the Device-Rank information. This Device-Rank is expected to be accumulated and updated by things or a platform, and exchanged between things such that things can more actively collaborate with other things or services and augment the Device-Rank with the passing of time.",

Under the Industry 4.0, the scheduling should deal with a smart and distributed manufacturing system supported by novel and emerging manufacturing technologies such as mass customization, Cyber-Physics Systems, Digital Twin, and SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud). The scheduling research needs to shift its focus to smart distributed scheduling modeling and optimization. In order to transferring traditional scheduling into smart distributed scheduling (SDS), we aim to answer two questions: (1) what traditional scheduling methods and techniques can be combined and reused in SDS and (2) what are new methods and techniques required for SDS. In this paper, we first review existing researches from over 120 papers and answer the first question and then we explore a future research direction in SDS and discuss the new techniques for developing future new JSP scheduling models and constructing a framework on solving the JSP problem under Industry 4.0.",

abstract="Current telehealth systems are used to improve the treatment of chronic diseases by collecting medical data at the patient and transferring them to a remote medical institution. Research shows that such medical practice can be substantially improved if the measured parameters are greater in number and of more diverse nature. Emerging consumer solutions for monitoring personal health and wellness, as well as various resources from domains like internet, telecommunications and smart living, can be used as possible sources for exploration of an individual's wider health context. It was our aim to design an internet of things solutions, which would combine these sources of information into context information, complementary to health data. An internet of things platform was designed and implemented and integration with an established e-health system was provided to enrich telehealth data with context information by aggregating and processing cross-domain inputs from various sources. The approach was validated on a use case scenario. The concept was tried in a scenario related to prevention and management of heart disease. The system's advanced graphic correlation features are expected to help physicians and patients identify true roots of health problems. Medical researchers are also expected to benefit from a deeper insight into complex cross-domain parameter dependencies that determine an individual's health.",

abstract="The wide use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in manufacturing shop-floor creates an opportunity to turn the traditional manufacturing factories into smart ones. The synchronous operation between the real shop-floor frontline and virtual production management system is vital in the establishment of smart factories. However, managing a wide variety of sensing devices and processing the large amount of raw captured manufacturing data are difficult for general production operators. In this article, the Coloured Petri net (CPN) technology is combined with IoT technologies to establish an active sensing system of real-time and multi-source manufacturing information (CPN-MIASS). It aims to establish a systematic graphics-based modelling approach for the sensing of manufacturing information and the management of sensor, which can assist the general operators in monitoring and controlling the real-time manufacturing process easily and dynamically. Based on this system and its key components, the multiple sensors can be managed in a `Plug-and-play' manner, and the high-level manufacturing information can be obtained efficiently. In addition, a prototype system is used to validate the usability of the proposed CPN-MIASS.",

abstract="Confronted with growing sustainability awareness, mounting environmental pressure, manufacturers are seriously striving to address sustainability-related issues without sacrificing customers' needs and market competitiveness. A new manufacturing system called cybermanufacturing system (CMS) has great potential in addressing sustainability issues by handling manufacturing tasks differently from and better than traditional manufacturing systems. CMS is a vision for future manufacturing where physical components are fully integrated and seamlessly networked with computational processes, forming an on-demand, intelligent, and communicative manufacturing resource and capability repository with optimal, sustainability-oriented manufacturing solutions. The recent developments in the Internet of things, cloud computing, fog computing, service-oriented technologies, etc., all contributed to the development of CMS. In this new manufacturing paradigm, every manufacturing resource or capability is digitalized, registered, and networked to each other directly or through the Internet, thus enabling intelligent behaviors of manufacturing components and systems such as self-awareness, self-prediction, self-optimization, and self-configuration, among others. In this research, a comprehensive definition of CMS has been developed, a suggested architecture of CMS has been constructed, and important functions of CMS have been identified. Simulation models have been developed and used to investigate the sustainability benefits of CMS. The simulation results show promising sustainability benefits of CMS over traditional manufacturing systems.",

In parallel, a growing number of personal and portable devices, like smartphones and tablet computers, are becoming capable of taking the role of health gateway, that is, a data collector for the sensor PHDs. However, as the number of PHDs increase, the number of other peripherals connected in PAN also increases. Therefore, PHDs are now competing for medium access with other devices, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of health applications in the PAN. In this article we present a reference architecture to prioritize PHD connections based on their state and requirements, creating a healthcare Smart Gateway. Healthcare context information is extracted by observing the traffic through the gateway. A standard-based approach was used to identify health traffic based on ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards. A reference implementation was developed showing the relevance of the problem and how the proposed architecture can assist in the prioritization. The reference Smart Gateway solution was integrated with a Connected Health System for the Internet of Things, validating its use in a real case scenario.",

abstract="Information Systems (ISs) have become one of the crucial tools for various organizations in managing and coordinating business processes. Now we are entering the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a paradigm in which real-world physical things can be connected to the Internet and provide services through the computing devices attached. The IoT infrastructure is starting to be integrated with ISs thereby diminishing the boundaries between the physical world and the business IT systems. With the development of IoT technologies, the number of connected things and their available physical services are increasing rapidly. Thus, selecting an appropriate service that satisfies a user's requirements from such services becomes a time-consuming challenge. To address this issue, we propose a Physical Service Model (PSM) as a common conceptual model to describe heterogeneous IoT physical services. PSM contains three core concepts (device, resource, and service) and specifies their relationships. Based on the proposed PSM, we define three types of Quality of Service (QoS) attributes and rate candidate services according to user requirements. To dynamically rate QoS values and select an appropriate physical service, we propose a Physical Service Selection (PSS) method that takes a user preference and an absolute dominance relationship among physical services into account. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

abstract="In an earlier paper (Tien 2015), the author defined the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance. Finally, just as the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age on October 4, 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the U.

abstract="The focus of this paper is upon how people handle the sharing of personal data as an interactional concern. A number of ethnographic studies of domestic environments are drawn upon in order to articulate a range of circumstances under which data may be shared. In particular, a distinction is made between the in situ sharing of data with others around you and the sharing of data with remote parties online. A distinction is also drawn between circumstances of purposefully sharing data in some way and circumstances where the sharing of data is incidental or even unwitting. On the basis of these studies, a number of the organisational features of how people seek to manage the ways in which their data is shared are teased out. The paper then reflects upon how data sharing practices have evolved to handle the increasing presence of digital systems in people's environments and how these relate to the ways in which people traditionally orient to the sharing of information. In conclusion, a number of ways are pointed out in which the sharing of data remains problematic and there is a discussion of how systems may need to adapt to better support people's data sharing practices in the future.",

abstract="Drug compliance and adverse drug reactions (ADR) are two of the most important issues regarding patient safety throughout the worldwide healthcare sector. ADR prevalence is 6.7 {\%} throughout hospitals worldwide, with an international death rate of 0.32 {\%} of the total of the patients. This rate is even higher in Ambient Assisted Living environments, where 15 {\%} of the patients suffer clinically significant interactions due to patient non-compliance to drug dosage and schedule of intake in addition to suffering from polypharmacy. These instances increase with age and cause risks of drug interactions, adverse effects, and toxicity. However, with a tight follow-up of the drug treatment, complications of incorrect drug use can be reduced. For that purpose, we propose an innovative system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for the drug identification and the monitoring of medication. IoT is applied to examine drugs in order to fulfill treatment, to detect harmful side effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, liver/renal contradictions, and harmful side effects during pregnancy. The IoT design acknowledges that the aforementioned problems are worldwide so the solution supports several IoT identification technologies: barcode, Radio Frequency Identification, Near Field Communication, and a new solution developed for low-income countries based on IrDA in collaboration with the World Health Organization. These technologies are integrated in personal devices such as smart-phones, PDAs, PCs, and in our IoT-based personal healthcare device called Movital.",

abstract="As medical technology has been developing, patients' information (medical information, disease information, etc.) has been diversely used in medical services so that patients' biometric information can be used for remote diagnosis and examinations. However, since the complexity and uncertainty of patient treatment have been increasing, doctors' burden due to hospital work has been also increasing. In the present paper, an analytic hierarchy process based patient information management scheme is proposed that can synchronize diverse medical devices used for patient treatment to hierarchically manage patients' disease information. The purpose of the proposed scheme is to analyze the correlations of medical devices used in medical treatment of patients to induce hierarchical management of patients' disease information through triangle fuzzy of pairwise comparison scales for medical treatment and efficiently perform not only hospital administrative work but also patients' disease analysis and treatment. In addition, using the patients' disease information collected through diverse medical devices, the proposed scheme improves the efficiency of patient treatment methods so that hospitals can calculate the importance of treatment standards in order to hierarchically identify treatment standards. Furthermore, since the proposed scheme enables efficiently selecting treatment methods for patients' diseases, it has a characteristic of being capable of efficiently improve the ambiguousness and inaccuracy of treatment judgments and treatment compared to existing disease treatment methods. According to the results of performance evaluation, the proposed scheme improved work efficiency by 11.9{\%} over existing techniques and reduced medical device administration costs by 10.9{\%}. Furthermore, the proposed scheme improved patients' satisfaction with treatment by 23.6{\%}.",

abstract="The design of large scale telecommunication networks is more than the technical allocation of capacity and path routing. By examining the design and allocation of resources in a broader sense, telecommunication network planning and management can better deliver value to the various stakeholders. This is significant especially when deploying networks in economically marginal areas such are rural, remote, or economically depressed regions. This paper presents a planning framework to systematically incorporate the influences, resources and decisions to effectively build or expand a network. Using a stake holders, input, process, output, customer approach, six key areas of society that derive value from better communication infrastructure in relatively unique manners were identified. These areas include healthcare, education, business, and others. The framework presented defines the inputs and outputs that accounts for the range of influences and outcomes in a network planning process. Inputs are broken down into four areas of concern (technical, market, financial, and application trends) that can influence how a network could be designed, along with four output areas (auxiliary activities, deployment strategies, technical design, and ownership and access).

abstract="With the rising trend of the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases all over the world, proactive healthcare systems with wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have attracted people's extensive attention. One of the researches, such as routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) only takes into consideration a single metric, energy, hops or routing quality, and so on. To extend the survival time of the network effectively and maximize the utilization of energy, we need to consider both node metric and link metric that affect the network, and design IRPL (Improved RPL) protocol. We propose the life cycle index (LCI) as path selection objective function. The index takes node metric (node energy and node hops) and link metric (throughput, packet loss, link quality) into consideration. In order to detect and distribute congestion information, we add congestion detection factor to the index. According to node energy, hop and congestion detection factor, we optimize the calculation method of rank. Our method redesigns parent node selection strategy. Not only does the strategy select the best parent node by using the improved index, but also saves other parent nodes that meet the conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a multipath scheme by using the DODAG structure, and use the scheme to solve the congestion problem. The simulation results show that the scheme shows better performance in terms of network load, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, percentage of the optimal parent node change, energy consumption and network lifetime.",

Integrating logistic services, resources, and necessary information flows in the supply chain to ensure efficiency and efficacy is critically important to these companies. Global logistic service companies face challenges from their clients to provide logistic services that are cost effective, accurate, and seamlessly integrate material, information and cash flows. In this research, an improved framework for one-stop logistic services is systematically designed, analyzed, and evaluated. The one-stop logistic service framework, defined in four models, is developed to provide enterprises with integrated and comprehensive services within the global supply chain context. The levels of service importance are assessed using a four categories questionnaire. This research provides a case study of the implementation of one-stop logistic services in the distribution industry and demonstrates the framework operating under different demand conditions. Finally, system dynamics causal evaluation is used to evaluate the advantages of the logistic service framework.",

abstract="The world is confronted with a variety of interdependent problems, including scarcity, unsustainability, inequality, pollution and poor governance. Tackling such complex challenges requires coordinated action. The present paper proposes the development of a self-organizing system for coordination, called an ``offer network'', that would use the distributed intelligence of the Internet to match the offers and needs of all human, technological and natural agents on the planet. This would maximize synergy and thus minimize waste and scarcity of resources. Implementing such coordination requires a protocol that formally defines agents, offers, needs, and the network of condition-action rules or reactions that interconnect them. Matching algorithms can then determine self-sustaining subnetworks in which each consumed resource (need) is also produced (offer). After sketching the elements of a mathematical foundation for offer networks, the paper proposes a roadmap for their practical implementation. This includes step-by-step integration with technologies such as the Semantic Web, ontologies, the Internet of Things, reputation and recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, governance through legal constraints and nudging, and ecosystem modeling. The resulting intelligent platform should be able to tackle nearly all practical and theoretical problems in a bottom-up, distributed manner, thus functioning like a Global Brain for humanity.",

Initial discussions were focused on exploring the impact of a common digital communication network in the feedback architecture. Results on addressing communication network artifacts, such as time delays, packet dropouts, and limited communication capability due to signal quantization are thoroughly examined. Several one-channel feedback NCS configurations were presented and analyzed with focus on nonstationary packet dropouts. State, observer-based and Output feedback control design methods over a shared digital communication network are treated. Recent developments pertaining to quantized control and estimation methods are reported. A concise account of event-based control and filtering schemes is presented. Finally, the concept of cloud control systems is discussed in this paper, which is an extension of networked control systems (NCS). With the development of Internet of Things (IOT), the technology of NCSs has played a key role in IOT. Cloud computing is developed rapidly, which provides a perfect platform for big data processing, controller design, and performance assessment.

To diminish the impact of mass adoption of EVs, this paper proposes an optimization model aimed at maximizing the trade revenue for EV' aggregator for enabling the smart charging. Further, to circumvent the possibility of damage to the EV battery, real-time Battery Monitoring System (BMS) using less complex and easy to implement Enhanced Coulomb Counting Method for SoC estimation and messaging based MQTT as the communication protocol is presented.

In this context media (i.e., video) transmission is considered as a quite significant step during first hour of the emergency for presenting a big and better picture of the event. However, the energy hungry media transmission process and slow progress in battery technologies have become a major and serious problem for the evolution of video technology in medical internet of things (MIoT) or internet of medical things (IoMT). So, promoting Green (i.e., energy-efficient) transmission during voluminous and variable bit rate (VBR) video in MIoT is a challenging and crucial problem for researchers and engineers. Therefore, the need arose to conduct research on Green media transmission techniques to cater the need of upcoming wearable healthcare devices. Thus, this research contributes in two distinct ways; first, a novel and sustainable Green Media Transmission Algorithm (GMTA) is proposed, second, a mathematical model and architecture of Green MIoT are designed by considering a 8-min medical media stream named, `Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis' to minimize transmission energy consumption in media-aware MIoT, and to develop feasible media transmission schedule for sensitive and urgent health information from physian to patients and vice vers through extremely power hungry natured wearable devices.

abstract="Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers, depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.",

Today, RFID technology is being applied in a wide array of disciplines in science research and industrial projects. The significant impact of RFID is clearly visible by the rate of academic publications in the last few years. This article surveys the literature to evaluate the trend of RFID technology development based on academic publications from 2001 to 2014. Both bibliometric and content analyses are applied to examine this topic in SCI-Index and SSCI-Index documents. Based on the bibliometric technique, all 5159 existing RFID documents are investigated and several important factors are reviewed, including contributions by country, organizations, funding agencies, journal title, authors, research area and Web of Science category. Moreover, content analysis is applied to the top 100 most cited documents and based on their contents, these top 100 documents are classified into four different categories with each category divided in several sub-categories. This research aims to identify the best source of the most cited RFID papers and to provide a comprehensive road map for the future research and development in the field of RFID technology in both academic and industrial settings. Six key findings from this review are (1) the experimental method is the most popular research methodology, (2) RFID research has been a hot area of investigation but will branch out into related subset areas, (3) South East Asia is positioned to dominate this research space, (4) the focus of research up to now has been on technical issues rather than business and management issues, (5) research on RFID application domains will spread beyond supply chain and health care to a number of different areas, and (6) more research will be related to policy issues such as security and privacy.",

abstract="As IoT technologies have become more available, healthcare patients increasingly want to be provided with services at places other than hospitals or their homes. Most patients with implantable devices still visit hospitals, sometimes using a self-driving car or public transportation to obtain services. When an emergency situation develops for a patient in a vehicle lacking the means to address the crisis, the patient's life cannot help but be in danger. The present paper proposes an IoT healthcare service model that will enable patients with a medical sensor to be provided healthcare services in a vehicle installed with IoT devices. To solve problems in existing models that do not include electromagnetic interference-based (EMI) multiple property management and control, the proposed model involves medical sensors with different multiple-property information guarantee targeted SINRs and minimum blackouts. The model also features the ability to connect to hospital healthcare service centers using the IoT devices installed in vehicles, thereby enabling information on the patient's condition and first aid needs to be transmitted in real time. To secure the patient's biometric data during information transmission, the proposed model weights that information to enhance the efficiency of the IoT devices. Performance evaluation results revealed that compared to existing algorithms, the communication strength of the proposed model is an average of 5.2{\%} higher, and network efficiency between IoT devices and medical sensors is an average of 7.6{\%} higher. In addition, the overhead on IoT devices was an average of 3.5{\%} lower.",

The TENG has seen enormous progress to date, particularly in applications for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing. It starts with the simple working principles of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction, but can scavenge almost any kind of ambient mechanical energy in our daily life into electricity. Extraordinary output performance optimization of the TENG has been achieved, with high area power density and energy conversion efficiency. Moreover, TENGs can also be utilized as self-powered active sensors to monitor many environmental parameters. This review describes the recent progress in mainstream energy harvesting and self-powered sensing research based on TENG technology. The birth and developmentof the TENG are introduced, following which structural designs and performance optimizations for output performance enhancement of the TENG are discussed. The major applications of the TENG as a sustainable power source or a self-powered sensor are presented. The TENG, with rationally designed structures, can convert irregular and mostly low-frequency mechanical energies from the environment, such as human motion, mechanical vibration, moving automobiles, wind, raindrops, and ocean waves. In addition, the development of self-powered active sensors for a variety of environmental simulations based on the TENG is presented. The TENG plays a great role in promoting the development of emerging Internet ofThings, which can make everyday objects connect more smartly and energy-efficiently in the coming years. Finally,the future directions and perspectives of the TENG are outlined. The TENG is not only a sustainable micro-power source for small devices, but also serves as a potential macro-scale generator of power from water waves in the future.",

Handling these data causes great challenges since their processing must occur in a timely manner. Furthermore, the exchanged data must be kept at a minimum in order to efficiently use network resources of constrained devices. Complex event processing (CEP) is an established approach frequently employed to address these challenges. There are many existing means to automatically provision CEP systems, such as Docker or Ansible. However, the resulting instances are generic and need customization to be applied to Internet of Things scenarios. More precisely, data sources and sinks need to be bound and queries need to be defined. This customization is a tedious task when conducted manually. To cope with these issues, we present an approach based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications standard, which enables the customization and provisioning of CEP systems including all required data sources and sinks, as well as queries to process the data.",

abstract="Good governance is necessary to make cities resilient and sustainable. To achieve this, we propose the Responsive City, in which citizens, enabled by technology, take on an active role in urban planning processes. Adequate planning of Responsive Cities requires a change and evolvement of the role of policy-makers, government experts, urban planners, and architects. A key factor is hereby the understanding of urban dynamics. In this paper we present a method to model the dynamics of the city from the viewpoint of the urban metabolism as a system of stocks and flows. Understanding these flows helps to identify the main characteristics of the city and advances the knowledge of relationships between different stocks and flows in the system. Big Data can inform and support this process with evidence by taking advantage of behavioural data from infrastructure sensors and crowdsourcing initiatives. They can be overlaid with spatial information in order to respond to events in decreasing time spans by automating the response process partially, which is a necessity for any resilient city management.

abstract="Maintenance of assembly and manufacturing equipment is crucial to ensure productivity, product quality, on-time delivery, and a safe working environment. Predictive maintenance is an approach that utilises the condition monitoring data to predict the future machine conditions and makes decisions upon this prediction. The main aim of the present research is to achieve an improvement in predictive condition-based maintenance decision making through a cloud-based approach with usage of wide information content. For the improvement, it is crucial to identify and track not only condition related data but also context data. Context data allows better utilisation of condition monitoring data as well as analysis based on a machine population. The objective of this paper is to outline the first steps of a framework and methodology to handle and process maintenance, production, and factory related data from the first lifecycle phase to the operation and maintenance phase. Initial case study aims to validate the work in the context of real industrial applications.",

Recently, inspired by IoT and WoO, the era of connecting all the things and people is coming. Unfortunately, various devices and objects in IoT environments hardly show the method for automatic connection and the cooperation applied to IoT applications and services. Firstly, in this paper we propose WoO based on the architecture which contains various devices and objects for providing Web base IoT services and applications.

abstract="The internet of things (IoT) attracts great interest in many application domains concerned with monitoring and control of physical phenomena. However, application development is still one of the main hurdles to a wide adoption of IoT technology. Application development is done at a low level, very close to the operating system and requires programmers to focus on low-level system issues. The underlying APIs can be very complicated and the amount of data collected can be huge. This can be very hard to deal with as a developer. In this paper, we present a runtime model based approach to IoT application development. First, the manageability of sensor devices is abstracted as runtime models that are automatically connected with the corresponding systems. Second, a customized model is constructed according to a personalized application scenario and the synchronization between the customized model and sensor device runtime models is ensured through model transformation. Thus, all the application logic can be carried out by executing programs on the customized model. An experiment on a real-world application scenario demonstrates the feasibility, effectiveness, and benefits of the new approach to IoT application development.",

The Internet of Things enabled applications will radically change the interactions between humans and the environment, thus security being a key-point of this ecosystem. One of the most important Internet of Things enabled scenarios is the smart city, this application having a direct impact on multiple social areas: smart lighting, smart roads, noise urban maps and many others. Smart city objects will interact with both humans and machines, implementing multiple communication protocols. Taking this into consideration, integrating smart city objects with social networks is a logical step, even though this idea implies multiple security issues and innovative big data processing systems. Social networks represent a platform where both machines and humans can exchange messages, being an information source and sink for the smart city objects. This paper presents a security architecture where social networks enable an adaptive sensing-as-a-service system. Smart city objects, which need additional information beside the one obtained from the sensors, collect it from the most trusted nodes on the social network. This system enables an autonomic computing mechanism where smart objects have a reputation built on the feedback received from both human and other nodes, a certain degree of trust being transferred to all the nodes which contributed to the publication of reliable information.",

As a paradigm shift of that trend the present article explores the use of semiconductor manufacturing variations for enhancing security of systems using FinFET technology as an example. FinFETs were introduced to replace high-                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}kappa {\$}{\$}                                                            $\kappa$                                                       transistors in nanoelectronic applications. From microprocessors to graphic processing units, FinFETs are being used commercially today. Along with the technological advancements in computing and networking, the number of cyber attacks has also increased. Simultaneously, numerous implementations of the Internet of Things are already present. In this environment, one small security flaw is enough to place the entire network in danger. Encrypting communications in such an environment is vital. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can be used to encrypt device to device communications and are the main focus of this paper. PUFs are hardware primitives which rely on semiconductor manufacturing variations to generate characteristics which are used for this purpose. Two different designs of a ring oscillator PUF are introduced, one with low power consumption trading off device performance and one high-performance trading off device power consumption. There is an 11{\%} decrease in power consumption with the low power model along with a simple design and fabrication. Performance of the device can be increased with almost no increase in power consumption.",

abstract="In the past (few) years a lot of research and development projects were proposed concerning the implementation of smart home environment, sometimes even called an intelligent environment, comforting people who use various adaptations of internet of things and services. This paper advocates an opinion that a set of electronically controlled smart things must be intellectualized using human-type reasoning. A novel approach and new algorithms for the hierarchical fuzzy training, retraining, and self-training for intellectualized home environments are proposed in this paper. Training algorithms based on fuzzy logic use top-down hierarchical analysis of home situations under consideration to conquer the curse of increasing number of rules. A successful combination of crisp algorithms for the identification of presence/absence of users in the environment with fuzzy logic-based algorithms for corresponding rules subsets development and processing enables the number of necessary rules to decrease significantly. In the paper a case is presented with the starting number of 2500 rules which later diminished approximately 5 times. For the first time, the changes in users' wishes are taken into account during the retraining process. An entirely new ability of the system was investigated, and a fuzzy logic-based algorithm for initiating a self-training process without any a priori information is developed as well. The vitality and efficiency of the proposed methodology was tested and simulated on a specialized virtual software/hardware modeling system. The proposed and simulated algorithms are delivered for use in two industrial projects.",

The ubiquitous manufacturing (UbiM) technology, including radio frequency identification (RFID) technique, is employed to automate real-time data acquisition and processing for an order fulfilment. An MEC model for the order fulfilment is constructed according to the bill of materials (BOM). In this model, the computation is triggered by an RFID read event (RRE) enabling a digital energy metre to acquire energy consumption value of a workstation for processing a certain material, and then the acquired value is assigned to an energy consumption event (ECE). To reflect the effect of an ECE on energy consumption of a production task, a station-material energy consumption matrix (smECM) is constructed to store the relevant event data, which plays a key role in alleviating MEC monitoring restrictions caused by big energy data. By operating the matrix, the MEC monitoring information can be effectively extracted. To assist manufacturing enterprises to better employ it, the proposed method was demonstrated by monitoring MEC of an order in an auto-part manufacturer.",

month="Nov",
day="11",
abstract="The Internet of healthcare things is essentially a new model that changes the way of the delivery and management of healthcare services. It utilizes digital sensors and cloud computing to present a quality healthcare service outside of the classical hospital environment. This resulted in the emergence of a new class of online web 4.0 services, which are termed ``cloud healthcare services''. Cloud healthcare services offer a straightforward opportunity for patients to communicate with healthcare professionals and utilize their personal IoHT devices to obtain timely and accurate medical guidance and decisions. The personal IoHT devices integrate sensed health data at a central cloud healthcare service to extract useful health insights for wellness and preventive care strategies. However, the present practices for cloud healthcare services rely on a centralized approach, where patients' health data are collected and stored on servers, located at remote locations, which might be functioning under data privacy laws somewhat different from the ones applied where the service is running. Promoting a privacy respecting cloud services encourages patients to actively participate in these healthcare services and to routinely provide an accurate and precious health data about themselves. With the emergence of fog computing paradigm, privacy protection can now be enforced at the edge of the patient's network regardless of the location of service providers. In this paper, a framework for cloud healthcare recommender service is presented. We depicted the personal gateways at the patients' side act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between IoHT devices and cloud healthcare services. A fog-based middleware will be hosted on these fog nodes for an efficient aggregation of patients generated health data while maintaining the privacy and the confidentiality of their health profiles. The proposed middleware executes a two-stage concealment process that utilizes the hierarchical nature of IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. At that, the patients will be empowered with a tool to control the privacy of their health data by enabling them to release their health data in a concealed form. The further processing at the cloud healthcare service continues over the concealed data by applying the proposed protocols. The proposed solution was integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the patients' health data when utilized by a cloud healthcare recommender service to generate health insights. Our approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both patients and service providers.",

In order to watch the level of water quality various techniques were implemented in the areas of water in various localities like monitoring of drinking water quality, management of water quality and irrigation water, lakes, treatment, and ponds. In this technology, the development of it for system monitoring of water quality processes as a core technology by the wireless sensor network (WSN). However, the networking process is to monitor the water quality using a sensor nodes lightweight and tiny-powered gathering. Nevertheless, in the application environment the development process of technology is proceeding without security consideration, which creates a confidentiality susceptibility of the system. In this research process, the major contribution is to develop a secure process of a modern monitoring system of water quality based on wireless sensor network. Successively, the embedded system depends on secure IoT is planned using WSN, which can resource fully realize those necessities.",

abstract="`Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce `big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city.",

abstract="In a critical environment, e.g. in a factory where an employee faces hazardous conditions, monitoring the health status of the employee is important. Thus, continuous connectivity of the employee to the network is the main concern of such networks. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in hazardous areas like factory. The proposed mobility structure for hazardous areas, called MSHA, organizes static nodes as a tree for an efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. MSHA is capable of handling multiple failures of static nodes which disconnect a mobile node from the network. MSHA is highly scalable regarding the number of mobile nodes and the size of the covered monitoring area. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on different factors. The results reveal the superiority of MSHA compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the performance (about 20{\%}) of MSHA specifically in reducing packet loss and hand-off delay caused by the failure of the static nodes. The performance does not degrade with increasing the number of mobile nodes.",

In order to ground our Nutriflect approach, we conducted 125 structured interviews in grocery stores. Informed by the results of this exploratory study, we designed a system that shows a household's collective food consumption patterns via situated displays in the home and through mobile devices in-store. The system aimed to minimize the need for manual entry of nutrition-related data by the users. To evaluate our system, we conducted a 4-week field study in eight households with 21 inhabitants and situated in-store shopping inquiries with a subset of 9 of these users, using actual shopping data from participants. In these studies, we identified issues regarding the interaction design of Internet of Things applications and explored the use of complementary distributed displays to provide tailored cues in context. The approach taken showed the potential to foster reflection about shopping and nutritional choices and for integration with people's everyday practices.",

pages="63--70",
abstract="Medication adherence is essential for the success of home care. However, it is hard to achieve in reality. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional medication assistance system that is composed of a sensor-enabled pill box and a photo message system. While most of the existing medication assistance systems enhance medication adherence by properly alerting the patients; our bidirectional system does it by the enhancement of information sharing and communications between patients and medical staff. The medication dosage states of a patient are detected by a hall-effect sensor attached to the lid of an off-the-shelf pill box. The sensor data is transferred over a ZigBee network located in the patient's home and is stored in a cloud database through a 3G mobile network. Since the raw sensor data might contain erroneous open-close events of the pill box, we developed a data filtering function to eliminate the false-positive events. With the data filtering function, we improved the accuracy of medication monitoring from 60{\%} to 85{\%} during our three-month experiment involving seven patients. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the photo message system that home visiting nurses can use to communicate with the patient. The missed medication ratio was improved from 15{\%} to 4{\%} after the photo message system was installed. The effectiveness of the photo message system continued for two months after the initiation. We also interviewed 15 medical staff about the effectiveness of the medication monitoring with the sensor-enabled pill box and the photo message system.",

The framework differentiates three groups of activities (design and features, measurement and value, management and organization) at four levels of analysis (users and society, intermediaries, platforms, firms and industry). The review shows that research has predominantly focused on technological questions of design and features, while neglecting application, value creation, and governance.

abstract="We describe an ontological model for representation and integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) data and apply it to detect human emotional states. The model (BIO{\_}EMOTION) is an ontology-based context model for emotion recognition and acts as a basis for: (1) the modeling of users' contexts, including user profiles, EEG data, the situation and environment factors, and (2) supporting reasoning on the users' emotional states. Because certain ontological concepts in the EEG domain are ill-defined, we formally represent and store these concepts, their taxonomies and high-level representation (i.e., rules) in the model. To evaluate the effectiveness for inferring emotional states, DEAP dataset is used for model reasoning. Result shows that our model reaches an average recognition ratio of 75.19 {\%} on Valence and 81.74 {\%} on Arousal for eight participants. As mentioned above, the BIO-EMOTION model acts like a bridge between users' emotional states and low-level bio-signal features. It can be integrated in user modeling techniques, and be used to model web users' emotional states in human-centric web aiming to provide active, transparent, safe and reliable services to users. This work aims at, in other words, creating an ontology-based context model for emotion recognition using EEG. Particularly, this model completely implements the loop body of the W2T data cycle once: from low-level EEG feature acquisition to emotion recognition. A long-term goal for the study is to complete this model to implement the whole W2T data cycle.",

abstract="The cloud operating system (cloud OS) is used for managing the cloud resources such that they can be used effectively and efficiently. And also it is the duty of cloud OS to provide convenient interface for users and applications. However, these two goals are often conflicting because convenient abstraction usually needs more computing resources. Thus, the cloud OS has its own characteristics of resource management and task scheduling for supporting various kinds of cloud applications. The evolution of cloud OS is in fact driven by these two often conflicting goals and finding the right tradeoff between them makes each phase of the evolution happen. In this paper, we have investigated the ways of cloud OS evolution from three different aspects: enabling technology evolution, OS architecture evolution and cloud ecosystem evolution. We show that finding the appropriate APIs (application programming interfaces) is critical for the next phase of cloud OS evolution. Convenient interfaces need to be provided without scarifying efficiency when APIs are chosen. We present an API-driven cloud OS practice, showing the great capability of APIs for developing a better cloud OS and helping build and run the cloud ecosystem healthily.",

abstract="Realization of the cloud computing infrastructure requires access to data anywhere, anytime at any device at a sufficient perceived quality of service. Many Western European countries, such as Denmark, have a high percentage of individuals (inhabitants and companies) that has access to broadband internet via cable, satellite and mobile. This gives a unique position in roll-out and deploying intelligent cloud based services that can be applied for a number of purposes, but where lack of sufficient capacity/quality and IT readiness will be barriers in realization of the ``Global Information Multimedia Communication Village (GIMCV)''. Broadband is here defined as more than 2 Mbps. In this paper, the combination of e-commerce, cloud computing and broadband infrastructure has our focus, and its unique possibilities for the overall IT society. However, it is also about a significant number of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) that today applies manual billing systems or Excel like systems in combination with severe lacks of sufficient IT skills. This means that the most commonly used systems are the ones requiring the most of our time. Therefore, the move for the SME towards e-commerce and electronic processes has a significant economical potential for the SMEs. E-commerce and other internet based services will simplify their business, and hence allow the SMEs to focus on their core business which was their raison d'{\^e}tre. In addition to this can be added other fundamental IT systems that will help their business, but that is outside the scope of this paper. Furthermore, this paper focuses on infrastructural barriers and cloud computing; not only focusing on bandwidth, but also the entire issue of service offering. Services offered via cloud computing solutions will minimize the SMEs investment in own hardware (HW), software (SW) and maintenance. The focus is also the upgrade to a superior infrastructure that provides the platform for efficient cloud computing, for e-commerce, and beyond.",

It is evident that smart cities should accommodate every citizen, most especially those who may struggle with accessing information through conventional mediums. Specifically, smart cities must ensure that full participation is available to those citizens with communication and learning disabilities and new immigrant populations who experience difficulties understanding the language of their new home county. The biggest challenge for these citizens is using the Internet for learning because of the need to read, view, or listen to content published online. Disabled students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses at colleges and universities are at a particular disadvantage since the use of empirical observation is critical in scientific learning and research. In this paper, we propose an intervention using a new software product and workflow for video captioning---a Universal Video Captioning platform (UVC). This platform provides a semi-automatic approach to synchronize the captioning into accessible STEM-related videos. It has the potential to transform learning and teaching for students with disabilities and those whose native language is not English by integrating synchronized captioned educational videos into undergraduate and graduate STEM disciplines. While accessing scientific content can pose unique challenges for disabled students and those who have just started learning a new language, the UVC platform has the potential to provide students with disabilities and recent immigrants the ability to pursue new and deeper learning opportunities.",

This issue has been attracting a growing interest, in particular because of the anxiety generated by the idea that digital technologies could cancel a large number of jobs. Although I agree with argument put forward in opposition to the existence of a causal link between technological innovation and increased productivity at the macroeconomic level, I believe that the novelty and pervasiveness of digital technologies require more in-depth micro-level analysis in order to understand the extent to which new digital technologies are currently employed by leading manufacturing companies and the ways new technologies are affecting employment. The empirical findings show that among the different technologies included under the umbrella of Industry 4.0, mainly robots have received a great deal of attention so far, while the current application and employment impact for other emerging technological opportunities such as 3D printing, Internet of Things, Augmented reality, Big data Analytics have not been studied yet.

With computation at user-end, it provides a fog-based computing paradigm to generate time senstive results, which along with cloud storage presents a comprehensive Fog-Cloud computing paradigm. Because of these reasons, the work presented in this paper focuses on utilizing the potential of IoT Technology to provide a novel Fog-Cloud architecture for efficient healthcare services in smart office. Specifically, a Fog-Cloud architecture has been proposed to monitor and analyze various health attributes of a person during his working hours. Moreover, the framework indulges various activities in the ambient office environment with the purpose of analyzing it for health severity. In order to realize this, a probabilistic measure, named as Severity Index (SI) is defined to evaluate the adverse effects of different activities on personal health. Finally, an application scenario of temporal healthcare predictive monitoring and alert generation is discussed to depict the ideology of Smart Office Healthcare. In order to validate the system, an experimental implmentation is performed on heterogenous datasets. The results obtained in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed model is highly efficient and accurate for providing appropriate healthcare environment during working hours of a person in a smart office.",

abstract="There is increased interest in deploying big data technology in the healthcare industry to manage massive collections of heterogeneous health datasets such as electronic health records and sensor data, which are increasing in volume and variety due to the commoditization of digital devices such as mobile phones and wireless sensors. The modern healthcare system requires an overhaul of traditional healthcare software/hardware paradigms, which are ill-equipped to cope with the volume and diversity of the modern health data and must be augmented with new ``big data'' computing and analysis capabilities. For researchers, there is an opportunity in healthcare data analytics to study this vast amount of data, find patterns and trends within data and provide a solution for improving healthcare, thereby reducing costs, democratizing health access, and saving valuable human lives. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of different big data analytics integrated healthcare systems and describe the various applicable healthcare data analytics algorithms, techniques, and tools that may be deployed in wireless, cloud, Internet of Things settings. Finally, the contribution is given in formation of a convergence point of all these platforms in form of SmartHealth that could result in contributing to unified standard learning healthcare system for future.",

abstract="A combination of big data and predictive analytics orchestrated through the Internet of Things (IoT) offers many opportunities for researchers in Information Systems, Operations Management and Strategy to look at old problems in new ways, and to identify completely new research areas. While there is much hype, little research has been conducted that informs companies about how to profitably integrate the IoT with strategic or operational processes. This paper views the IoT through the lens of predictive maintenance -- the use of real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to dynamically manage preventive maintenance policies. These are being used by numerous manufacturing organizations to transition from product-oriented to service-oriented business models. In particular, we analyze optimal preventive maintenance policies in an environment where equipment is subject to a deterioration, which shifts it from its initial, fully-productive state, having a specified, age-dependent failure rate to a less-productive or deteriorated state, having a different, presumably higher, age-dependent failure rate. The deterioration, itself, is a random process.",

In order for IoT to take off in the IT sector, providers and other stakeholders must integrate knowledge successfully. In this study, we investigate the role of social media in supporting knowledge integration from a social capital perspective. Specifically, we propose that social media have the potential to facilitate the formation of employees' social capital indicated by social networking, trust and shared language. These mediating variables will in turn positively affect knowledge integration. This research frame is validated with survey data collected from 262 Chinese working professionals. The results provide general empirical support for our hypotheses. In analogy with social media for human beings, the future direction of socialization among objects can be inspired by this study.",

abstract="The Internet of things (IoT) is composed of a large number of end systems. Data gathered from these end systems are processed in the cloud environment. This paper delineates multi-tenancy as a prerequisite for enabling cost effective IoT solutions using any cloud platform. In the IoT world, a large number of end systems imply a large number of users who should have open access to specific subsets of data. As multi-tenancy includes sharing the same application instance, security is a key requirement when engineering new software as a service (SaaS) applications. This paper describes multi-tenant implementation approaches and inspects security aspects and data isolation. It proposes a solution for data layer scalability in order to achieve the desired performances. Furthermore, it proposes an SOA solution to provide a secure multi-tenant web service with scalable data layers. We demonstrate that the proposed approach results in some performance loss, which is not acceptable for performance critical applications but is acceptable for services developed for tenants themselves. We experimentally confirm our data scalability theory based on an actor model and developed a cost estimator. Finally, we conclude that application level multi-tenancy is necessary from a cost efficiency point of view in a scenario involving a large number of users. The solution was tested in a private cloud environment.",

abstract="Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the European economy. A critical challenge faced by SME leaders, as a consequence of the continuing digital technology revolution, is how to optimally align business strategy with digital technology to fully leverage the potential offered by these technologies in pursuit of longevity and growth. There is a paucity of empirical research examining how e-leadership in SMEs drives successful alignment between business strategy and digital technology fostering longevity and growth. To address this gap, in this paper we develop an empirically derived e-leadership model. Initially we develop a theoretical model of e-leadership drawing on strategic alignment theory. This provides a theoretical foundation on how SMEs can harness digital technology in support of their business strategy enabling sustainable growth. An in-depth empirical study was undertaken interviewing 42 successful European SME leaders to validate, advance and substantiate our theoretically driven model. The outcome of the two stage process -- inductive development of a theoretically driven e-leadership model and deductive advancement to develop a complete model through in-depth interviews with successful European SME leaders -- is an e-leadership model with specific constructs fostering effective strategic alignment. The resulting diagnostic model enables SME decision makers to exercise effective e-leadership by creating productive alignment between business strategy and digital technology improving longevity and growth prospects.",

abstract="Contemporary data practices are inducing a convergent saturation point (conceptually referred to as Total Data) wherein every human action, reaction, interaction, transaction, thought or desire is quantified, reified, recorded and used. Physical or virtual, all is recorded, known or unknown, seen or unseen, until data permeates every facet of our shared human existence. The implications of this eventuality are potentially so far reaching that the very notion or concept of who we are might be fundamentally altered, resulting in new ontologies of the self in a world of Total Data. This polemic paper reflects on the implications that Total Data has for the ontological self in a range of individual and shared contexts, and considers the potential it has to ultimately be symbiotic or assimilatory. It suggests that the current trajectory for Total Data is more assimilatory than symbiotic, demonstrating more potential to collectively monitor and control people than to emancipate and empower them. In response, it calls for an authentic debate and reassessment of current data practices, and for an urgent reprioritisation of core and enduring human-centred values and symbiosis in technological systems development to emancipate and empower people living in a Total Data world.",

Once a communication schedule is built, the IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is able to execute such a communication schedule. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH standard lea ves out of scope defining how that communication schedule is built, updated and maintained. In order to fill this gap, we introduce such a scheduling algorithm, called as DIVA. DIVA is specifically designed for IEEE 8092.15.4e TSCH networks. It is a totally distributed scheduling algorithm for divergecast traffic where divergecast means that traffic flows in all directions in contrast to convergecast where traffic flows from leave nodes to root. In order to gain more comprehension about DIVA, we conducted extensive simulations. We also compared DIVA with Berkeley's Aloha-based algorithm.",

IoTs are merged with Cloud Computing technology in Multi-Cloud form that basically helps cover the limitations of IoTs by offering a secure and on-demand shared pool of resources i.e., networks, servers, storage, applications, etc., to deliver effective and well-organized e-health amenities. Although the framework based on the integration of IoT and Multi-Cloud is contributing towards better patient care, yet on the contrary, it is challenging the privacy and reliability of the patients' information.

Cloud integration with IoT made things more convenient and easy. Clock synchronization between systems in a distributed network is the complex and tedious job. It is mandatory to get sync with other and source as well. There are many proposed ways of data synchronization protocols like NTP, global position system to maintain sync process between Systems or IoT devices network. In this paper, we are proposing a clock synchronization approach to sync clocks between IoTs and Cloud which are connected with each other in distributed network. Here we have used cloud service Software as a Service to collect the information to analysis and trigger the results action to IoTs. In this paper, we present the Clock Synchronization based on precision time protocol between IoTs simulation model for Omnet++ with INET framework, which allows us to check clock sync accuracy with a different network configured topologies. We have tried to minimize the clock drift with clock offset updating and with master--slave phenomena also minimize the master--slave delay. To show our simulation results we have used chunks nodes of IoTs in distributed manner placed in different places with different clock values. The simulation result shows that proposed approach works in the desired manner within ideal and network delay symmetry.",

The physical layer connections are realized by device-to-device spectrum sharing techniques, and we accordingly designed a cooperative multicast service case to make full use of the wireless broadcasting nature.

abstract="An emergency response system (ERS) can assist a municipality or government in improving its capabilities to respond urgent and severe events. The responsiveness and effectiveness of an ERS relies greatly on its data acquisition and processing system, which has been evolved with information technology (IT). With the rapid development of sensor networks and cloud computing, the emerging Internet of things (IoT) tends to play an increasing role in ERSs; the networks of sensors, public services, and experts are able to interact with each other and make scientific decisions to the emergencies based on real-time data. When group decision making is required in an ERS, one critical challenge is to obtain the good understanding of massive and diversified data and make consensus group decisions under a high-level stress and strict time constraint. Due to the nature of unorganized data and system complexity, an ERS depends on the perceptions and judgments of experts from different domains; it is challenging to assess the consensus of understanding on the collected data and response plans before appropriate decisions can be reached for emergencies. In this paper, the group decision-making to emergency situations is formulated as a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem, the consensus among experts is modeled, and a new methodology is proposed to reach the understanding of emergency response plans with the maximized consensus in course of decision-making. In the implementation, the proposed methodology in integrated with computer programs and encapsulated as a service on the server. The objectives of the new methodology are (i) to enhance the comprehensive group cognizance on emergent scenarios and response plans and (ii) to accelerate the consensus for decision making with an intelligent clustering algorithm, (iii) to adjust the experts' opinions without affecting the reliability of the decision when the consensus cannot be reached from the preliminary decision-making steps. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) has been applied as the clustering algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is deployed to adjust evaluation values automatically. The methodology is applied in a case study to illustrate its effectiveness in converging group opinions and promoting the consensus of understanding on emergencies.",

abstract="With the exponential growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, security and privacy issues have emerged as critical challenges that can potentially compromise their successful deployment in many data-sensitive applications. Hence, there is a pressing need to address these challenges, given that IoT systems suffer from different limitations, and IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy and computational power, which renders them extremely vulnerable to attacks. Traditional cryptographic algorithms use a static structure that requires several rounds of computations, which leads to significant overhead in terms of execution time and computational resources. Moreover, the problem is compounded when dealing with multimedia contents, since the associated algorithms have stringent QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose a lightweight cipher algorithm based on a dynamic structure with a single round that consists of simple operations, and that targets multimedia IoT. In this algorithm, a dynamic key is generated and then used to build two robust substitution tables, a dynamic permutation table, and two pseudo-random matrices. This dynamic cipher structure minimizes the number of rounds to a single one, while maintaining a high level of randomness and security. Moreover, the proposed cipher scheme is flexible as the dimensions of the input matrix can be selected to match the devices' memory capacity. Extensive security tests demonstrated the robustness of the cipher against various kinds of attacks. The speed, simplicity and high-security level, in addition to low error propagation, make of this approach a good encryption candidate for multimedia IoT devices.",

Recently, the evidence theory and its derivates approaches began to take place in the fields of activity recognition in these smart systems. However, these approaches are generally inconsistent with the probability calculus due to the lower and upper probability bounds considering the combined evidences. To overcome these challenges and to get more precisely the reconcilement between the evidence theory with the frequentist approach of probability calculus, this work proposes a new methodology for combining beliefs, addressing some of the disadvantages exhibited by the evidence theory and its derivatives. This methodology merges the non-normalized conjunctive and the majority rules. The proposed rule is evaluated in numerical simulation case studies involving the activity recognition in a smart home environment. The results show that this strategy produces intuitive results in favor of the more committed hypothesis.",

One of the main elements to succeed any service oriented approach is a proficient service discovery protocol. In this paper, we propose EADP: an efficient protocol to announce and discover services in 6LoWPAN networks. EADP adopts a fully distributed approach using an adaptive push--pull model to ensure fast discovery times, low energy consumption and low generated overhead with timely reaction to network dynamics. EADP achieves this by using context-awareness information, delivered by a trickle algorithm. EADP was implemented and evaluated in Contiki using the Cooja simulator.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a new paradigm of the future internet that intends to provide interactive communication between various processing object via heterogeneous networks. The routing protocol in the IoT environment is Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The current RPL specification defines primary security modes; therefore it is vulnerable to topological attacks. In this paper the RPL routing mechanism, its topological vulnerabilities and two important topological attacks namely version number attack and rank spoofing attack are analyzed. To counter the mentioned attacks, a lightweight Identity Based Offline--Online Signature based scheme is proposed. Our evaluation shows that our proposed scheme is secure in the random oracle model, and in terms of computational cost and energy consumption efficiently counters with these attacks.",

In Qualnet7.2, with the help of three types of energy model generic, mica z and mica motes the energy consumption in three modes transmit, receive and sleep mode is analysed, where it is seen that energy consumption in sleep mode is much less than in any other modes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm where it is shown that the energy consumption in sleep mode is less than in any other modes.",

Physical distance is no more a barrier in online social networks, but cultural differences (at the individual, community, as well as societal levels) still govern human-human interactions and must be considered and leveraged in the online world. The rapid deployment of high-speed Internet allows humans to interact using a rich set of multimedia data such as texts, pictures, and videos. This position paper proposes to define a new research area called `connected multimedia', which is the study of a collection of research issues of the super-area social media that receive little attention in the literature. By connected multimedia, we mean the study of the social and technical interactions among users, multimedia data, and devices across cultures and explicitly exploiting the cultural differences. We justify why it is necessary to bring attention to this new research area and what benefits of this new research area may bring to the broader scientific research community and the humanity.",

abstract="In this work, we discuss a novel mechanical resonator design for the realisation of vibration Energy Harvester (EH) capable to deliver power levels in the mW range. The device overcomes the typical constraint of frequency narrowband operability of standard cantilevered EHs, by exploiting a circular-shaped resonator with an increased number of mechanical Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs), leading to several resonant modes in the range of vibrations of interest (i.e. multi-modal wideband EH). The device, named Four-Leaf Clover (FLC), is simulated in Ansys Workbench{\texttrademark}, showing a significant number of resonant modes up to vibrations of around 2 kHz (modal eigenfrequencies analysis), and exhibiting levels of converted power up to a few mW at resonance (harmonic coupled-field analysis). The FLC mechanical structure, along with cantilevered test structure, is realised by micro-milling of an Aluminium foil. PolyVinyliDene Fluoride (PVDF) film sheet pads are assembled in order to collect first experimental feedback on generated power levels. The FLC and cantilevered EH test structures are characterised experimentally with a measurement setup purposely developed, showing encouraging performance related to the technology chosen for the realisation of EH, thus paving the way for full validation of the macro-FLC concept.",

The multimedia-based IoT-centric environment is suitable to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of learning contents. Students can take full advantage of 7As of IoT, which provides the opportunity to the students that they can access everything on the internet at any time and place. It creates a flexible eLearning paradigm for the teachers and students. The proposed eLearning modeluses sensors to detect the student location, temperature, and mobile camera to identify the student activeness in thelearning environment. Virtual campuses are controlled from a centralized location that may be called the head office. The MAQAS framework provides the solutions to the problems and analyzes the results for the efficient and connected eLearning paradigm. The MAQAS system is used to answer student's queries, which are responded to automatically by agent-based question answering system.

abstract="In recent years, RFID (radio-frequency identification) systems are widely used in many applications. One of the most important applications for this technology is the Internet of things (IoT). Therefore, researchers have proposed several authentication protocols that can be employed in RFID-based IoT systems, and they have claimed that their protocols can satisfy all security requirements of these systems. However, in RFID-based IoT systems we have mobile readers that can be compromised by the adversary. Due to this attack, the adversary can compromise a legitimate reader and obtain its secrets. So, the protocol designers must consider the security of their proposals even in the reader compromised scenario. In this paper, we consider the security of the ultra-lightweight RFID mutual authentication (ULRMAPC) protocol recently proposed by Fan et al. They claimed that their protocol could be applied in the IoT systems and provide strong security. However, in this paper we show that their protocol is vulnerable to denial of service, reader and tag impersonation and de-synchronization attacks. To provide a solution, we present a new authentication protocol, which is more secure than the ULRMAPC protocol and also can be employed in RFID-based IoT systems.",

abstract="In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been introduced to offer promising solutions in many areas. A big challenge faced by the IoT is to integrate heterogeneous information sources and process information effectively. As an important element in information integration, temporal reasoning is highly related to the dynamic, sequential aspect of both the information integration and the decision making process. Focusing on temporal reasoning, this paper introduces a method to represent both qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints in a 2-dimensional (2-D) space. Meanwhile, an efficient constraint-based geometric (CG) algorithm for propagating constraints (including inherent constraints and constraint pairs) on events in a 2-D space is proposed. A geometric recombination and intersection (GRI) method, a part of the CG algorithm, is presented to propagate one constraint pair from a geometric point. The experimental results show that in terms of both constructed and realistic benchmarks, the CG algorithm outperforms the existing Floyd-Warshall's algorithm with the time complexity of O(n                        3), especially for benchmarks with a large number of events.",

In this paper, we propose to use an artificial intelligence method, case-based reasoning (CBR), to develop a multi-level employee turnover risk evaluation model. The proposed model adopts multiple CBR techniques including case representation, organization and management, and retrieval and matching to evaluate employee turnover risk. Specifically, we employ an object-oriented method in case knowledge expressing, utilize relational database in case organization and management, and follow a tree-hash algorithm to retrieve the best cases.

abstract="The technology of IoT combined with medical systems is expected to support advanced medical services. However, unsolved security problems, such as misuse of medical devices, illegal access to the medical server and so on, make IoT-based medical systems not be applied widely. In addition, users have a high burden of computation to access Things for the explosive growth of IoT devices. Because medical information is critical and important, but users have a restricted computing power, IoT-based medical systems are required to provide secure and efficient authentication for users. In this paper, we propose a selective group authentication scheme using Shamir's threshold technique. The property of selectivity gives the right of choice to users to form a group which consists of things users select and access. And users can get an access authority for those Things at a time. Thus, our scheme provides an efficient user authentication for multiple Things and conditional access authority for safe IoT-based medical information system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first in which selectivity is combined with group authentication in IoT environments.",

Focus is on deploying cognitive radio technologies (5G) which enables the smart city networks to support interconnected infrastructure elements, to handle big-data from the smart homes, and to be compatible with existing infrastructures. The considered cognitive radio technology is based on pre-coded OFDM which offers the needed flexibility to deal with the key challenges found in the smart home networks. Thus, it is able to overcome the WiFi interferences and the wall penetration losses for a limited power cost. By simulation it has been found that power saving in the range of 10--23 {\%} can be achieved for a small bandwidth cost. Additionally, it has been found that the choice of the smart home gateway location can change its power consumption with 99 {\%}. The developed simulator incorporates interferences, wall losses, and packet error rates, which is elaborated in this paper.",

Currently, WSNs are expected to be integrated into the internet of things (IoT), where sensor nodes join the internet dynamically and collaborate to accomplish their tasks. In the application of the IoT, WSNs can play an important role by collecting surrounding contextual and environmental information. However, ensuring a stable and reliable topology is an important issue with regard to WSNs. To cope with the influence of faulty components, it is essential to reach a common agreement in the presence of faults, before performing certain tasks. However, the Byzantine agreement (BA) problem is a fundamental issue in fault-tolerant distributed systems. To enhance the fault tolerance and reliability of the WSN, the BA problem in the cluster-based WSN (CWSN) is revisited in this study. The proposed protocol can achieve agreement on a common value among all functional nodes in a minimal number of message exchange rounds, and can tolerate a maximal number of allowable faulty components in the CWSN.",

As the new generation of industrial devices coming to the shop floors features greatly improved storage, computing and networking capabilities, the factory of the future transforms itself to a system of systems, where of large numbers of heterogeneous networked embedded devices dynamically exchange information, complement each other's functionality and provide new innovative capabilities that satisfy the emergent dynamic business requirements. This new breed of networked embedded devices goes beyond simple passive roles, e.g. being able to store and report information about themselves and their physical surroundings once queried, but execute complex computations and global logic locally, as well as dynamically adapt to fulfil goal-driven conditions. They communicate in an open interoperable way, form cooperative peer-to-peer networks and strongly interact with enterprise systems. This leads to highly modular, manageable and dynamic factories that will be able to adapt and optimize their behaviour to achieve the business goals pursued in a cross-layer collaborative way.",

abstract="Cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent a new class of information system that also takes real-world data and effects into account. Software-controlled sensors, actuators and smart objects enable a close coupling of the cyber and physical worlds. Introducing processes into CPS to automate repetitive tasks promises advantages regarding resource utilization and flexibility of control systems for smart spaces. However, process execution systems face new challenges when being adapted for process execution in CPS: the automated processing of sensor events and data, the dynamic invocation of services, the integration of human interaction, and the synchronization of the cyber and physical worlds. Current workflow engines fulfill these requirements only to a certain degree. In this work, we present PROtEUS---an integrated system for process execution in CPS. PROtEUS integrates components for event processing, data routing, dynamic service selection and human interaction on the modeling and execution level. It is the basis for executing self-healing model-based workflows in CPS. We demonstrate the applicability of PROtEUS within two case studies from the Smart Home domain and discuss its feasibility for introducing workflows into cyber-physical systems.",

abstract="Nowadays, thanks to the hardware costs reduction everyone at home owns at least one hi-technology devices to support life quality. This paper proposes a new methodology to analyse the indoor air quality with a cheap and third-age-dedicated device. A new prototype, called Home Pollution Embedded System (HOPES), was developed to give simple and understandable information, also comprehensible for people with cognitive problems or that are not familiar with new technologies. The device gathers pollutants data and displays to the user different air pollutants concentrations, from toxics gasses up to explosives. Moreover, an overall air quality index has been elaborated and is displayed by HOPES with lights and numerical information. HOPES is an Internet of things device that works in real time and that can be connected to the web and to a geographic information system platform to add spatial information of each pollutant. The hardware architecture employs a set of gas semiconductor sensors and an IR particulate matter sensor. Experimental results demonstrated that HOPES has an accurate sensor response and is suitable to be used with the proposed indices. In fact, despite of the poor-selective metal oxide sensors, the results highlighted how it is possible to get useful air quality information with a cheap device. However, the system needs more tests to validate the sensors array with different substances.",

abstract="Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a popular topic and a dominant trend in various fields, such as healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation. In particular, in the field of education, it has become a popular tool to improve learners' interests and achievements by making them interact with various devices in and out of the classroom. Lessons in newspaper in education (NIE), which uses newspapers as an educational resource, have started to utilize it. For instance, by analyzing the data generated from a learner's device, such as Raspberry Pi, appropriate news and related multimedia data can be provided to the learners as learning materials to support the lesson. However, as news and multimedia data are scattered in a wide variety of forms, it is very difficult to select appropriate ones for the learner. In this paper, we propose a news and related multimedia recommendation scheme based on IoT for supporting NIE lessons. Specifically, news and related multimedia data are collected from the Web, and they are integrated and stored into the server. After that, the learner can easily browse such contents using a mobile device through personalized visualization, which increase the efficiency of NIE lessons. To show the effectiveness of our scheme, we implemented a prototype system and performed various experiments. We present some of the results.",

abstract="Ebola is a deadly infectious virus that spreads very quickly through human-to-human transmission and sometimes death. The continuous detection and remote monitoring of infected patients are required in order to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Healthcare services based on Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies are emerging as a more effective and proactive solution which provides remote continuous monitoring of patients. A novel architecture based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), wearable sensor technology, and cloud computing infrastructure is proposed for the detection and monitoring of Ebola infected patients. The aim of this work is to prevent the spreading of the infection at the early stage of the outbreak. The J48 decision tree is used to evaluate the level of infection in a user depending on his symptoms. RFID is used to automatically sense the close proximity interactions (CPIs) between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to describe and monitor the current state of the outbreak using the CPI data. The performance and accuracy of our proposed model are evaluated on Amazon EC2 cloud using synthetic data of two million users. Our proposed model provided 94 {\%} accuracy for the classification and 92 {\%} of the resource utilization.",

In this contribution, we take mirror worlds as a conceptual blueprint to envision future smart environments in which the physical and the virtual layers are blended into each other. We suggest that pervasive computing technologies can be used to create a coupling between these layers, so that actions or, more generally, events in the physical layer would have an effect in the virtual layer and viceversa. On top of this, wearable technologies and augmented reality techniques enable new forms of user interaction with the smart environment and with other users. Mirror worlds so conceived will enable temporal, individual, and social augmentations. We conclude by elaborating on some possible consequences at the societal level.",

abstract="This paper presents a systematic literature review of papers that were published in academic journals on the applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) in supply chain management between the years 2000 and 2015. As the literature on RFID is not confined to specific disciplines or repositories, this paper proposes a discipline-based framework for classifying RFID literature. Five main classification categories are used in this paper: technology, supply chain management, research methodology, application industries, and social aspects. The paper then focuses on the category of supply chain management and reviews 1187 articles that were published between 2000 and 2015 in rated journals. All the papers reviewed are further classified into eight subclasses under this category of supply chain management. The review yields useful insights into the anatomy of RFID literature in supply chain management, enhances evidence-based knowledge, and contributes to informing practice, policymaking and future research. The review reveals that even presently, despite technical and cost challenges, enormous potential exists for the application of RFID in several areas of supply chain management and the prospects are likely to grow into the future. Since RFID solutions have emerged primarily over only the past 20 years, significant research opportunities exist and would need to be addressed to continue to support the technology's maturation, evaluation, adoption, implementation, and diffusion.",

A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45{\%} research articles and 55{\%} manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3{\%}), skin cancer (36.3{\%}), prostate cancer (18.1{\%}), and multi-type cancer (9{\%}). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system.

abstract="Currently, Engineer-To-Order manufacturing companies are under high pressure from global competition and turbulent market excitations, resulting in increasing product variety, individualisation and shortened time frames. Additionally, manufacturing companies are faced with the increasing complexity of products, production structures and processes. It is obvious that manufacturing companies with structural rigidity, a deterministic approach to decision-making in a stochastic environment, hierarchical allocation of competencies and insufficient communication and exploitation of expertise cannot achieve these requirements at an appropriate level. This paper presents the conceptual framework for a ubiquitous autonomous work system in the Engineer-To-Order environment by applying ubiquitous computing technology and cloud computing to the manufacturing system. This approach aims to improve the performance of manufacturing systems by increasing their productivity, availability, responsiveness and agility as well as support to decision-making and real-time operations management. This paper is structured in two sections. The first section presents the derivation procedure for the u-AWS framework in the project-oriented Engineer-To-Order manufacturing. The second section describes a case study based on online diagnostics and prognostics for asset conditions. This study is conducted in a workshop of a manufacturing system in an Engineer-To-Order company to provide a demonstration of the concepts.",

However, security issues in communication sessions resulting from the leakage of personal medical information, infringements of privacy and improper management of medical information are looming large. Since personal medical information is transmitted between wire/wireless devices, the threats to secure distance medical service could be detrimental to further advancement of IoT in healthcare. Hence, this paper proposed a method of addressing the vulnerabilities to a range of attacks in the communication between medical devices.

Such an innovative technology can lead to positive changes in human life. However, if there is no proper security mechanism, private and sensitive data around humans can be revealed to the public Internet. In this aspect, this paper considers security issues of the IoT. In particular, we focus on various challenges in deploying Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol into a resource constrained environment. DTLS provides secure communication with UDP-based applications the same as TLS does for TCP-based applications. Several standard organizations such as IETF, oneM2M and OMA recommend using the DTLS as a default secure scheme for CoAP which is a new standard specified for resource-constrained environments. To find a practical way to deploy the DTLS in such a constrained IoT environments, we propose an IoT--Cloud collaboration system, where DTLS handshake delegation is the main component. We also implement and evaluate the proposed system in our real IoT testbed, where constrained devices are interconnected with each other in a multi-hop fashion. Evaluation results show that the proposed scheme dramatically reduces DTLS handshake latency, implementation code size and energy consumption.",

The analysis was visualized using tools for big data and text mining to understand the dominant themes and how they are connected. Subsequently, an industry-specific categorization of the studies was done to understand the key use cases. It was found that most of the existing research focuses majorly on consumer discretionary, followed by public administration. Methodologically, a major focus in such exploration is in social media analytics, text mining and machine learning applications for meeting objectives in marketing and supply chain management. However, it was found that not much focus was highlighted in these studies to demonstrate the tools used for the analysis. To address this gap, this study also discusses the evolution, types and usage of big data tools. The brief overview of big data technologies grouped by the services they enable and some of their applications are presented. The study categorizes these tools into big data analysis platforms, databases and data warehouses, programming languages, search tools, and data aggregation and transfer tools.

Recently, the associations between lack of sleep and weight gain, development of cancer and many other health problems have been recognized. Then monitoring the sleep and wake state all night is becoming a hotspot issue. Traditionally it classified by a PSG recording which is very costly and uncomfortable. Nowadays, with the advance of internet of things, many convenient wearable devices are being used for medical use, like measuring the heart rate (HR), blood pressure and other signals. With the sleep quality monitor problem, the key question is how to discriminate the sleep and weak stage from these signals. This paper proposed a Bayesian approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW) method for sleep and wake classification. It used HR and surplus pulse O2 (SPO2) signals to analyze the sleep states and the occurrence of some sleep-related problems. DTW is an algorithm that searches an optimal alignment between time series with scaling and shifting and Bayesian methods have been successfully used for object classification in many study. In this paper, a three-step process is used for sleep and wake classification. In the first step, the DTW is used to extract features of the original HR and SPO2 signals. Then a probabilistic model is introduced for using the Bayesian classification for uncertain data. And in the classification step, the DTW features are used as the training dataset in the Bayesian approach for sleep and wake classification. Finally, a case study form a real-word applications, collected from the website of the Sleep Heart Health Study, is presented to shown the feasibility and advantages of the DTW-based Bayesian approach.",

abstract="Big Data has become a very popular term. It refers to the enormous amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that are exponentially generated by high-performance applications in many domains: biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, physics, astronomy, business, to mention a few. Since the literature of Big Data has increased significantly in recent years, it becomes necessary to develop an overview of the state-of-the-art in Big Data. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of Big Data literature of the last 4 years, to identify the main challenges, areas of application, tools and emergent trends of Big Data. To meet this objective, we have analyzed and classified 457 papers concerning Big Data. This review gives relevant information to practitioners and researchers about the main trends in research and application of Big Data in different technical domains, as well as a reference overview of Big Data tools.",

Device convergence means that mobile devices become much more than a phone, they turn into a mobile computers. In radio convergence several standards are competing but wireless broadband is the end result and modem develops into a multiradio. From network convergence point of view different access technologies offer seamless connectivity and hide the network from end user with best possible performance. With service convergence mobile devices become true nodes of internet when devices are capable to act both as a client and a server.

abstract="Advancements in technology are radically transforming service, and increasingly providing the underlying basis for service strategy. In this paper, we develop a typology and positioning map for service strategy, in the context of rapid technological change, and outline the process for firms to position or reposition their service strategies. Which strategy to choose is based on the degree to which customer demand is heterogeneous, and the degree to which potential customer lifetime value varies across customers. This results in four strategies: the McService strategy that is standardized and transactional, the Relational Service strategy that is standardized and relational, the Customized Transaction strategy that is personalized and transactional, and the Adaptive Personalization strategy that is personalized and relational. We provide firms a roadmap for identifying a ``sweet spot'' strategy in relation to a segment's realized or potential customer lifetime value, combined with the firm's technological capabilities. Because technological capabilities inevitably advance, firms will tend to move from standardized to personalized and from transactional to relational over time, implying that firms should be alert to technological opportunities to personalize their relationships with customers. Our strategic framework also produces a useful bridge from marketing practice to the conceptual evolution of the service literature, showing how the historical trends toward continuing customer relationships and co-productive personalization should drive strategic thinking in service.",

Since IoT is always related to user's personal information, it raises lot of data security and privacy issues. In this paper, we present a secure and fine-grained data access control scheme for constrained IoT devices and cloud computing based on hierarchical attribute-based encryption, which reduces the key management by introducing hierarchical attribute authorities. In order to relieve local computation burden, we propose an outsourced encryption and decryption construction by delegating most of laborious operations to gateway and cloud server. Further, our scheme achieves efficient policy updating, which allows the sender device to update access policies without retrieving and re-encrypting the data. The security and performance analysis results show that our scheme is secure and efficient.",

The exposure of ICN to scenarios other than static content distribution is a growing research topic, promising to extend the impact of ICN to a broader scale. In this context, particular attention has been given to the application of ICN in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The current paper, by focusing on local domain IoT scenarios, such as multi-sensory Machine to Machine environments, discusses the challenges that ICN, particularly Interest-based solutions, impose to service discovery. This work proposes a service discovery mechanism for such scenarios, relying on an alternative forwarding pipeline for supporting its core operations. The proposed mechanism is validated through a proof-of-concept prototype, developed on top of the Named Data Networking ICN architecture, with results showcasing the benefits of our solution for discovering services within a collision domain.",

We discuss the need to re-examine our understanding of information technology and information system (IS) artefacts and to expand the range of the latter to include those artificial phenomena that are crucial to information security and privacy research. We then briefly discuss some prevalent limitations in theory, methodology, and contributions that generally weaken security/privacy studies and jeopardise their chances of publication in a top IS journal. More importantly, we suggest remedies for these weaknesses, identifying specific improvements that can be made and offering a couple of illustrations of such improvements. In particular, we address the notion of loose re-contextualisation, using deterrence theory research as an example. We also provide an illustration of how the focus on intentions may have resulted in an underuse of powerful theories in security and privacy research, because such theories explain more than just intentions. We then outline three promising opportunities for IS research that should be particularly compelling to security and privacy researchers: online platforms, the Internet of things, and big data. All of these carry innate information security and privacy risks and vulnerabilities that can be addressed only by researching each link of the systems chain, that is, technologies--policies--processes--people--society--economy--legislature. We conclude by suggesting several specific opportunities for new research in these areas.",

If IoT is enabled in the Smart Grid (SG), it can benefit from advantages of the IoT such as interoperability, connectivity, etc. By combining the IoT with energy harvesting (EH) and cognitive radio (CR) techniques, the problems of SG, such as harsh channel conditions and limited battery power, may be resolved. Hence, incorporation of EH and CR reveals a new networking paradigm for IoT-enabled SG. To this end, we first introduce CR usage in the IoT-enabled SG, and explain the advantages and challenges of CRs. Furthermore, we propose EH approaches for the resource constraint of wireless devices in the IoT-enabled SG. Operation and node architecture of energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CR), and network architecture of the IoT-enabled SG are described to explain details of our networking paradigm. Open issues and future research directions are discussed to enable this new paradigm.",

abstract="Datacollection and dissemination in wireless sensor networks (WSN) for Internet of Things (IoT) require stable multi-hop networking path from source to sink. However, due to the limited energy capacity, relay nodes that run out of battery may cause disconnected path and result in failure of end-to-end data transmission in WSN-based IoT. Therefore, besides saving energy in itself, each sensor involved in the multi-hop transmission activity also needs a feasible strategy to select the relay nodes by leveraging their residual energy and multi-hop IoT network connectivity. In this paper, we first analyze energy consumption model and data relay model in WSN-based IoT, and then propose the concept of ``equivalent node'' to select relay node for optimal data transmission and energy conservation. A probabilistic dissemination algorithm, called ENS{\_}PD, is designed to choose the optimal energy strategy and prolong the lifetime of whole network. Extensive simulation and real testbed results show that our models and algorithms can minimize energy consumption while guarantee the quality of communication in WSN-based IoT in comparison with other methods.",

We take these metrics and use case and systematically compare the two middleware platforms in the wild. We identify inefficiencies in implementations and characterize performance variations throughout the day, showing that the metrics may also be used for monitoring. Furthermore, we apply the same metrics and use case to two brokers set up in a controlled environment, providing infrastructure- and networking-independent insights.

abstract="In the last decades, it has been recognized that energy consumption in low power modes for electrical and electronic products is an important issue. There is a need to expand energy efficiency efforts beyond simple standby modes into the new more complex area of networks, thus tackling the new paradigm of living based on the Internet of Things. The European project SELINA carried out a large scale in store monitoring campaign, measuring about 6300 different equipment. Since then, there is no reference to other similar market surveillance studies being carried out in Europe. In Asia, a market surveillance campaign performed by the Asia Pacific Partnership with measurements on a regular basis has been very successful. SELINA results show that 18.5{\%} of the measured products present power values higher than the 2010 EC 1275/2008 regulation threshold in off-mode, and for standby this value reached 31{\%}. When a comparison is made with the 2013 EC 1275/2008 regulation threshold, these values increase twice. The Asia Pacific Partnership results alert policy makers that low passive standby does not guarantee low active standby. Several studies indicate that consumer electronic products are becoming more efficient and their energy consumption is decreasing. However, because the ownership of appliances is also increasing, these improvements in energy efficiency do not seem to have significant impact in the overall consumption of the households. In addition, there is evidence that not all appliances in the market reach the performance announced by the manufacturers. Recent measurements carried out by the Natural Resources Defense Council on flat screen TVs revealed that their real energy consumption seems to be higher than announced in the label. This shows the urgent need for measurement campaigns, since no market surveillance is being carried out on regular basis, and trusting the manufacturer's data seems to be unreliable.",

Damage and injury can and should be minimized through the provision of adequate situational awareness and decision-making support, and for this reason, the internet of things (IOT) is potentially very useful for managing crisis situations via providing sound disaster management and emergency-response information. This study has developed an IOT-based intelligent disaster information-integrated platform (IDIIP) for disaster monitoring, disaster information management, and emergency-response coordination. A radiation-monitoring scenario has been selected to prove the concept of the IDIIP. However, when numerous sensors and related devices are deployed, great difficulties arise in maintaining, updating, and configuring them. To address these issues, we developed a novel IOT-based data storage and exchange framework in IDIIP. Thanks to this framework, IOT devices can be upgraded effortlessly even if site conditions or users' requirements change. Our framework also makes it much easier to upgrade sensors without rewriting the sensor drivers. An experiment for radiation measurement was conducted to validate our prototype radiation-sensing node and IOT center node. This and an operational radiation-monitoring scenario for this platform are described in the article. All results indicate that this platform would be beneficial for radiation monitoring and disaster information dissemination to the public.",

abstract="Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) is a new and promising public key encryption that allows fine-grained authorization on data based on user attributes. Such property is favorable for multiple applications that require encrypted storage or access control on data, in particular: eHealth applications. However, ABE schemes are known not to be efficient in the encryption phase because ciphertext size and the time required to encrypt grow with the complexity of the access policy. Such drawback is critical in the context of pervasive computing, for instance, in the Internet of Things, where data producers are usually resource-constrained devices, e.g. smart phones or sensing platforms. In this work, we propose OEABE standing for Outsourcing mechanism for the Encryption of Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE). We show how a user can offload expensive operations of CP-ABE encryption to a semi-trusted party in a secure manner. Our proposed mechanism requires only one exponentiation on resource-constrained devices. We provide also an informal security analysis of possible attacks from a semi-honest adversary against the proposed solution. To demonstrate the performance gains of our mechanism, we first conducted a performance estimation on an emulated Wismote sensor platform. Then, we implemented our proposal and did comparison to an existing implementation of CP-ABE on a laptop.",

abstract="In an attempt to develop an understanding of existing research trends and to inform the development of new research in the field of telecommunications, literature reviews are being conducted. As an effort for investigating research trend, our research suggests the application of a text mining analysis technique to identify the knowledge structures of academic research in the field of telecommunications policy and to pinpoint future research opportunities. In this study, three analytical techniques were employed: a productivity analysis; a contents analysis based on topic modeling and word co-occurrence; and an author co-citation analysis based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, multidimensional scaling, and a factor analysis. The findings from the research productivity analysis imply that the journal `Telecommunications Policy' has greatly contributed to the publication of studies related to telecommunications policy. Moreover, our research institution analysis results indicate that telecommunication policy studies are undertaken by experts in various research fields. The contents and citation analysis results demonstrate that many studies related to telecommunications policy cover infrastructure-related topics, including the design, arrangement, and distribution of telecommunications networks. By contrast, recent studies are found to focus on the privacy and digital divide issues that may arise in connection with the application of telecommunications networks to other information technologies or industrial areas. However, the area of policy research that focuses on the application of information technologies still concentrates on the methods for the application of existing services---such as broadcasting and multimedia---without paying sufficient attention to the policy issues that may arise from the application of cloud computing, the Internet of Things, or big data analytics, services that have emerged with the recent expansion of wireless communications networks. In this sense, there is a need for discussions about the policies to respond to the increasing use of radio frequencies owing to the expansion of the Internet of Things, and to promote the efficient and safe control of data transmitted in real time on the wireless Internet. Studies of new technologies in the telecommunications policy field should be carried out in view of local and national characteristics. At the same time, further studies should consider efficient and reasonable ways to export telecommunications and networking technologies to countries that seek to invest in or expand their telecommunications networks to new information technologies. Expanding on this research, more text mining techniques for analyzing large amounts of text data and for clustering and visualizing them need to be considered.",

The NII (National Institute of Informatics) is Japan's primary academic research body in evolving social infrastructures. Wiener's vision of ``cybernetics'' and the objectives associated with the internationally almost forgotten term ``informatics'' may help in detecting the unifying ``ribbon'' around seemingly loosely coupled projects. While Wiener describes the conjunction of control and communication, where in a closed feedback loop the control logic is driven by physical measures, the NII extends this model to include humans, which expands the challenges of the control logic to the conjunction of cyberspace and physical processes. This may have social impacts as well as technical challenges, such as the ability to build a reverse interaction model. In addition, future development may lead to the emergence of unintended, unpredictable safety, reliability, and acceptance problems. ",

Failure performance datum of jib structure in service being collected, researched, and analyzed, the mechanical property, notch-crack and welding performance are backdated under characteristic parameters and typical service conditions to set up the failure modes database. Testing positions and points can be determined according to the database. The direct and indirect influence fuzzy relation matrixes between testing points or evaluation indexes are established by IDM to deduce influence matrixes and affected matrixes of every evaluation index, aiming at obtaining the centrality and reason degree being used to determine weighting factor of each index based upon making an analysis of the correlation and influence of the indexes. Accordingly, combined with FSET, the failure risk can be easily quantified.

Induction of smart gadgetries, people lifestyle equipped with wearables, and development of IoT has revitalized the feature scale of these applications. The landscape of health applications encountering big data need to be replotted on cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources of handheld devices. With this transformation, the outcome from certain health applications is significant where precise, user-centric, and personalized recommendations mimic like a personal care-giver round the clock. To maximize the services spectrum from these applications over cloud, certain challenges like data privacy and communication cost need serious attention. Following the existing trend together with an ambition to promote and assist users with healthy lifestyle we propose a framework of Health Fog where Fog computing is used as an intermediary layer between the cloud and end users. The design feature of Health Fog successfully reduces the extra communication cost that is usually found high in similar systems. For enhanced and flexible control of data privacy and security, we also introduce the cloud access security broker (CASB) as an integral component of Health Fog where certain polices can be implemented accordingly. The modular framework design of Health Fog is capable of engaging data from multiple resources together with adequate level of security and privacy using existing cryptographic primitives.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks are becoming the most popular technology as the paradigm of Internet of Things is emerging recently. Since IEEE 802.15.4, suitable for wireless sensor networks, has the prominent advantages such as the low cost and low energy consumption, it is helpful for variety fields that are sources of Internet of Things. They include healthcare monitoring, industrial application, smart grid, home automation, and many energy-critical application suffered from limited resources. In response, many studies have proposed energy efficient solutions, however, they may waste energy as ever. It is because they do not consider the contentions in multi-coordinator environments then the frequent packet collisions are followed by retransmission which consumed unnecessary energy. In this respect, we proposed a new and simply implementable contention mitigation scheme to enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes by reducing the contention degree among neighboring coordinators. In the proposed scheme, the coordinators recognize the network state by exchanging their information with each other. It leads that the coordinators isolate the superframe duration by staggering own beacon transmission. It can alleviate significant contentions among burst packets at the beginning of the superframe. Therefore, the proposed scheme reduces a lot of unnecessary wasted energy in the process of redundant retransmission. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing energy efficient solutions with regard to the network performance.",

abstract="In the context of the evolving Internet, a balance between technological advances and meaning change is crucial to develop innovative and breakthrough ``connected electronics'' that enable the Internet of Things. Designers and technologists are key enablers of this process respectively, ensuring adequate users' needs and technology development, inside the evolving context of social environment and human relations. Smart electronic product design must be a truly interdisciplinary process, in which technologists are aware of how much their decisions impact the user-product relationship and designers understand the full potential and associated limitations of technology involved. Shared knowledge and communication are essential in this scenario, but, due to their technological limitations, designers are often excluded from high-level decision processes. In this paper, we address the design of constructivist tools and associated strategy to enhance the technological literacy of designers, as a strong foundation for knowledge-based dialogue between these realms. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a long-term multidisciplinary Project-Based Learning application with Design and Electronics students. We present the cases from 2 years' experimentation (with the first year as control group) that demonstrate improvement in the quality of teamwork; in learning results; improved performance of the students reflected in the quality of the projects developed; and positive teachers' and students' evaluations. We conclude that the use of the proposed tool not only provides the designer an active voice in the process of designing smart electronics, but also promotes an effective common language between these two worlds.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks have been widely used in several applications ranging from environmental and health-care monitoring to military uses. Since sensor networks are typically deployed in hostile environments, broadcast authentication is a fundamental security service in wireless sensor networks. The slow signature verification in existing schemes always causes high energy consumption and long verification delay for broadcast authentication. In this paper, we study the secure and efficient ECC speeding up algorithms for fast authentication in wireless sensor networks. We propose two fast algorithms based on constrained triple base number system to improve the efficiency for situations with and without precomputations. These new algorithms combine the sparsity of constrained TBNS with Yao algorithm to reduce the cost of scalar multiplication. Several experiments have been conducted using Magma software to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms. Our experiments show that the two algorithms are more efficient than existing algorithms. Furthermore, the improvement of efficiency will reduce the energy consumption and thus prolong the network lifetime due to the decrease of computation overhead in signature verification.",

IoT Technology is not only capable of sensing the acute details of sensitive events from wider perspectives, but it also provides a means to deliver services in time sensitive and efficient manner. Henceforth, IoT Technology has been efficiently adopted in different fields of the healthcare domain. In this paper, a framework for IoT based patient monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is presented to enhance the deliverance of curative services. Though ICUs remained a center of attraction for high quality care among researchers, still number of studies have depicted the vulnerability to a patient's life during ICU stay. The work presented in this study addresses such concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of various events (and anomalies) with temporal associations, followed by time sensitive alert generation procedure. In order to validate the system, it was deployed in 3 ICU room facilities for 30 days in which nearly 81 patients were monitored during their ICU stay. The results obtained after implementation depicts that IoT equipped ICUs are more efficient in monitoring sensitive events as compared to manual monitoring and traditional Tele-ICU monitoring. Moreover, the adopted methodology for alert generation with information presentation further enhances the utility of the system.",

NFC enables ubiquitous and location- and context-aware computing. Interviews, on-site observation and a questionnaire were conducted to define situation awareness requirements and to assess both current user experiences and future scenarios of NFC-based information support for security service work. Results of the study show that information interaction challenges were related to non-value-adding information activities when trying maintain situation awareness. Challenges were related to disturbances in information flow between clients, security service back office and field. It was found that maintaining situation awareness in circuit guarding was more challenging than in local guarding. Future NFC functionalities providing information support in particular for maintenance of short-term situation awareness were assessed as promising.",

abstract="This paper describes concepts, design, implementation, and performance evaluation of a 3D-based user interface for accessing IoT-based Smart Environments (IoT-SE). The generic interaction model of the described work addresses some major challenges of Human-IoT-SE-Interaction such as cognitive overload associated with manual device selection in complex IoT-SE, loss of user control, missing system image or over-automation. To address these challenges we propose a 3D-based mobile interface for mixed-initiative interaction in IoT-SE. The 3D visualization and 3D UI, acting as the central feature of the system, create a logical link between physical devices and their virtual representation on the end user's mobile devices. By so doing, the user can easily identify a device within the environment based on its position, orientation, and form, and access the identified devices through the 3D interface for direct manipulation within the scene. This overcomes the problem of manual device selection. In addition, the 3D visualization provides a system image for the IoT-SE, which supports users in understanding the ambience and things going on in it. Furthermore, the mobile interface allows users to control the amount and the way the IoT-SE automates the environment. For example, users can stop or postpone system triggered automatic actions, if they don't like or want them. Users also can remove a rule forever. By so doing, users can delete smart behaviors of their IoT-SE. This helps to overcome the automation challenges. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of the proposed interaction system. We chose smart meeting rooms as the context for prototyping and evaluating our interaction concepts. However, the presented concepts and methods are generic and could be adapted to similar environments such as smart homes. We conducted a subjective usability evaluation (ISO-Norm 9241/110) with 16 users. All in one the study results indicate that the proposed 3D-User Interface achieved a good high score according to the ISO-Norm scores.",

abstract="Special attention needs to be paid to particulate matters and ultraviolet rays since they may cause diseases such as respiratory ailment and skin troubles when the exposure level is excessive. To reduce damages by environmental elements in Korea, the Korean Meteorological Agency provides environmental information real-time. However currently environmental information services are based on the administrative districts, there is a limitation in providing information on particulate matters and ultraviolet rays in the neighborhood efficiently. Besides, particulate matters or UV dosimeters that were released recently are operated individually and thus it is difficult to measure various environmental elements simultaneously. This study proposes a neighborhood particulate matters and ultraviolet rays warning system that utilizes a P2P-based open IoT platform in order to provide users with information on harmful environmental elements efficiently. The proposed system establishes an open IoT platform that manages collectively IoT smart devices capable of measuring particulate matters and ultraviolet rays, the measured data, and RSS data provided by administrative institutes. In addition, this system provides alerts based on the level of particulate matters and ultraviolet rays in utilization of a smart-phone application that provides environmental information, contributing to maintaining users' healthy life patterns.",

abstract="The ability to track and trace individual items, especially through large-scale and distributed networks, is the key to realizing many important business applications such as supply chain management, asset tracking, and counterfeit detection. Networked RFID (radio frequency identification), which uses the Internet to connect otherwise isolated RFID systems and software, is an emerging technology to support traceability applications. Despite its promising benefits, there remain many challenges to be overcome before these benefits can be realized. One significant challenge centers around dealing with uncertainty of raw RFID data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to effectively manage the uncertainty of RFID data in large scale traceability networks. The framework consists of a global object tracking model and a local RFID data cleaning model. In particular, we propose a Markov-based model for tracking objects globally and a particle filter based approach for processing noisy, low-level RFID data locally. Our implementation validates the proposed approach and the experimental results show its effectiveness.",

A widespread network of human-centric smartphone devices and PCs has been used as a valuable source of data collected and processed in order to trigger adequate actions upon problem resolving. In this way, humans acting as sensor operators and data sources become a powerful factor in improving their society. The Be Responsible platform enables the people to report the irregularities in various aspects of their social life (grey economy, misuse of government vehicles, ecology, traffic), and hence to take active part in resolving them. It also promotes positive and responsible social and institutional behavior, which has to be nurtured in any society seeking progress. The number of submitted reports as well as the money collected from the fine revenues and subsequently invested in projects of social good, undoubtedly prove that what could not be achieved through years of traditional government-led policy approach, was achieved in months of citizen engagement.",

Alzheimer disease affected more on the people who are in the age group of 80-year-90. The foot movement monitoring system is used to detect the early stage of Alzheimer disease. internets of things (IoT) devices are used in this paper to monitor the patients' foot movement in continuous manner. This paper uses dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to compare the various shapes of foot movements collected from the wearable IoT devices. The foot movements of the normal individuals and people who are affected by Alzheimer disease are compared with the help of middle level cross identification (MidCross) function. The identified cross levels are used to classify the gait signal for Alzheimer disease diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are calculated to evaluate the DTW algorithm based classification model for Alzheimer disease. The classification results generated using the DTW is compared with the various classification algorithms such as inertial navigation algorithm, K-nearest neighbor classifier and support vector machines. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the DTW method.",

Hopes of ongoing progress, economic growth, skill upgrading and possibly also democratisation are attached to new ICTs as well as fears of totalitarian control, alienation, job loss and insecurity. Currently, with the terms ``Industry 4.0.'' and `Fourth Industrial Revolution'' (FIR), public institutions (such as the national governments of Germany, Us, Italy, France, and Hollande), private institutions (the World Economic Forum, Hedge Funds, commercial banks), and literature refer to the inchoate transformation of production of goods and services resulting from the application of a new wave of technological innovations: interconnected collaborative robots; machine learning; Artificial Intelligence; 3D printers connected to digital development software; simulation of interconnected machines; integration of the information flow along the value chain; multidirectional communication between manufacturing processes and products (Internet of Things). According to the main representations of Industry 4.0. by private and public institutions, its effects are expected to be mainly positive, for what regards productivity, economic opportunities and the future of work. The positive potentials now attributed to the new cycle of innovation evoke and expand those attributed to the previous waves of innovation linked to ITC technologies, and, even before, to the transition from Fordism to Post-Fordism. However, these transformations have so far not achieved any of the promises they raised. Improvements for workers in terms of work conditions, work performance and work relationships cannot be determined by any technical innovation in itself, being technological innovation always socially shaped.",

It is interesting to outline the timeliness and highly predicting power of these statements. In particular, we would like to point to the relevance of the question ``What will the earth's new skin permit us to feel?'' to the work we are going to discuss in this paper.

In tourism as an ``information business'', Information Technology has always played an important role since the 1960s with the computerized reservation systems/global distribution systems; these were one of the first world-wide electronic networks. And since the beginning of the Web in the early 1990s, travel and tourism was and is a major application domain for Web-based services. As such, the domain is also a major driver of technological innovation. This manifesto provides guidelines on strategic research issues for the research community, but as such it is also conceived as a basis document for industry and policy makers.",

abstract="Solar greenhouses are well-established and very popular in the north of China as a way of meeting the demand for fresh local winter vegetables. Nonetheless, they are more susceptible to meteorological disasters, such as fog, haze and cold temperatures. A meteorological risk management system that includes disaster forecasting and control is a useful tool to efficiently capture long-term and up-to-the-minute environmental fluctuations inside greenhouses. Based on the concept of the meteorological disaster warning model, this study has developed a meteorological risk management system built upon a browser/server framework and mobile internet to provide precision agriculture (PA) services with large-scale, long-term, scalable and real-time data collection capabilities for solar greenhouse vegetables. Early warning indicators were established for the main meteorological hazards to winter-spring vegetables in solar greenhouses, including low temperature and sparse sunlight, downy mildew, grey mildew and powdery mildew induced by unfavorable meteorological conditions. The system could provide a valuable framework for farmers and agrometeorological officials in analyzing the relationships between vegetable damage dynamics and meteorological events. Having been applied in Beijing and Tianjin, the system has correctly forecast meteorological disaster and diseases caused by long-term fog and haze from November 2015. Based on the analysis carried out, improved meteorological risk management and a more accurate decision-making strategy can be developed to assist PA in combating meteorological disaster.",

The relationships summarized in CEB-FIP Model Code 1990 and Eurocode 2 are used in this study together with the numerical analysis result of a linear slip distribution along the interface at the stabilized cracking stage. With these, the actual strains of the steel and the concrete are integrated respectively along the embedment length between the adjacent cracks to obtain the difference in the axial elongation. This model is applied to the test results available in literature. The predicted values are shown to be in agreement with the experimentally measured data.",

This algorithm is combined with the artificial neural network and Bayesian algorithm according to the practical applications of the drug control system of the Internet of Things. The algorithm is divided into two parts: first, the artificial neural network algorithm is used to estimate the data of WSNs, the results are the reference for the conversion of routing node frequency; second, by using the Bayesian formula, valuation method, and the CSMA/CA's collision detection mechanism, the algorithm adjusts the frequency of the routing node and the relevant node frequency to establish the normal communication of packets sent by nodes and the aggregation node packets. In this way, it will reduce the collision detection and the back off time and avoid data packet duplication. The simulation tool-NS2 is used to configure an appropriate simulation scene for the experiment, which analyses and compares the received packet rate, the overall energy consumption of the network, and so on. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm ensures high energy efficiency and balanced energy consumption. Therefore the results show that the improved algorithm increases the efficiency, so that the network has the function of intelligent learning.",

abstract="Current Internet of Things (IoT) development requires service distribution over Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSAN) to deal with the drastic increasing of network management complexity. Because of the specific constraints of WSAN, some limitations can be observed in centralized approaches. Multi-hop communication used by WSAN introduces transmission latency, packet errors, router congestion and security issues. As it uses local services, a model of decentralized services avoids long path communications between nodes and applications. But the two main issues are then to design (1) the composition of such services and to map (2) them over the WSAN. This contribution proposes a model for decentralized services based on Resource Oriented Architecture in which their communications are designed thanks to an adaptation of Petri Network (1). In addition, the problem of decentralized service mapping and its deployment over a WSAN is successfully resumed by a Pseudo-Boolean Optimization in order to minimize network communication load (2). These contributions are presented using a proposed EMMA middleware as unifying thread.",

abstract="Internet of Things is a paradigm that enables communication between different devices connected to a local network or to Internet. Identification and communication between sensors used in Internet of Things and devices like smart-phones or tablets are established using radio frequency identification technology. However, this technology still has several security and privacy issues because of its severe computational constraints. In 2011, Jeong and Anh proposed the combined use of an authentication radio frequency identification protocol together with a ticket issuing system for bank services (in J. Supercomput. 55:307, 2011). In this paper we show that their message generation is weak, because it abuses the XOR operation and the use of a counter, which leaks too much secret protocol information. Our analysis shows important security faults that ruin most of the security properties claimed in the original paper. More precisely, information privacy (via a disclosure and leakage attack) and location privacy (traceability attack) are both compromised. Moreover, an attacker can disrupt the proper working of the system by exploiting the fact that message integrity is not properly checked.",

abstract="The Internet of Thing (IoT) is evolving into the Internet of Everything (IoE). Combining cloud computing with the IoE has attracted attention for wide area applications as a major service. In addition, low power wide area networks (LPWANs) have become a remarkable communication technology in IoT. Because the LPWAN provides long range communication with low power, it can be widely exploited for IoE applications. To improve quality of service, data traffic should be transmitted by considering its priority. However, this is not easy because the LPWAN has a low data rate and long transmission delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-channel medium access control (MAC) to satisfy these requirements in the LPWAN. Generated data is classified into three categories by considering traffic characteristics and is delivered with different priority in dual channels. The performance evaluation is carried out with computer simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in the LPWAN.",

The foundation necessary for this purpose lies in the integration of sensors, which continuously provide context data of their environment.

Simultaneously, the dynamic behavior of the environment demands automated mechanisms for applications to adapt to the situations automatically and in a timely manner. To meet this challenge, we present (1) the situation model as a data model for integrating all data related to situation recognition, and (2) the management and provisioning of situations based on this situation model to further decouple situation recognition and applications adapting to recognized situations. Furthermore, we present a prototypical implementation of the situation model and its management.",

abstract="Hydro-, Aeolian and Solar energy show significant promise in helping to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases, which is a primary focus in today's sustainable development culture. To enjoy the power of them, the human society needs solutions to transform the energies mentioned above into electric energy, at specific reliability, efficiency and sustainability parameters. Maintaining this kind of parameters implies, among other things, the careful and permanent monitoring of equipment. The monitoring process implies remote monitoring, as we are talking about preserving natural resources. The equipment is mostly situated in the middle of nature, covering large areas mostly outside of populated locations. In their great majority installations for wind and solar energy have been designed and manufactured relatively recently, which makes them contain systems of tele-monitoring that are designed and included by default, as a part of great importance to the entire investment. The situation is different in the case of hydroelectric plants, which have a tradition of over 130 years and have been and are still built to this day. Renewable energy sources are being increasingly used and need to be constantly monitored for optimizing the power grid. Unfortunately, such micro power plants are located in difficult to access remote locations where often only satellite or sparse GSM radio signals are available. In this paper we study the way how to process big data gathered by a decentralized cloud system, based on general systems and remote telemetry units (RTUs), for tele-monitoring of renewable energy objectives. Also, we analyze a proposed cloud M2M system, where each RTU communicates by radio with a telemetry data gateway connected to a cloud computing infrastructure equipped with appropriate software that delivers processed data. Furthermore, we present how we use a search based application built on Exalead CloudView to search for weak signals in big data. In particular, given the telemetry application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from other online environmental wireless sensor networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between renewable energies and environmental related issues faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data. As a consequence, the software has a significant potential for matching environmental applications and challenges that are related in non-obvious ways. Finally, we present the measurement results for a hydro-energy case study and discuss the applicability for other renewable sources such as solar or wind energy.",

pages="180--193",
abstract="This paper proposes a simple terminology for understanding and dealing with two current phenomena; we suggest calling them heavyweight and lightweight IT. Heavyweight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT. The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT should be only loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation.",

abstract="Recently, the significance of internet of things (IoT) is rapidly growing in the next generation of information and communication technology due to rapid advances in wireless communication technologies which have triggered the development of low-power, reliable and miniaturized devices. These advances lead to the creation of IoT ecosystem that enables development of various services. Especially, there are a number of attempts to apply communication technology of IoT in the field of healthcare services which deals with medical applications such as a remote medical treatment. In IoT-based healthcare system, in general, a number of medical devices are densely deployed in narrow area. Therefore, they are exposed to signal interference among them which causes significant performance degradation. In this paper, we present an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based network interface and channel selection algorithm for multi-channel MAC protocols in IoT ecosystem that take into account a multitude of decision factors, such as expected channel condition, latency and frame reception ratio. The proposed scheme can provide flexibility for various requirements of different medical services through performing AHP. In particular, the proposed scheme considers IoT-based healthcare system because it is the most complex scenario of fundamental IoT applications. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive simulations, and the simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm provides low latency and high reliability.",

abstract="Complex engineering systems suffer from internal wears and tears that cannot be measured by sensors. Sudden failure of such systems is hazardous and may endanger human life. To avoid sudden failures, a prognostics system that takes multivariate sensor data and infers system health and then projects the inferred system health into future based on damage progression for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation in real time is needed. Logisticians, engineers, project managers, and others can also benefit from prognostics information to improve performance and reduce cost. Our contribution in this paper is to present a data-driven prognostics approach for RUL estimation of aircraft turbofan engines that run onboard in real time. Kalman filter and neural network are used together to infer system health from several sensor readings. The inferred system health is then projected by another neural network till the end of life for RUL calculation. The algorithm is implemented on Raspberry Pi 2 single-board computer running Windows 10 Internet of Things Core to enable efficient development and deployment of onboard prognostics applications. Data from PHM08 data challenge competition are used for algorithm development and testing. The results show the applicability of this approach for RUL estimation onboard in real time.",

abstract="In the late twentieth century, cities like Manchester, seen as the `original, modern' [1] world industrial city, faced serious challenges in terms of how to respond to the massive economic restructuring that was taking place. On the one hand, Manchester needed to respond to the highest rates of unemployment and social exclusion seen for more than 50 years, whilst, at the same time, the city wanted to develop innovative and practical solutions which could bring real economic and social benefits to local people. The impact of even more rapid technological change, referred to as the emerging `information society', which started to impact from the 1980s onwards, exacerbated this dilemma, accelerating the process of restructuring so that within urban areas new economic growth increasingly sat side by side with extremes of poverty, unemployment and other forms of social exclusion. This case study looks at the ways that Manchester, and key players from the city region, including the public sector, business, education and the community sector, responded to this and how those responses over the past 25+ years created new ambitions and aspirations for the city and its citizens. The conclusions focus on the concept of the `Smart City' and Manchester's ideas on creating a more inclusive, creative and sustainable city, including through the imaginative use of digital technologies, applications and services, and a commitment to open innovation and the co-production of new and innovative services.",

IoT technology has gradually been applied to industries and everyday life in general including healthcare, where people can access hospital information systems to view personal health and medical information. Still, due to security vulnerabilities, personal health and medical information is prone to hacking attacks. Thus, concerns over privacy invasion have come to the fore, and at the same time security issues are considered to override information services. This paper proposes a communication protocol based on hash lock, session keys, random numbers and security keys designed to be safe against intruders' hacking attempts in information communication between medical devices. Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program. In brief, the proposed communication protocol for medical devices is safe and secure against diverse attacks.",

abstract="The Cultural Heritage experience at the museum begins before the actual on-site visit and continues with memories and reflections after the visit. In considering the potential of novel information and communication technology to enhance the entire visit experience, one scenario envisioned is extending the on-site visit boundaries, to help the visitors access information concerning exhibits that are of primary interest to them during pre-visit planning, provide relevant information to the visitors during the visit, and follow up with post visit memories and reflections. All this can be done by using today's state of the art mobile and web-based applications, as well as any new foreseeable emerging technology. So far, research on applying novel information and communication technology in the cultural heritage domain has focused primarily on exploring specific aspects of the technology and its capability for supporting the individual visitor mainly during the physical, on-site, visit (and in some cases in additional specific phases such as prior or after the visit). This paper suggests a novel, integrative framework for supporting the pre, during and post visit phases in a personalized manner. It is based on a set of standard, common models: a visitor model, a site model and a visit model, all enable a large variety of services to store, update and reuse data during the three phases of the visit. Our contribution is presenting a framework architecture with its underlying infrastructure, and showing in a case study how this framework supports the various visit phases in an actual museum. The suggested framework is generic; it is not limited to a specific setting or scenario and it is open and can be easily adopted and used by practitioners and researchers to be implemented in different sites and settings. As such, it provides a further step in extending the cultural heritage experience beyond the on-site visit and towards linking individual episodes into complete, memorable personal experiences.",

The user study is the first stage of a research agenda that concerns the implementation of a novel conceptual framework for the design and continuous evolution of `sentient multimedia systems', namely socio-technical systems, where people and many kinds of hardware/software components (sensors, robots, smart devices, web services, etc.) interact with one another through the exchange of multimedia information, to give rise to intelligent, proactive behaviors. The conceptual framework is structured along three layers - physical, inference and user -- and is based on an information space of events, conditions and actions, linked together in Event-Condition-Action rules and operating according to the interconnection metaphor. The results of the user study have provided some indications for the implementation of the user layer, suggesting which could be the most suitable interaction style for rule design by a community of end users (e.g. a family) and which issues should be addressed in such a wide context.",

abstract="Within the political economy of informational capitalism, commercial surveillance practices are tools for resource extraction. That process requires an enabling legal construct, which this essay identifies and explores. Contemporary practices of personal information processing constitute a new type of public domain---a repository of raw materials that are there for the taking and that are framed as inputs to particular types of productive activity. As a legal construct, the biopolitical public domain shapes practices of appropriation and use of personal information in two complementary and interrelated ways. First, it constitutes personal information as available and potentially valuable: as a pool of materials that may be freely appropriated as inputs to economic production. That framing supports the reorganization of sociotechnical activity in ways directed toward extraction and appropriation. Second, the biopolitical public domain constitutes the personal information harvested within networked information environments as raw. That framing creates the backdrop for culturally situated techniques of knowledge production and for the logic that designates those techniques as sites of legal privilege.",

abstract="This paper is about characterizing intelligence in Smart Physical Objects, i.e., objects based on the tight and seamless integration of a physical and a digital counterpart. The design of these objects gives rise to new opportunities but requires taking into account a number of dimensions that contribute to smartness. In our view, supported by considerable literature on this subject, smart behavior is the result of proper combinations of several dimensions of intelligence. In the paper we analyze these dimensions, singling out different alternatives leading to different capabilities of smart objects. The contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to guide a designer in making decisions about smartness in the physical object being designed, starting from its requisites. At the same time the framework provides an effective guide to classify and compare smart physical objects according to the type and level of smartness they exhibit. We apply the approach to a set of smart physical objects showing its suitability and usefulness.",

The results show significant influences from performance expectancy, effort expectancy and technology anxiety on attitude to use RFID-enabled services, while facilitating conditions and attitude to use both have significant influences on intention to use the services. Looking into potential moderating influences, gender moderates most of the relationships in the model while age and experience with identification technology do not seem to be relevant moderators. Exploring the potential moderating influence of context experience, experience of the service context is found to moderate some of the relationships in the model. Managerial implications point to the importance of developing useful and user-friendly services and of communicating the user friendliness to potential customers to avoid the potential negative influence of technology anxiety. Service development and market communication should be sensitive to gender and context experience.",

China and the US have adopted converging approaches to address these challenges: inserting e-commerce chapters into their FTAs. However, the substance of these chapters is diverging. Firstly, US FTAs categorise digital products separately from goods and services and provide national treatment and most favoured nation treatment to products and their suppliers. China's FTAs still offer no solutions to the classification of digital products and their treatment. Secondly, although China's FTAs still provide weak protection for consumers and privacy, Chinese domestic law has converged towards US FTAs to provide better protection. Thirdly, US and China FTAs are significantly divergent in their regulation of the free flow of information. In the post-TPP era, a polycentric direction will emerge in the regulation of the free flow of information between China and the US.",

abstract="The machine to machine communication (MTC) has grown into one of the fastest expansion in the area of Information and Communication Technology and is one of the important aspect of the Internet of Things. It allows millions of devices to connect with each other over the internet. MTC has a huge market and massive strength to obtain numerous application scenarios. The applications of MTC are reliable and effective only after a successful authentication of MTC devices. Hence, there are several group based authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols were proposed by researchers. Whenever a number of MTC devices simultaneously generate the access request to the LTE/LTE-A network, each MTC device needs a separate authentication process to access the core network that leads to genuine signaling congestion problem. In addition, the existing group based AKA protocols did not equip with the group management scheme efficiently and also vulnerable to various known attacks. To avoid the aforesaid problems and mitigate the authentication complexity of the earlier schemes, we propose a dynamic group based efficient and secure (DGBES-AKA) protocol for MTC in LTE/LTE-A network. The proposed protocol consists the group key update scheme with key forward and backward secrecy. The formal verification using ProVerif and security analysis of the proposed protocol represent the security against malicious attacks. Finally, we show the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the DGBES-AKA protocol with the existing protocols. The analysis shows that the proposed protocol has improved results in terms of communication and computation overhead.",

abstract="Nowadays, along with the application of new-generation information technologies in industry and manufacturing, the big data-driven manufacturing era is coming. However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.",

abstract="Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing--structure--property--performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.",

This amalgamation of WBAN-based healthcare systems to cloud-based healthcare systems gave rise to serious privacy concerns to the sensitive healthcare data. Hence, there is a need for the proactive identification and effective mitigation mechanisms for these patient's data privacy concerns that pose continuous threats to the integrity and stability of the healthcare environment. For this purpose, a systematic literature review has been conducted that presents a clear picture of the privacy concerns of patient's data in cloud-assisted healthcare systems and analyzed the mechanisms that are recently proposed by the research community. The methodology used for conducting the review was based on Kitchenham guidelines. Results from the review show that most of the patient's data privacy techniques do not fully address the privacy concerns and therefore require more efforts. The summary presented in this paper would help in setting research directions for the techniques and mechanisms that are needed to address the patient's data privacy concerns in a balanced and light-weight manner by considering all the aspects and limitations of the cloud-assisted healthcare systems.",

abstract="Academic research into RFID technology has largely neglected ethics. What scarce research was being performed has now dwindled despite having some consumers continue to express their ethical concerns. This article aims at reducing this apparent void by exploring the antecedents that cause the public to react when consumers are targeted by RFID technology. Through the analysis of 11 real RFID implementations used to target consumers, our research indicates that several factors can influence consumer response through the distinct nature of the technology, namely, (1) Customization of communications, (2) Imposition of tag use, (3) Segmentation and targeting, (4) Modified role of the sales representative, (5) Physical distance between the consumer and the tag, and (6) Security of transactions. The article then proposes a construct to determine the risk of raising consumer ethical concerns. The construct of ``Connective Proximity'' and its three components (physical proximity, exposure time, and information proximity) are defined. Our research highlights the need for further studies on the ethical considerations of tagging humans and specifically tracking consumers when performing marketing activities with RFID technology. Our article aims at invigorating research on this topic, which has a lot to contribute to both society and corporations.",

abstract="With decrease in the cost and the size of sensor devices, we can envision a world of ubiquitous sensor networks. Usually, sensor data needs to be disseminated from the source to data collectors, making the spatially distributed sensor data available for applications. The widespread and ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, e.g., PDAs and cell phones around the world, makes them attractive to be used as mobile data collectors (MDCs) to collect and deliver the sensor data. The goal of this work is to design a dissemination protocol that leads to efficient data delivery from the source sensors to ubiquitous MDCs. We propose the Wait-Focus-Spray (WFS) data delivery scheme for wireless sensor networks with ubiquitous MDCs. The main objective of WFS is to balance the data delivery latency and transmission overhead when considering the existence of ubiquitous MDCs. In WFS, we also propose a corresponding mechanism-probabilistic scattered binary spraying (PSBS), to reduce the spatial redundancy when spraying data copies, which can increase the probability of meeting a MDC. We then present an analytical model based on the Markov chain model to analyze the trade-off between delivery latency and transmission cost in WFS. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme reduces the transmission cost per message while provides comparable delivery delay compared with the alternative approach.",

Work on next generation mobile communication system (5G) i.e. IMT 2020 is underway and likely to come in the year 2020. The 5G network envisages data speed of 1 Tbps and beyond. To realise the IMT 2020, radio spectrum is an essential element. Presently, mobile communications are operating between 700 and 3600 MHz. These spectrum bands do not have the capacity to carry such enormous data. Millimeter (mm) frequency band beyond 10 GHz is the most preferred band for 5G. Radiocommunication sector of ITU is in the process to identify the frequency bands for IMT 2020, which will be finalised in the WRC 2019.

abstract="The emergence of mobile healthcare systems is an important outcome of application of pervasive computing concepts for medical care purposes. These systems provide the facilities and infrastructure required for automatic and ubiquitous sharing of medical information. Healthcare systems have a dynamic structure and configuration, therefore having an architecture is essential for future development of these systems. The need for increased response rate, problem limited storage, accelerated processing and etc. the tendency toward creating a new generation of healthcare system architecture highlight the need for further focus on cloud-based solutions for transfer data and data processing challenges. Integrity and reliability of healthcare systems are of critical importance, as even the slightest error may put the patients' lives in danger; therefore acquiring a behavioral model for these systems and developing the tools required to model their behaviors are of significant importance. The high-level designs may contain some flaws, therefor the system must be fully examined for different scenarios and conditions. This paper presents a software architecture for development of healthcare systems based on pervasive computing concepts, and then models the behavior of described system. A set of solutions are then proposed to improve the design's qualitative characteristics including, availability, interoperability and performance.",

abstract="Healthy people are important for any nation's development. Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called ``Big Data.'' Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called ``Intelligent Building,'' depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system has the capability of efficiently processing WBAN sensory data from millions of users in order to perform real-time responses in case of emergencies.",

The platform has been defined by the media as a flexible (enable the addition of any kind of application or service) and open (enable access to open services) Italian ``cloud'' that allows public administrations to access to a vast knowledge base represented as linked open data to be reused by a stakeholder community with the aim of developing new applications (``Cloud Apps'') tailored to the specific needs of citizens. The platform has been used by Catania and Syracuse municipalities, two of the main cities of southern Italy, located in the Sicilian region. The fully adoption of the platform is rapidly spreading around the whole region (local developers have already used available application programming interfaces (APIs) to create additional services for citizens and administrations) to such an extent that other provinces of Sicily and Italy in general expressed their interest for its usage. The platform is available online and, as mentioned above, is open source and provides APIs for full exploitation.",

It is expected that mobile {\&} ubiquitous Telemedicine, integrated with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), have a great potential in fostering the provision of next-generation u-Health. Despite the recent efforts and achievements, current u-Health proposed solutions still suffer from shortcomings hampering their adoption today. This paper presents a comprehensive review of up-to-date requirements in hardware, communication, and computing for next-generation u-Health systems. It compares new technological and technical trends and discusses how they address expected u-Health requirements. A thorough survey on various worldwide recent system implementations is presented in an attempt to identify shortcomings in state-of-the art solutions. In particular, challenges in WBAN and ubiquitous computing were emphasized. The purpose of this survey is not only to help beginners with a holistic approach toward understanding u-Health systems but also present to researchers new technological trends and design challenges they have to cope with, while designing such systems.",

It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

abstract="As an important part of Internet of Things, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system employs low-cost RFID tag to communicate with everything containing animate and inanimate objects. This technology is widely used in the e-healthcare applications. However, the malicious communication environment makes people more and more worried. In order to overcome the hazards in the network, RFID authentication schemes for e-healthcare have been proposed by researchers. But since the computation ability of the tag is relatively weak, it is necessary to put forward a lightweight and secure scheme for medical systems. Moreover, cloud is widely accepted by people and used in many kinds of systems. So we propose a novel and lightweight RFID authentication scheme with cloud for e-healthcare applications. We use an enhanced formal security model to prove the security of our scheme. In this model the channel between the server and the reader is considered to be insecure and informal analysis is used to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Through the formal and informal analysis, our scheme not only resists the common attacks, but also keeps mutual authentication, information integrity, forward untraceability and backward untraceability. Moreover, both the tag and the reader can reach the anonymity. Our scheme is only hash-based and suitable to realize various security requirements. Compared to recent schemes of the same sort, it is more applicable in e-healthcare.",

Primarily the focus is on gait analysis methodologies exploiting average speed, however this presents an issue when used for context aware applications. Additionally data capture tends to be in short bursts over a long period, allowing for localized temporal factors, such as short term injury, to potentially skew measurements. As such this work collects gait and trajectory IoT data from elderly adults in senior homes (``in the wild'') over a sustained period of time (1 year). Density based clustering algorithms are then applied to the data to provide long-term insights into how the high density regions change over time. The data is collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client utilizing available processing resources and delivers the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained from the long-term study, suggesting that this form of evaluation has strong potential in the analysis of cognitive and physical status deterioration.",

abstract="Healthcare services are complex and life-critical. One mistake in any procedure may lead to irremediable consequences; numerous researchers, thus, introduce information and communication technology to improve quality of services and enhance patient safety by reducing the medical errors. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is considered as one of the emerging tool assist in meeting the challenges of the present situation. In recent years, RFID has been applied in medical organizations for the purpose of managing and tracking medical equipment, monitoring and identifying patients, ensuring that the right medication is given to the right patient, and preventing the use of counterfeit medicine. However, most of the existing literature focuses on demonstrating how RFID can benefit the healthcare industry, whereas little attention has been given to the management issues involved in constructing an RFID project in medical organizations. In this paper, an exploratory case study is conducted in a medical organization to illustrate the development framework and critical issues that should be taken into consideration in the preparation, implementation and maintenance stage of constructing such a project. All the experiences and results discussed in this paper offer valuable and useful insights to steer those who would like to start their journey using RFID in medical organizations.",

abstract="Customized/personalized products are gaining more shares in today's product market. Such products need collective efforts from consumers, manufacturers and third parties. This requirement has not been well addressed due to both market and technology factors. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) provides real-time sensing/actuating ability and fast transmission capability of data/information, so that remote operation of manufacturing activities and efficient collaboration among stakeholders are greatly facilitated. This provides great opportunities to address the requirement mentioned above. Thus we propose a full-connection model of product design and manufacturing in the IoT-enabled cloud manufacturing environment. The proposed model uses social networks to connect multiple parties and facilitate open innovations, and use IoT to glue physical space to cyber space and cloud manufacturing to provide various elastic services, so that the on-demand workspace, interaction, information sharing or collective problem solving are enabled. We also propose a supporting infrastructure for this model using the latest information and communication technologies. Finally, we present a case study of an RFID enabled production system for customized and personalized product with the ability to enable a new paradigm of ``dynamic processes and close collaborations among different roles'' and ensure robust production.",

pages="597--609",
abstract="Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are target-oriented and advanced cyber-attacks which often leverage the bot control and customized malware techniques in order to control and remotely access valuable information. APTs generally use various attack techniques to gain access to the unauthorized system and then progressively spread throughout the network. The prime objectives of APT attacks are to steal intellectual property, legal documents, sensitive internal business and other data. If an attack is successfully launched on a system, the timely detection of attack is extremely important to stop APTs from further spreading and for mitigating its impact. On the other hand, internet of things (IoT) devices quickly become ubiquitous while IoT services become pervasive. Their prosperity has not gone unnoticed, and the number of attacks and threats against IoT devices and services are also increasing. Cyber-attacks are not new to IoT, but as the IoT will be deeply intertwined in our societies and lives, it becomes essential to take cyber defense seriously. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed framework architecture for the detection of APTs named as distributed framework architecture for APTs detection (DFA-AD), which is a promising basis for modern intrusion detection systems. In contrast to other approaches, the DFA-AD technique for detecting APT attack is based on multiple parallel classifiers, which classify the events in a distributed environment and event correlation among those events. Each classifier method is focused on detecting the APT's attack technique independently. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieves greater effectiveness and accuracy.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) becomes an inevitable technology for ICT convergence. It gathers information from various objects and provides intelligent services through analyzing the information. To collect surrounding information, IoT employs a sensor network, which is a low-power wireless communication network with numerous sensor nodes. Sensor nodes in conventional sensor networks have short transmission range. However, it is required a sensor network with long transmission range as well as low transmission power consumption for various IoT services. Long transmission range of IoT devices affects transmission environment. Lots of sensor nodes (i.e., IoT devices) in the long range sensor network transmit data to a given gateway node in order to deliver data to a network server. The gateway node can experience serious traffic load to relay the data. It causes to drop transmission efficiency. Therefore, for efficient data transmission, a network architecture and a data transmission method for long range IoT services are necessary. This paper proposes the network and data transmission architecture for the long range sensor networks. The proposed network architecture is based on oneM2M IoT standard. It has Infrastructure Node (IN), Middle Node (MN) and Application Service Node (ASN) as network elements. In the proposed method, IN employs cloned MNs to reduce the traffic load at the MN, which is the gateway. ASN delivers data through MN or cloned MNs to the IN. Through the load balancing by the proposed method at the MN, the efficient data transmission for IoT services in long range sensor networks can be provided. The performance of the proposed method is validated by the computer simulation.",

The cloud computing satisfies the need of store and manage model. Whereas to access and protect data, many intense technologies like parallel and map reduce methods are available. But these methods face difficulties in large data processing. In this article these traditional difficulties are overcome by Hadoop data model to give a high performance computing of large data in cloud computing environment. In the experiment, the proposed method was compared with previous works. As a result, the proposed method achieved 0.51 Packet delivery ratio with 0.71s Elapsed Time/Word transfer at the Receiver throughput of 770kbps, which is much better than that of previous work. The single cluster and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to compute data along with Hadoop to provide fault tolerance over failures, less processing time and communication errors.",

The pricing method to the suppliers based on the opportunity cost method is presented and a detailed analysis using 62 bus Indian utility system has been carried out by considering diverse cases. In this proposed pricing method, the services of the cloud technology have been used to provide transparent pricing based on the demands of the consumers. The power demands at the consumers' site is calculated without the human involvement using the Internet of Things and the same is uploaded in the cloud. In reactive power pricing, the system operator acts as a mediator between the suppliers and consumers. Based on the demand and availability of power, the system operator provides the cost for the service to the consumer through cloud.",

abstract="Ubiquitous Sensor Network describes an application platform comprised of intelligently networked sensors deployed over a large area, supporting multiple application scenarios. On one hand, at the user-end, storing and managing the large amount of heterogeneous data generated by the network is a daunting task. On the other hand, at the network-end, ensuring network connectivity and longevity in a dynamically changing network environment, while trying to provide context-aware application data to the end-users are very challenging for the resource constrained sensor network. While cloud computing offers a cost-effective solution for storage of the large volume of data generated by the underlying heterogeneous network, an equally elegant solution does not exist on the network interface to provide application-aware data. In this paper, we propose the use of cognitive nodes (CNs) in the underlying sensor network to provide intelligent information processing and knowledge-based services to the end-users. We identify tools and techniques to implement the cognitive functionality and formulate a strategy for the deployment of CNs in the underlying sensor network to ensure a high probability of successful data reception among communicating nodes. From Matlab simulations, we were able to verify that in a network with randomly deployed sensor nodes, CNs can be strategically deployed at pre-determined positions, to deliver application-aware data that satisfies the end-user's quality of information requirements, even at high application payloads.",

abstract="The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) concept was appeared in the middle of 90s and have been a subject under intensive research in the past few years. Several factors have contributed to this, but the potential for application of WSNs in almost every aspect of day-to-day life is the predominant one. This type of networks has been developed using proprietary solutions instead of standard solutions. More recently, the importance of standards motivated the use of IETF standards in WSNs, making the Internet integration easier. However, more efforts are necessary in order to provide a full integration. The WSNs use mainly IPv6 protocol, but the IPv4 is the predominant one in the Internet. As a consequence, IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms must be provided to allow the interaction between all Internet connected devices independently of the supported IP version. It is also critical to provide a standard application interface to make easier the application development and independently of the hardware platform used. The RESTfull Web services can provide this standard interface. So, combine RESTfull Web services with IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms can increase the WSN services dissemination. The transition mechanisms and the REST Web services are supported in the gateway in order to save the wireless sensor device resources'. The smartphone with Internet connectivity can also be the drive to the WSNs growth, because user-friendly applications can be used to retrieve and collect sensed data. This paper proposes a solution based on REST web services to permit the interaction between a mobile application and the IPv6 compliant WSN.",

abstract="Recently, the video data has very huge volume, taking one city for example, thousands of cameras are built of which each collects high-definition video over 24--48 GB every day with the rapidly growth; secondly, data collected includes variety of formats involving multimedia, images and other unstructured data; furthermore the valuable information contains in only a few frames called key frames of massive video data; and the last problem caused is how to improve the processing velocity of a large amount of original video with computers, so as to enhance the crime prediction and detection effectiveness of police and users. In this paper, we conclude a novel architecture for next generation public security system, and the ``front + back'' pattern is adopted to address the problems brought by the redundant construction of current public security information systems which realizes the resource consolidation of multiple IT resources, and provides unified computing and storage environment for more complex data analysis and applications such as data mining and semantic reasoning. Under the architecture, we introduce cloud computing technologies such as distributed storage and computing, data retrieval of huge and heterogeneous data, provide multiple optimized strategies to enhance the utilization of resources and efficiency of tasks. This paper also presents a novel strategy to generate a super-resolution image via multi-stage dictionaries which are trained by a cascade training process. Extensive experiments on image super-resolution validate that the proposed solution can get much better results than some state-of-the-arts ones.",

abstract="A great number of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) based applications, which are telecommunication areas with the highest foreseen growth in the future years, require energy efficient, long range and low data rate wireless communication links. In order to offer a competitive solution in these areas, IEEE 802.11 standardization group has defined the ``ah'' amendment, the first sub-1 GHz WLAN standard, with flexible channel bandwidths, starting from 1 MHz, up to 16 MHz, and many other physical and link layer improvements, enabling long-range and energy efficient communications. However, for some regions, like Europe, the maximum transmitted power in dedicated frequency band is limited to only 10 mW, thus disabling the achievement of ranges which would be close to targeted of up to 1 km. In this paper we examine possibilities for range extension through implementation of half-duplex decode-and forward (DF) relay station (RS) in communication between an access point (AP) and an end-station (ST). Assuming a Rician fading channel between AP and RS, and a Rayleigh fading channel on RS--ST link, we analytically derive results on achievable ranges for the most robust modulation and coding schemes (MCSs), both on downlink (DL) and uplink (UL). Analyses are performed for two different standard adopted deployment scenarios on RS--ST link, and variable end-to-end link outage probabilities. Moreover, we have analyzed whether the considered most robust MCSs, known for supporting the longest range, but the lowest data rates, can meet the defined requirement of at least 100 kb/s for the greatest attainable AP--RS--ST distances. We examine data rate enhancements, brought by coding and using of short packets, for both DL and UL. Finally, we present bit error rate results, obtained through simulations, of a dual-hop DF IEEE 802.11ah relay system for the considered MCs. All presented results confirm that IEEE 802.11ah systems through deployment of relay stations, become an interesting solution for M2M and IoT based applications, due to flexibility they offer in many aspects, meeting requirements for wide transmission ranges in such applications.",

The need to maximize the utilization of these resources has also resulted in interest in cloud based vehicular networks (CVNs), an area of active research. This paper survey the CVNs literature published between 2010 and 2016. In addition, a taxonomy based on three main CVN categories, namely vehicular cloud computing (VCC), vehicle using cloud (VuC) and hybrid cloud (HC), is presented. In the taxonomy, we focus on related systems, architectures, applications and services. Although VCC has been extensively discussed in the literature, a comprehensive survey on the two other categories is lacking. Hence, this motivates our research. Through an extensive comparison of common characteristics among cloud computing, mobile cloud computing, VCC, VuC and HC and overview of the existing architectures, we present a conceptual HC architecture. Finally, we conclude the paper with open issues and challenges.",

In this work, we mainly address the problem of node connectivity analysis based on percolation theory. First, we investigate when it is possible for two nodes to communicate with each other. Based on the results from bond percolation in a two-dimensional lattice, as long as the probability is close less than 0.5 and each sub-square contains at least four nodes, percolation occurs. Then, the conditions for full connectivity in a network graph are established. How two adjacent sub-squares are connected differentiates this work from others. The full connectivity occurs almost surely if each sub-square contains at least one node and the probability of having an open sub-edge is no less than 0.3822. The proposed conditions for percolation and full connectivity are validated by simulations.",

This work presents a Secure User Profiling Structure which has the patient information including their health information. A patient and a hospital keep it at that same time, they share the updated data. While they share the data and communicate, the data can be leaked. To solve the security problems, a secure communication channel with a hash function and an One-Time Password between a client and a hospital should be established and to generate an input value to an OTP, it uses a dual hash-function. This work presents a dual hash function-based approach to generate the One-Time Password ensuring a secure communication channel with the secured key. In result, attackers are unable to decrypt the leaked information because of the secured key; in addition, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of computation cost.",

abstract="Bundling is the practice of selling two or more products together, often at a discounted price. In this article, we extend the concept of bundling to a wide variety of choice settings. We argue that bundle choice covers consumer decision scenarios, which differ with respect to three key dimensions: the number of product categories in the bundle, the party in the distribution system who constructs the bundles, and the time frame of the bundle choice decision. These situational differences are important, from the standpoint of constructing an appropriate choice model and developing an appropriate framework for managerial decision-making. We describe five research perspectives prevalent in bundle choice research (i.e., economic, attribute-based, psychological, multi-category choice, and bundle dynamics). We provide detailed discussion of several areas of current interest: and identify unresolved issues in bundling research: understanding the multiple rationales behind bundling strategies, specification and calibration of bundle choice models, and impact of Big Data, and optimal bundle design. We conclude that bundle choice research provides rich opportunities for collaboration among economists, psychologists, and choice theory experts in marketing science.",

In the health- and medical-service areas, IT supports Internet of things (IoT)-based medical services and health-care systems for patients. Medical facilities have been advanced on the basis of such IoT devices, and the digitized information on human behaviors and health makes the delivery of efficient and convenient health care possible. Under the given circumstances, health and medical care have been researched. For some of this research, the patient-health data were collected using IoT-based medical devices, and they served as a tool for medical diagnosis and treatment. This study proposes the development of a medical big-data mining process for which topic modeling is employed. The proposed method uses the big data that are offered by the open system of the health- and medical-services big data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, and their application follows the guidelines of the knowledge discovery in big-data process for data mining and topic modeling. For the medical data regarding the topic modeling, the public structured health- and medical-services big data, Open API, and patient datasets were used. For the document classification in the semantic situation of a topic, the Bag of Words technique and the latent Dirichlet allocation method were applied to find the document association for the development of the medical big-data mining process. In addition, this study conducted a performance evaluation of the topic-modeling accuracy based on the medical big-data mining process and the topic-modeling efficiency, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was examined.",

abstract="As healthcare is one of major socioeconomic problems in cities, mobile healthcare network becomes one of core components of smart cities, which would improve urban healthcare environment. However, there are wide privacy concerns as personal health information is outsourced to untrusted cloud servers. It is a promising method to encrypt the health data before outsourcing, but how to do diagnosis computations on the encrypted health data remains an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a general architecture of the mobile healthcare network, and define three typical secure medical computations, which include the average heart rate, the long QT syndrome detection, and the chi-square tests. To achieve computations on the ciphertext, we leverage fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt the health data. Different from previous related works, we use more efficient Dowlin's FHE scheme to implement above three medical computations. In our implementation of the average heart rate, only one ciphertext is sent back to the receiver, so homomorphic decryption is needed once. We take an efficient l-bits comparator to implement the long QT syndrome detection, which only needs l XOR operations and one homomorphic multiplication. We first implement the chi-square tests by homomorphic additions and homomorphic multiplications, which can be used to study whether varicose veins is relevant to overweight. Extensive simulations and analytical results show the scalability and efficiency of our proposed scheme.",

abstract="The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and `silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.",

We aimed to elicit new knowledge about (1) the characteristics of the expected user experience and (2) central user requirements related to MAR in such a context. From a pragmatic viewpoint, the participants expected MAR services to catalyse their sense of efficiency, empower them with novel context-sensitive and proactive functionalities and raise their awareness of the information related to their surroundings with an intuitive interface.

title="Influence of overhead on LTE downlink performance: a comprehensive model",
journal="Telecommunication Systems",
year="2017",
month="Jul",
day="07",
abstract="Overhead resource elements (REs) in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks are used for some control, signaling and synchronization tasks at both the Physical level and Media Access Control sub-level. Accurately computing all the overhead REs is necessary to achieve an efficient system design, which is difficult because LTE is a complex standard that contains a large number of implementation flexibilities and system configurations. The number of such REs depends on both the system configurations and services demanded. Aiming at exploring the influence of overhead on LTE downlink performance, we first parametrize each system configuration---including parameters corresponding to enhancement techniques such as Adaptive Modulation and Coding and Multi-Antenna Transmissions techniques---and those of the resource allocation mechanisms (which depend on users'  services). Second, using such parametrization, we model all overheads for synchronization, controlling and signaling operations in LTE Physical Downlink Shared/Control Channels. This allows for dynamically computing the useful REs (by subtracting the overhead REs from the total ones), both per Transmission Time Interval (TTI) and per frame (and hence, the corresponding bit rates). Our data rate-based performance model is able to accurately compute: (1) the real, exact system data rate or ``throughput'' (instead of approximations); and (2) the maximum number of simultaneous multi-service users per TTI that is able to support (called here ``capacity''). Aiming at understanding the impact of each overhead mechanism, we have carried out a variety of simulations, including different service provision scenarios, such as multi-user with multi-application. The simulation results prove our starting hypothesis that the influence of overhead on LTE performance should not be neglected. The parametrized and dynamic model quantifies to what extent throughput and capacity are modified by overhead---under a combination of system configurations and services, and may provide these performance metrics, throughput and capacity, as inputs to planning, dimensioning and optimization specialized tools.",

All these changes bring forth new research questions about the kinds of services which could be provided, the ways for effectively conveying new forms of personalisation and recommendation, and how traditional user modeling should change to exploit ubiquitous and wearable technology to provide these services. In this paper we follow the evolution of user modeling process, starting from the traditional User Model and progressing to RWUM - Real World User Model, which contains data from a person's everyday life. We tried to answer the above questions and to present a conceptual framework that represents the RWUM process, which might be used as a reference model for designing RWUM-based systems.

Part of these strategies is to develop new types of innovation approaches in urban areas, which are characterized, firstly, by a high level of citizen involvement in co-creating Internet-based applications in all sectors of the economy and society; secondly, by the emergence of new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutes, universities, and companies. Such strategies and the resulting ``innovation ecosystems'' are becoming increasingly relevant given the growing economic and social issues and opportunities that cities are currently facing. This special issue investigates these smart city strategies through four smart city case studies and two papers addressing horizontal issues. The case studies aim to analyze the currently emerging strategies and policies related to identify how the opportunities of the Future Internet are being used for the socio-economic development of urban areas. The four cases also address how cities are redefining their innovation structures and how they started to experiment citizens involvement within the context of open innovation, and present lessons learned that are of interest to smart city stakeholders.",

abstract="Smart Specialisation has become the catchword for innovation policy approaches to optimally leverage regional dynamism in knowledge creation and application, and thus achieving comparative advantages in a globalised knowledge economy. It can support innovation policies putting the grand societal challenges of the twenty-first century high on the political agenda by intelligently investing the available resources in harnessing unique regional assets (as well as their inter-regional combinations), which were identified and capitalised on by `entrepreneurial discovery' processes. This paper argues that research driven clusters as local nodes of global knowledge flows and as `microcosms' in a complex world of cross-cutting regional and sector innovation systems, provide promising `targets' for strategic policy support fostering smart specialisation. By being integrated in global value chains, and at the same time embedded in their regional innovation systems, higher-order learning and priority-setting processes of (quadruple helix) cluster stakeholders can lead to increased return on public and private investments within and across regions: they enable the application of technological know-how for innovative solutions to address global challenges, and thus help optimise the application of `localised' knowledge capabilities for regional prosperity. Our case study---MicroTEC S{\"u}dwest, a German ``Spitzen'' cluster in the top-ranking, `associational' innovation system of Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg---spans an area of more than five million inhabitants, comparable in size with some countries in Europe. With this, we can exemplify elements of promising Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) outlining the participatory processes implemented to develop better-informed outward-looking (across sectors, borders, etc.), and more forward-looking strategies for evidence-based priority-setting and focusing investments.",

abstract="With the advancement of communication technologies, the number of devices connected to the internet is increasing exponentially day by day. Multiple IoT applications have been evolved since recent past. Low power consumption, accuracy of transmission and robustness takes the center stage in developing these applications. IEEE 802.15.4 is a low power protocol for low range low data rate scenario. In this paper, we propose a minimal error modified IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver for IoT applications in health care. The health-care scenario, due to its critical nature, calls for an error free communication. We propose a modified frequency offset estimator which performs better in terms of error variance than the existing estimators for IEEE 802.15.4. The simulation result shows that the bit error rate and packet error rate performance of the proposed transceiver are significantly improved compared to the standard architecture. The proposed transceiver reduces the power consumption due to less number of retransmission per packet for successful transmission of the packet.",

abstract="Ubiquitous smart devices with embedded sensors are paving the way for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that enable users to communicate directly, thereby playing a key role in Smart City and Internet of Things applications. In such smart environments, people with smart devices (nodes) can freely self-organize and form self-configuring MANETs to send and forward data packets to a destination over multiple hops via intermediate nodes. However, the energy consumption during routing remains a challenge in such ensemble mobile environments due to the limited battery capacity of mobile devices. This challenging issue has received substantial research attention, necessitating an exhaustive literature search over the variety of academic fields addressing this topic. The main motivation of this paper is to review various power-efficient routing schemes in MANETs that have recently been proposed to reduce the energy consumed when transmitting and receiving packets during active communication. Accordingly, these protocols are classified into six categories: (1) link state-based, (2) source-initiated-based, (3) transmission power control-based, (4) load-balancing-based, (5) location-based and (6) multicast-based routing approaches. The review covers various state-of-the-art protocols for each category and highlights their operation concepts, design challenges and key features. In addition, the various protocols are compared with emphasis on the merits and drawbacks as well as the considered metrics of each scheme. Finally, we provide a conclusion and suggest potential directions for future research in the field.",

abstract="Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) are still in their early stage of development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios and applications is tremendous. That range is extended by its inclusion in Internet with IPv6 Low-Power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs). This makes it obvious that multi-technology topologies, security and mobility support will be prevalent in 6LoWPAN. Mobility based communication increases the connectivity, and allows extending and adapting LoWPANs to changes in their location and environment infrastructure. However, the required mobility is heavily dependent on the individual service scenario and the LoWPAN architecture. In this context, an optimized solution is proposed for critical applications, such as military, fire rescue or healthcare, where people need to frequently change their position. Our scenario is health monitoring in an oil refinery where many obstacles have been found to the effective use of LoWPANs in these scenarios, mainly due to transmission medium features i.e. high losses, high latency and low reliability. Therefore, it is very difficult to provide continuous health monitoring with such stringent requirements on mobility. In this paper, a paradigm is proposed for mobility over 6LoWPAN for critical environments. On the one hand the intra-mobility is supported by GinMAC, which is an extension of IEEE 802.15.4 to support a topology control algorithm, which offers intra-mobility transparently, and Movement Direction Determination (MDD) of the Mobile Node (MN). On the other hand, the inter-mobility is based on pre-set-up of the network parameters in the visited networks, such as Care of Address and channel, to reach a fast and smooth handoff. Pre-set-up is reached since MDD allows discovering the next 6LoWPAN network towards which MN is moving. The proposed approach has been simulated, prototyped, evaluated, and is being studied in a scenario of wearable physiological monitoring in hazardous industrial areas, specifically oil refineries, in the scope of the GinSeng European project.",

The question raised by this article is whether the rise of such algorithmic governance creates problems for the moral or political legitimacy of our public decision-making processes. Ignoring common concerns with data protection and privacy, it is argued that algorithmic governance does pose a significant threat to the legitimacy of such processes. Modelling my argument on Estlund's threat of epistocracy, I call this the `threat of algocracy'. The article clarifies the nature of this threat and addresses two possible solutions (named, respectively, `resistance' and `accommodation'). It is argued that neither solution is likely to be successful, at least not without risking many other things we value about social decision-making. The result is a somewhat pessimistic conclusion in which we confront the possibility that we are creating decision-making processes that constrain and limit opportunities for human participation.",

abstract="Context-aware computing is the ability of Services and applications to adapt and react to context changes. Context modelling is a core feature of context-aware computing. Although a lot of research has been made in the field of context modelling, most of the context-aware computing proposals prefer to design their own customized context model instead of reusing an existing one. The main reason for this behaviour is that current context models present some problems concerning reusability, extensibility and adaptation. To contribute solving these issues, in this paper we present 3LConOnt, a three-level context ontology that can be easily reused, extended and adapted for specific or generic purposes. The proposed context model consolidates the context knowledge already available from a modular perspective yielding a clear schema of knowledge reutilization. To do so, we gathered context knowledge pieces from different ontologies to be integrated into standardized and well-defined levels of abstraction and modules. The proposal has been validated considering: (1) reusability, extensibility and adaptation by instantiating different smart scenarios; (2) consistency and reasoning by triggering queries to the proposed model based on some competence questions; and (3) reusability in existing ontologies by importing the needed module or level of the model. Additionally, we also illustrate its usability in context-aware Services by modelling a context-aware framework architecture for supporting the whole context life cycle: acquisition, modelling, reasoning and distribution.",

Given the pace of technological development and the popularity of these new forms of social interaction, this scenario is plausible. However, it brings with it ethical problems. Two central ethical issues are addressed: those of privacy and those of autonomy. VRSNs pose threats to both privacy and autonomy. The threats to privacy can be broadly categorized as threats to informational privacy, threats to physical privacy, and threats to associational privacy. Each of these threats is further subdivided. The threats to autonomy can be broadly categorized as threats to freedom, to knowledge and to authenticity. Again, these three threats are divided into subcategories. Having categorized the main threats posed by VRSNs, a number of recommendations are provided so that policy-makers, developers, and users can make the best possible use of VRSNs.",

month="Jan",
day="25",
abstract="Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a key technology trend in emerging internet of things paradigms which are commonly used for application areas such as smart-cities, smart-grids, wearables, and connected health. There is a wealth of literature which considers various cluster-based routing protocols such as LEACH, HEED, and UHEED where these protocols are compared in terms of the network lifetime and/or the total number of packets successfully received by the base station under various operational conditions. While existing studies present various approaches to form WSN clusters in the most efficient way, various parameters are manually-assigned their values such as the radius of the cluster, the number of nodes in the cluster, and the number of clusters that should be formed to reach the base station. The choice of correct parameters is essential for reaching the most efficient configuration, however existing studies do not specify a systematic way for tuning these parameters. In other words, the optimization of cluster-based WSNs through fine tuning of related system parameters is not considered in the existing studies. We believe that presenting a generic approach to tune the parameters of clustering algorithms in order to optimize the performance metrics of WSNs is a significant contribution. In this study a systematic and an efficient method is presented to tune the parameters of clustering and routing protocols. Instead of brute force, or trial and error approaches, simulated annealing and K-beams algorithms are adopted together with discrete event system simulator OMNET++ with Castalia Framework. Results are presented comparatively with brute force approach in order to show the efficiency of the new approach in finding the optimum configuration in terms of energy efficiency as well as the rate of successfully received packets.",

The medical data of patients is collected by sensors and transmitted using wireless communication techniques. Different users can access the patient's data with different privileges. Access control is a crucial problem in WBANs. In this paper, we design a new security mechanism named combined public-key scheme in the case of attribute-based (CP-ABES) to address the user access control in WBANs. Our scheme combines encryption and digital signatures. It uses ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to achieve data confidentially, access control, and ciphertext-policy attribute-based signature to realize the identity authentication. The access policy used in our scheme is threshold. Based on this feature, the length of ciphertext and signature of our scheme is constant. Our scheme provides confidentiality, unforgeability, signer privacy and collusion resistance. We prove the efficiency of our scheme theoretically and analyze the security level and energy consumption of our scheme.",

Although these technologies typically adhere to the functional requirements defined by their developers, many of these solutions evidence limitations for being adopted by end-users, i.e., older adults. This paper reports the authors' experience in the design and deployment of several iterations of the SocialConnector system---a computer-supported family communication mediator---as a case study that helps identify key factors that ease the adoption of ambient intelligent systems encouraging intergenerational family communication at home. The particularity of the followed approach is to assemble widely available mass-market technology---such as commercial Tablet PCs and TV displays---glued together with innovative software, as a way to drive system adoption through economically affordable hardware running over empirically-driven considerations for designing effective software in this study domain. The case study results help researchers and practitioners to conceive technology that has a better chance of being embraced by older adults and their supporting family networks; particularly, when such a technology is going to be deployed in their homes. Therefore, the key design factors identified in this paper can be used to inform the conception and modeling of ambient intelligent systems that help older adults address several aspects of their aging in place process, like health monitoring, personal security, social engagement, support to daily activities, and ultimately, fostering wellbeing.",

Since IoT technologies have the potential to be pervasive in almost every aspect of a human life, in this paper, we deeply analyze the IoT scenario. First, we describe IoT in simple terms and then we investigate what current technologies can achieve. Our analysis shows four major issues that may limit the use of IoT (i.e., interoperability, security, privacy, and business models) and it highlights possible solutions to solve these problems. Finally, we provide a simulation analysis that emphasizes issues and suggests practical research directions.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen rapidly advancing as it is emerging as next technology revolution. IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) plays a main communication interface in IoT since it is able to bridge the lightweight underlying IEEE 802.15.4 protocols and IPv6. Proxy MIPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based localized mobility management which ideal for 6LoWPAN network because the mobile node in the PMIPv6 domain is not involved with IP mobility signalling. However, PMIPv6 is restricted to communicate in single hop network. It is impractical for 6LoWPAN network which is composed of low-power sensor nodes that have limited transmission power. In this paper, a new mobility support mechanism named the Sensor Prefix-Mapping Scheme (SP-MS) is proposed in the context of providing efficient node mobility support. The experiment is carried out by deploying two constrained 6LoWPAN networks with Contiki Operating System and a PMIPv6 backhaul network with OpenAirInterface Proxy Mobile IPv6. The results proved the efficiency of proposed SP-MS; the 0.79 {\%} round-trip delay increment with increasing number of hops when all nodes are sending packets simultaneously is considered insignificant. Besides, the handoff components are optimized to outperform the previous MIPv6 implementation (Roth et al. in Proceedings of the 9th ACM symposium on performance evaluation of wireless ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks, pp. 77--84, 2012) in term of inter-network handoff delay in one hop scenario. These findings suggest the efficiency of proposed SP-MS to support node mobility between multi-hop 6LoWPAN networks based on PMIPv6.",

abstract="Technical systems have become more and more complicated in recent decades and require more detailed control of their operation. This primarily relates to the safety, reliability, and efficiency of devices used in medicine, electronics, and other fields. Furthermore, with the development of the conception of the Internet of Things, a lot of attention has been paid to the interaction between humans and high-tech equipment and personal devices. Highly detailed information on the operation of a device or complex system can only be given by a large number of small sensors of different types. As we know, the most sophisticated sensory machine is a living organism. Formerly this thought led to the idea of creating a multisensory platform which would mimic the human skin capabilities. Electronic skin can simultaneously monitor many parameters such as temperature, strain, pressure, magnetic field, and intensity of light; it is also possible to emulate tactile and chemical perception. Nanotechnology serves as a tool for the creation of new sensor materials, and the development of printing technologies supports engineering low-cost, thin, lightweight, transparent, easily deformable, and biocompatible (even transient) electronic devices for monitoring external factors and processing information. In this review we discuss the state-of-the-art and prospects of new materials and technologies towards emerging flexible sensors.",

abstract="In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT), which aims to achieve ubiquitous communication among a large number of resource constraint embedded devices, has emerged as a new paradigm in the field of wireless communications. Enabling the IoT essentially requires thousands of low-power and low cost embedded devices to be efficiently and seamlessly interconnected. Consequently, routing protocols play a crucial role in providing the interoperability for IoT components. In order to turn IoT into reality, IETF has standardized the IPv6 Routing Protocols for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). As the pervasiveness of RPL increases, a comprehensive survey of RPL is crucial to pave the way for researchers to understand and contribute in the relevant research area of RPL. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive study of RPL protocol as well as its latest and standardized addition, i.e., point-to-point RPL (P2P-RPL). Specifically, this paper focuses on performance evaluations, research challenges and envisioned opportunities of RPL. In addition, we also introduce a NS-3 framework design of RPL and P2P-RPL protocols. Furthermore, extensive simulation studies are conducted across various scenarios to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of RPL and P2P-RPL protocols. Moreover, research gaps and challenges facing in RPL and P2P-RPL protocols are also addressed. Finally, we summarize the paper by providing valuable insights of enabling technologies and suggestions for future research.",

abstract="Cryptographic algorithms rely on the strengths of all their fundamental components and expect them to be harmonious in accomplishing desired levels of security in applications. In order for a security solution to be sophisticated and to provide high security (measured in terms of the security goals it satisfies), the solution needs to typically involve complex mathematical operations and/or multiple stages of operation. While these might offer increased security, such solutions might not be applicable to all systems. We refer to resource-constrained wireless networks, such as radio frequency identification and wireless body area networks, where the resources available on-chip are often decided by the balance between device costs, requirements of longevity and usability. The constraints, thus, require designing solutions that use simple logical operations and are based on reuse of functions, while introducing sufficient unpredictability to increase security. In this paper, we present a key management and message signature generation scheme called HiveSec, whose design is inspired by the symmetry in beehives and the nature of bee swarms, and which offers security through unpredictability and reduced resource usage. We validate our work through simulation studies and security analysis.",

abstract="Information systems are very crucial in today's organizations, and hence the selection of the right system has become a very critical decision. As time has progressed, with new issues affecting the supply chain and the performance metrics being continually rewritten, the responsibility of the information systems has increased manifold. Nowadays, information systems are expected to perform a number of functions such as information security, big data handling, green supply chain and risk management and thus the basic problem of system selection is now more complex. Also, adding to the complexity is the fact that these new issues are interdependent and most of the times influence other issues in a variety of direct or indirect ways. This study addresses this problem by proposing a new model for information system selection by incorporating the latest trends in the supply chain. It also proposes an integrated methodology, to solve such a problem where interdependence between criteria exists. The advantages of this methodology over other existing techniques are delinking the evaluation of interdependent criteria weights from performance evaluation, flexibility of inputs, ability to handle vagueness and uncertainty in judgements. The methodology is illustrated using a numerical example.",

We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?",

abstract="In the Internet of Things (IoT), data-producing entities sense their environment and transmit these observations to a data processing platform for further analysis. Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making. To show the strengths of the platform, two use cases are detailed and thoroughly evaluated.",

abstract="Advances in human-centric technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), application-oriented sensing and smart home, along with recent developments in internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) networks are enabling the design and development of a smarter home with cognitive intelligence. In this paper, we first investigate the integration of smart home and botanical IoT for creating a better living environment to increase people's quality of life. First, we point out that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment, while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the affective interaction between greeneries and home users. It is foreseeable that the emotion-aware capability of smart home 2.0 will bring more intelligent and interactive healthcare applications for urban residents in the future.",

journal="The Journal of Supercomputing",
year="2016",
month="Mar",
day="02",
abstract="In this paper, we proposed an secure IoT framework to ensure an End-To-End security from an IoT application to IoT devices. The proposed IoT framework consists of the IoT application, an IoT broker and the IoT devices. The IoT devices can be deployed along a board line or a boundary of the area of IoT broker. The IoT broker manages their own devices and aggregates their sensing data. The IoT application provides users with IoT services. To use the IoT services, it needs to access to sensing data. Especially, the case of real-time healthcare services should consider intermediate security issues because medical information of patients is one of very sensitive privacy information. However, most of IoT protocols such as CoAP and MQTT have no concern about the End-To-End security, they only depended on the security of DTLS. Therefore, we proposed a new IoT framework to satisfy the End-To-End security feature under the CoAP communication. The proposed framework encrypts sensitive data by a symmetric encryption and an attribute-based encryption for efficiencies of communication and computation costs. In addition, each IoT device has a unique identification used as one of their attributes. Consequently, although the IoT broker is one of the intermediate nodes, it decrypts and shows data only if it satisfies all attributes.",

abstract="In a world that is becoming more `networked' than ever, especially on the personal-everyday level---with for example digital media pervading our lives and the Internet of Things now being on the rise---we need to increasingly account for `networked realities'. But are we as human beings actually well-equipped enough, epistemologically speaking, to do so? Multiple approaches within the philosophy of technology suggest our usage of technologies to be in the first instance oriented towards efficiency and the achievement of goals. We thereby neglect the actual systemic, networked nature of technology, or its wider impacts. With regard to the pressing issue of how to cross the `gap' between these two `modes,' the paper at hand engages with the work of Gregory Bateson, reading him as a philosopher of technology. Bateson's notions of ``conscious purpose'' and ``learning'' offer excellent tools to understand our predicament of living in a networked world but being partly unable to sufficiently grasp and come to terms with this situation. Moreover, as the article endeavors to demonstrate, Bateson's thought is to be cast as a crucial addition to the body of theory being developed in the philosophy of technology.",

However, it is critical to analyze and evaluate these algorithms to examine their capabilities. This paper provides a thorough investigation of the randomness of ciphertext obtained from Simeck, Kasumi, DES and AES. The design of our randomness analysis is based on five metrics implemented following the guidance of the NIST statistical test suite for cryptographic applications. This analysis also provides performance and power consumption evaluations for the selected cryptographic algorithms using different platforms and measures. Results from the evaluation reveal that lightweight algorithms have competitive randomness levels, lower processing time and lower power consumption when compared to conventional algorithms.",

Legal analysis of the depicted futures showed the shortcomings of the current legal framework in being able to provide adequate privacy protection in the AmI environment. In this paper, the authors, building upon their involvement in SWAMI research as well as the further advancement of EU privacy analysis, identify various outstanding issues regarding the legal framework that still need to be resolved in order to deal with AmI in an equitable and efficacious way.

First, it will show that this technological transition---which, however, is unfinished and is seen to be in continuity with the so-called ``third industrial revolution''---cannot be interpreted with reference to a deterministic approach. It can be analysed more usefully as a range of decisions affecting the industrial policies of national states, the conception and design of machines, their adoption in production processes and finally their use by operators. Second, certain aspects of Industry 4.0 of special concern in terms of organisation of work processes will be analysed on various scales (from inter-company transactions to the specific tasks of individual workers). Finally, we will explain various hypotheses that social and economic research is developing with regard to the new technologies' controversial effects on employment.",

abstract="The IoT domain is characterized by many applications that require low-bandwidth communications over a long range, at a low cost and at low power. Low power wide area networks (LPWANs) fulfill these requirements by using sub-GHz radio frequencies (typically 433 or 868 MHz) with typical transmission ranges in the order of 1 up to 50 km. As a result, a single base station can cover large areas and can support high numbers of connected devices (>1000 per base station). Notorious initiatives in this domain are LoRa, Sigfox and the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah (or ``HaLow'') standard. Although these new technologies have the potential to significantly impact many IoT deployments, the current market is very fragmented and many challenges exists related to deployment, scalability, management and coexistence aspects, making adoption of these technologies difficult for many companies. To remedy this, this paper proposes a conceptual framework to improve the performance of LPWAN networks through in-network optimization, cross-technology coexistence and cooperation and virtualization of management functions. In addition, the paper gives an overview of state of the art solutions and identifies open challenges for each of these aspects.",

abstract="The implementation of cyber-physical and similar systems depends on prevailing social and economic conditions. It is here argued that, if the effect of these technologies is to be benign, the current neo-liberal economy must change to a radically more cooperative model. In this paper, economy change means a thorough change to a qualitatively different kind of economy. It is contrasted with economic change, which is the kind of minor change usually considered in mainstream discourse. The importance of language is emphasised, including that of techno-optimism and that of economic conservatism. Problems of injustice, strife, and ecological overload cannot be solved by conventional growth together with technical efficiency gains. Rather, a change is advocated from economics-as-usual to a broader concept, oikonomia (root-household management), which takes into account all that contributes to a good life, including what cannot be represented quantitatively. Some elements of such a broader economy (work; basic income; asset and income limits) are discussed. It is argued that the benefits of technology can be enhanced and the ills reduced in such an economy. This is discussed in the case of cyber-physical systems under the headings employment, security, standards and oligopoly, and energy efficiency. The paper concludes that such systems, and similar technological developments, cannot resolve the problems of sustainability within an economy-as-usual model. If, however, there is the will to create a cooperative and sustainable economy, technology can contribute significantly to the resolution of present problems.",

abstract="Real-time manufacturing data plays more and more important roles in today's competitive manufacturing industry; however, many enterprises are still troubled by the lack of this timely, accurate, and consistent manufacturing data as there are no effective data collecting and process methods. The hysteretic and unmatched information flows lead to great opacity and uncertainty for production management. This paper thereby proposes a comprehensive real-time data-driven monitoring method in job-shop floor based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to address these issues. Firstly, a RFID configuration strategy is put forward including both RFID tag and device configuration schemas. The essence of RFID applications in job-shop floor is revealed too. Next, different levels of data collecting and monitoring models are established one by one, from single RFID reader level to process and process flow levels, wherein different types of state blocks are deployed to a decomposed process/process flow, generating a series of continuous event-driven data collecting units (EDCUs), which not only specify how to collect real-time on-site data but also point out what data should be collected. Then, three data processing methods are presented for different situations such as data preprocessing, fusion, and exception handling. Finally, a use case of a typical part is studied based on a prototype system which demonstrates how to use the proposed models and methods to monitor the production process of the part in job-shop floor and shows their feasibility simultaneously.",

pages="171--201",
abstract="Data mining in non-stationary data streams is particularly relevant in the context of Internet of Things and Big Data. Its challenges arise from fundamentally different drift types violating assumptions of data independence or stationarity. Available methods often struggle with certain forms of drift or require unavailable a priori task knowledge. We propose the Self-Adjusting Memory (SAM) model for the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm. SAM-kNN can deal with heterogeneous concept drift, i.e., different drift types and rates, using biologically inspired memory models and their coordination. Its basic idea is to have dedicated models for current and former concepts used according to the demands of the given situation. It can be easily applied in practice without meta parameter optimization. We conduct an extensive evaluation on various benchmarks, consisting of artificial streams with known drift characteristics and real-world datasets. We explicitly add new benchmarks enabling a precise performance analysis on multiple types of drift. Highly competitive results throughout all experiments underline the robustness of SAM-kNN as well as its capability to handle heterogeneous concept drift. Knowledge about drift characteristics in streaming data is not only crucial for a precise algorithm evaluation, but it also facilitates the choice of an appropriate algorithm on real-world applications. Therefore, we additionally propose two tests, able to determine the type and strength of drift. We extract the drift characteristics of all utilized datasets and use it for our analysis of the SAM in relation to other methods.",

abstract="Industrial control systems (ICS), such as smart grid systems, are frequently composed of hundreds of devices distributed over a large geographic area. While mobile applications have been used with good success in managing ICSs, traditional methods of distributing applications (e.g., app stores) are not well suited to the task of discovering, distributing, and building human machine interfaces (HMIs) for ICS, as the highly individualized and often proprietary individual components of ICSs have vastly different interfaces leading to a need to download hundreds of applications. We propose the No Effort Rapid Development (NERD) middleware framework to address the challenges of in-field HMI discovery, provisioning, communication, and co-evolution with related ICSs. Middleware services offer the ability to simplify on-demand HMI distribution and operation of ICSs. NERD leverages existing ICS device-markers (e.g., QR-codes or RFID tags) or Bluetooth low-energy protocols for rapid cyber-physical discovery and provisioning of HMIs in the field. Device-markers and Bluetooth low-energy protocols have a very limited data capacity and transmission speed, and to achieve on-device storage of HMIs, we propose using a compact data-driven domain-specific language that emphasizes data sources and sinks between the HMI and IC.",

abstract="The advent of sensing and communication technologies represents the next step in the evolution of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and future applications. Future WSNs systems demand that connected devices could be able to work autonomously, while surfing on-line generated data and process them for self-decision making. Accordingly, we propose a cognitive Information-Centric Sensor Network (ICSN) framework. The fundamentals of cognition in ICSN can be recognized as a promising direction in addressing opportunities and challenges posed by the needs of WSNs. Nevertheless, these fundamental concepts could be difficult to implement due to the wide spectrum of tasks to be covered from the perspective of each device in the WSN. Consequently, we propose the use of Cognitive Nodes (CNs) in typical sensor networks to provide intelligent information processing and knowledge-based services to the end-users. The CNs act on queries from the end-user, containing information about the nature of the request, without the need to modify and/or change any component at the end nodes from where data is collected. We present the detailed architecture and deployment strategy of the cognitive inspired framework that learns and exploits an expanded network information from relays and clustered sensors. Extensive simulation results show that in a network with randomly deployed sensor nodes, CNs can be strategically deployed at pre-determined positions, to ensure that end-user's Quality of Information (QoI) requirements are met, even under heavy traffic conditions and extensive packets' payloads. This shows the potential use of ICSN framework in producing the future cognitive applications, while catering to user-desired information quality.",

abstract="The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where High-Performance Computing solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. However, these systems are either memoryless or computational inefficient. Therefore, keeping in view the aforementioned needs, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that enhances the working of traditional MapReduce by incorporating parallel processing algorithm. Moreover, complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed parallel processing algorithm. The proposed system architecture both read and writes operations that enhance the efficiency of the Input/Output operation. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce. MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes to generate and process graphs with near real-time. Moreover, the system is evaluated in terms of efficiency by considering the system throughput and processing time. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient.",

abstract="Data collection is one of the fundamental functions in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Different from a typical WSN with only a single and stationary sink, this paper considers a scenario with multiple mobile sinks. The motivation is for a WSN to support future applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT). In this case, a WSN requires abilities to deliver sensing results to multiple users roaming in the network. There are two difficulties in this problem: sink mobility and multiple sinks. Since sinks are mobile, data delivery paths need to be updated frequently, which causes huge maintenance cost. To resolve this problem, we propose a hop-count-based architecture together with an efficient mobility management scheme. On the other side, sensing results from a large number of sensors are delivered to multiple sinks, which causes lots of packet transmissions. To reduce transmission cost, the concepts of multicast and data aggregation are integrated and applied. We first prove that a distributed multicast decision is a NP-hard problem and then propose a heuristic solution. Afterward, we further merge data aggregation into multicast and propose a distributed many-to-many aggregation scheme. Simulations are constructed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. The results show that both the proposed multicast scheme and many-to-many aggregation scheme can efficiently reduce transmission cost and energy when delivering data to multiple mobile sinks.",

abstract="In energy harvesting wireless sensor networks, the sensors are able to harvest energy from the environment to recharge their batteries and thus prolong indefinitely their activities. Widely used energy harvesting systems are based on solar cells, which are predictable (i.e., their energy production can be predicted in advance). However, since the energy production of solar cells is not constant during the day, and it is null at night time, these systems require algorithms able to balance the energy consumption and production of the sensors. In this framework, we approach the design of a scheduling algorithm for the sensors that selects among a set of available tasks for the sensors (each assigned with a given quality of service), in order to keeping the sensors energy neutral, i.e., the energy produced during a day exceeds the energy consumed in the same time frame, while improving the overall quality of service. The algorithm solves an optimization problem by using a greedy approach that can be easily implemented on low-power sensors. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach is able to improve the quality of the overall scheduling plan of all networked sensors and that it actually maintains them energy neutral.",

year="2017",
month="Nov",
day="25",
abstract="In the big data era, the volume of streaming data produced by sensor networks is staggeringly large that enables business intelligence to make well-informed decisions on emerging modern applications. Performing the data analytics and query processing over the fast arriving data streams is a tedious process. The semantic annotation of the data stream provides a high-level description, and a semantic context supports intelligent querying and data analytics. This paper presents a framework called SEmantic Annotation over Summarized sensOr Data stReam (SEASOR) that includes summarization, semantic annotation, and query processing that facilitates sensor data stream analytics. The summarization merges these types of stream values to increase the query performance and decrease the memory space. The semantic annotation is scripted with the help of application-dependent base ontology that extends the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology. The annotation of the sensor stream provides detailed descriptions for the observation of sensors using the base ontology, and it divides the streaming sensor data into several subsets according to the sensing features. The domain model enables the query processor to access the relevant results via an annotated Resource Description Framework (RDF). The query processor uses the extended SPARQL (Cs-SPARQL) to access only the relatively small subset via an annotated RDF file and allows extending the query processing to support windows and the parallel processing of data streams. The experimental results prove that the proposed SEASOR provides timely answers to the user queries and achieves better performance in terms of result accuracy by 95{\%}.",

However, it would be a heavy burden for teachers who do it by themselves, and traditional assist of video techniques is quite expensive and inconvenient for ordinary learners. Therefore, in this paper, we apply sensors within the smart phone to follow the performance of dance trainers and estimate the correctness of motion gesture and rhythm management by measuring the similarity between the motion data of trainers and the standard data with a dynamic time warping based algorithm. And we propose an automatic grading system to assess users' performances, including the comprehensive evaluation grade as well as the rhythm situation in each part. We apply our solution in the real world practice and compare its results with those that given by experts. According to the results of our experiments, this scheme is able to judge the dancing practice quite accurately and is accepted and confirmed by teachers and experts in dance field.

Therefore, this study reviewed the deployment mechanisms which have been used in WSN systematically.

abstract="For purposes of re-configurability and flexibility, a few control data are extracted from manufacturing data generated from a production line in a smart factory. A production manager can rearrange those control data selected from the manufacturing data to formulate the mission of a production line. All related data are saved in a cloud storage after being verified by a security mechanism. They can be accessed only with permission. Since the structures of control data and manufacturing data are different, they are saved in various databases. However, accessing different databases results in additional communication cost, and the data-save performance will be decreased simultaneously. The production line setting may be changed based on the mission of the received orders, so the control data will be modified. It costs huge communication overhead if the cloud storage queries the control data for each request. In this paper, we propose two cache-based mechanisms, termed laziness approach and flow-based update (FBU) approach, to reduce the cost of verifying the save permission. The laziness approach gets the corresponding control data when the received data can not be matched to the information in the cache. The update process of the FBU approach is similar to that of the laziness, but the FBU downloads the entire control data of the specific production line. According to our analysis results, both mechanisms provide better performance than that of on-demand approach in terms of data-save process. In the worst case analysis, the FBU approach only needs a half cost of that required by the laziness approach. Moreover, the optimal cache size is inversely proportional to the stability of the production line setting, and we also suggest an optimal setting of the cache size.",

However, static techniques cannot provide resistance to recent attacks e.g. the latest Heartbleed bug, and the recent high profile glibc attack on Linux operating system. In this research, we have designed and implemented a lightweight Linux kernel security module for IoT devices that is  scalable enough to monitor multiple applications in the kernel space.

abstract="Wireless video applications for Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) are expanding into a multitude of new services. In the example of cloud processing for visual object detection, a camera is connected to the cloud via a local server and a data network, allowing the processing load to be handled in a distributed manner. This service model heavy taxes the data network with potentially unneeded traffic, thus degrading the overall quality of service for all users on the network. Edge computing techniques mitigate the degradation of service quality by partially processing the sensor data at the local server before the data is transmitted to the cloud. This is done according to the level of interest of the captured data which is categorized by machine learning algorithms. However, conventional edge computing is not optimally efficient as further recognition attributes of the captured object data are not considered. This paper presents a model that adds control of the camera video rate by considering the attributes of captured object. We then investigate cost trade-offs using dynamic programming, and evaluates the behavior of proposed method under wireless channel condition using NS-3 simulations. Our results show that by adding intelligent adaptive video rate control to the cloud processing of video data capture can reduce overall system power use while improving system efficiency and subsequently network throughput.",

abstract="Recently, privacy concerns about data collection have received an increasing amount of attention. In data collection process, a data collector (an agency) assumed that all respondents would be comfortable with submitting their data if the published data was anonymous. We believe that this assumption is not realistic because the increase in privacy concerns causes some respondents to refuse participation or to submit inaccurate data to such agencies. If respondents submit inaccurate data, then the usefulness of the results from analysis of the collected data cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, we note that the level of anonymity (i.e., k-anonymity) guaranteed by an agency cannot be verified by respondents since they generally do not have access to all of the data that is released. Therefore, we introduce the notion of k                                                  i                -anonymity, where k                                                  i                . is the level of anonymity preferred by each respondent i.

abstract="The paper focuses on concerns and legal challenges brought on by the use of algorithms. A particular class of algorithms that augment or replace analysis and decision-making by humans, i.e. data analytics and machine learning, is under scrutiny. Taking into account Balkin's work on ``the laws of an algorithmic society'', attention is drawn to obligations of transparency, matters of due process, and accountability. This US-centric analysis on drawbacks and loopholes of current legal systems is complemented with the analysis of norms and principles of the EU data protection law, or ``GDPR''. The aim is twofold. On the one hand, the intent is to shed light on some crucial differences between the US and EU law on the regulation of algorithmic operators, both public and private. Whereas, in the USA, scholars debate whether and to what extent new duties and responsibilities of algorithmic operators, e.g. information fiduciaries, have to amend the current framework of self-regulation and light government---as shown by the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy report from November 2016---in EU law much of the new duties and responsibilities of algorithmic operators have been passed upon them as data controllers. Whether such approaches will successfully tackle the normative challenges of the algorithmic society is, on the other hand, an open issue that will likely represent the main topic of debate over the next years. Disagreement may concern: (i) the terms framing the legal question in e.g. statistical purposes of the data processing; (ii) how such terms are related to each other in legal reasoning (e.g. a right to explanation as valid law in the EU); and (iii) legal hard cases that will increasingly have to do with the principles that are at stake also but not only in data protection (e.g. informational self-determination). By entrusting such legal hard cases to algorithms, or some sort of smart artificial agent, humans still bear full responsibility for the judgment of what is socially, ethically, and legally ``plain'' and ``hard'' in social affairs. The balance between delegation of decisions to algorithms and non-delegation will be the leitmotiv of the algorithmic society. Since the devil is in the detail, the current paper is devoted to some of them.",

To deal with the crowded spectrum, nodes must use the channels more judiciously and be able to adapt by detecting and switching to the most available channel. The SAS middleware that we have developed, is a self-adaptive spectrum management middleware for wireless sensor networks that enhances single-frequency MAC protocols with multi-frequency capability, without any change in hardware. It allows a single-frequency MAC protocol, like B-MAC, to automatically adapt to the least congested physical channel at runtime. SAS supports a combination of receiver-initiated and sender-initiated schemes to decide when to switch the channel and which channel to switch to. We have implemented the B-MAC protocol integrated with SAS in TinyOS 2.1 on TelosB sensor devices and evaluated its performance on the conditions of varied data flows and the interference produced by a jammer. The results demonstrate that the integrated B-MAC protocol outperforms B-MAC in terms of packet reception ratio, system throughput, average packet delay, and energy consumption.",

abstract="How does an institutionally-contested business model originate, survive, and grow? What roles do institutional entrepreneurs play in the different stages of evolution of the business model? In the past four decades, the fabless model (which allows a semiconductor firm to operate without a fabrication unit) has changed the global semiconductor industry with significant impact in the Asian regions. In this paper, we trace the origin and evolution of the fabless model through a mixed-method approach, utilizing historic milestones, events, and financial data of publicly-traded semiconductor firms. We have applied theories of institutional entrepreneurship and adaptive ecosystem to identify four stages in this history: differentiation, mobilization, legitimization, and symbiosis to conceptualize the fabless model's co-creation and co-evolution. Our findings indicate that actions of institutional entrepreneurs within specific temporal locations and structures played a crucial role in the fabless business model's origin and co-evolution.",

The most common form of interaction between people and devices is using the device interfaces (buttons, touch screens, etc.). However, there are other ways of interacting such as Smartphone's, which are used to communicate users with electronic devices. Normally, the user selects the commands or actions from an application installed on the Smartphone. This application uses the Smartphone communication hardware elements (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) to send the selected commands to the electronic device. Native mobile applications are platform-dependent (Android, Symbian, etc.) and are developed for multiple platform usually have high development costs. We present a proposal that allows web applications to access the device communication hardware elements, making possible the communication with physical devices.",

The solution proposed in this paper is based on Stack4Things, an IoT-Cloud framework to manage edge nodes such as mobiles, smart objects, network devices, workstations, as a whole, a computing infrastructure allowing to provide resources on-demand, as services, to end users.

abstract="We propose an interdisciplinary framework for time series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection by combining concepts from Koopman operator theory, machine learning, and linear systems and control theory. At the core of this framework is nonlinear dynamic generative modeling of time series using the Koopman operator which is an infinite-dimensional but linear operator. Rather than working with the underlying nonlinear model, we propose two simpler linear representations or model forms based on Koopman spectral properties. We show that these model forms are invariants of the generative model and can be readily identified directly from data using techniques for computing Koopman spectral properties without requiring the explicit knowledge of the generative model. We also introduce different notions of distances on the space of such model forms which is essential for model comparison/clustering. We employ the space of Koopman model forms equipped with distance in conjunction with classical machine learning techniques to develop a framework for automatic feature generation for time series classification. The forecasting/anomaly detection framework is based on using Koopman model forms along with classical linear systems and control approaches. We demonstrate the proposed framework for human activity classification, and for time series forecasting/anomaly detection in power grid application.",

abstract="In current times, multimedia application includes integrated sensors, mobile networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services. In IoT services, if more devices are connected without much constrains, the problem of security, trust and privacy remain a challenge. For multimedia communications through Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), sensor nodes transmit confidential data to the gateway nodes via public channels. In such an environment, the security remains a serious issue from past many years. Only few works are available to support secure multimedia communications performed in IoT-enabled WSNs. Among the few works, Kumari and Om recently proposed an authentication protocol for multimedia communications in IoT-enabled WSNs, which is applicable in coal mine for safety monitoring. The authors claimed in their work that their contributory protocol strongly withstands several security threats such as, user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack, sensor node anonymity issue and others technical design issues. However, this article proved that Kumari and Om's protocol has some design flaws and is susceptible to various security attacks including, user and sensor node impersonation attacks. As a remedy, a robust authentication protocol using smartcard is constructed to solve the security issues found in Kumari and Om's protocol. The proof of correctness of mutual authentication is performed using the BAN logic model. In addition, our further security investigation claimed strong protection against known security attacks. Our protocol is analyzed comprehensively and compared against the similar protocols and the results showed that it is efficient and robust than earlier protocols.",

The paradigm breaking vision is introduced through a set of its key characteristics. The paper then proceeds with addressing the implications and requirements for implementing the Physical Internet vision as a means to meet the grand challenge. It concludes with a call for further research, innovation, and development to really shape and assess the vision and, much more important, to give it flesh through real initiatives and projects so as to really influence in a positive way the collective future.

abstract="Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals often consist of unwanted noises and speckles. In order to remove the noises, various image processing filters are used in various studies. In this paper, FIR and IIR filters are initially used to remove the linear and nonlinear delay present in the input ECG signal. In addition, filters are used to remove unwanted frequency components from the input ECG signal. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the features present in the input ECG signal. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is widely used for pattern recognition. However, traditional SVM method does not applicable to compute different characteristics of the features of data sets. In this paper, we use SVM model with a weighted kernel function method to classify more features from the input ECG signal. SVM model with a weighted kernel function method is significantly identifies the Q wave, R wave and S wave in the input ECG signal to classify the heartbeat level such as Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) and Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs). The performance of the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is comparatively analyzed with other machine learning approaches such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with multilayer perceptron (MLP), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM). The calculated RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R2 and Q2 for the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is low when compared with other approaches such as LDA with MLP, and PCA with SVM and LDA with SVM. Finally, Sensitivity, Specificity and Mean Square Error (MSE) are calculated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with an enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.",

Intelligent fault diagnosis is recognized as an important and promising approach in using these data, because it can provide accurate diagnosis and adjust to different deployed environments. In this study, intelligent fault diagnosis approaches for real machine data sets are comprehensively investigated. First, support vector machine (SVM) and popular neural network approaches are implemented and compared. Results show that while the neural network-based method is very efficient in many high-dimensional applications, such as video, SVM performs well enough for intelligent fault diagnosis. Second, the relation between the number of samples and the efficiency of diagnosis are studied, Findings indicate that a small number of samples can produce an optimal result. Furthermore, accuracy does not increase with training data because of the inherent fuzziness of machine monitoring data. Finally, the accuracy of conditioning and diagnosis is demonstrated for several kinds of machine data.",

Thus, it is essential to ensure that only authorized shareholders can access the transmitted information. Authentication and key agreement protocols are developed to ensure confidentiality and security in IOT. We design a biometric based authentication and key agreement protocol for WSNs. To analyze the security of the proposed protocol, we use formal security proof, which shows that an attacker has a negligible probability of breaking the protocol security. We also use the BAN logic technique to show the correctness of mutual authentication. Additionally, we adopt an informal analysis to discuss the resistance of proposed scheme against various possible attacks on authentication protocols. Additionally, through the comparison of computational efficiency and security attributes with recent results, proposed protocol seems to be more appropriate for WSNs.",

abstract="CyberManufacturing system (CMS) is a vision for future manufacturing systems. The concept delineates a vision of advanced manufacturing system integrated with technologies such as Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Sensors Network and Machine Learning. As a result, cyber-attacks such as Stuxnet attack will increase along with growing simultaneous connectivity. Now, cyber-physical attacks are new and unique risks to CMSs and modern cyber security countermeasure is not enough. To learn this new vulnerability, the cyber-physical attacks is defined via a taxonomy under the vision of CMS. Machine learning on physical data is studied for detecting cyber-physical attacks. Two examples were developed with simulation and experiments: 3D printing malicious attack and CNC milling machine malicious attack. By implementing machine learning methods in physical data, the anomaly detection algorithm reached 96.1{\%} accuracy in detecting cyber-physical attacks in 3D printing process; random forest algorithm reached on average 91.1{\%} accuracy in detecting cyber-physical attacks in CNC milling process.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks have recently been extensively researched due to the flexibility and cost savings they provide. One of the most promising applications of sensor networks is human health monitoring: wireless sensors are placed on the human body to form a wireless body network where the sensor node can continuously monitor real-time physiological parameters or human activities (motion detection). However, along with the flexibility, many problems arise due to a number of factors, including the bad quality of transmission media and the scarcity of resources. Moreover, sensor networks have different characteristics such as a variety of devices, different generated data, etc. From a quality of service (QoS) point of view, the healthcare domain can be seen as a real-time application demand to consider application requirements. Healthcare domains principally have stringent delay and loss requirements. Thus, considering different capabilities and ensuring time data delivery become necessary. Because wireless body area networks (WBAN) deal with human life, any delayed or lost data can endanger the user's life. This paper proposes a differentiated traffic and scheduling scheme for WBAN. It is based on patients' data classification and prioritization according to their current status and diseases. Through queue scheduling and path choice issues, the urgent data are delivered on time to provide a QoS guarantee for WBAN. Finally, it is shown that the proposed scheme is efficient for timely data transfer in WBAN.",

Quite a few distinct features of the mobility presented in context of IoT/ITS are needed to be considered. Among others, the resource-constrained mobile nodes are likely to move together with the vehicles or the human bodies in IoT/ITS. In this paper, a network-based mobility management scheme which supports group mobility to provide globally ubiquitous IoT/ITS services is proposed.

abstract="A smart home is a home environment enriched with sensing, actuation, communication and computation capabilities which permits to adapt it to inhabitants preferences and requirements. Establishing a proper strategy of actuation on the home environment can require complex computational tasks on the sensed data. This is the case of activity recognition, which consists in retrieving high-level knowledge about what occurs in the home environment and about the behaviour of the inhabitants. The inherent complexity of this application domain asks for tools able to properly support the design and implementation phases. This paper proposes a framework for the design and implementation of smart home applications focused on activity recognition in home environments. The framework mainly relies on the Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE) architecture offering basic abstraction entities which easily allow to design and implement Smart Home applications. CASE is a three layered architecture which exploits the distributed multi-agent paradigm and the cloud technology for offering analytics services. Details about how to implement activity recognition onto the CASE architecture are supplied focusing on the low-level technological issues as well as the algorithms and the methodologies useful for the activity recognition. The effectiveness of the framework is shown through a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of a person in a home environment.",

abstract="Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an important technique used for automatic identification and data capture. In recent years, low-cost RFID tags have been used in many open-loop applications beyond supply chain management, such as the tagging of the medicine, clothes, and belongings after the point of sales. At the same time, with the development of semiconductor industry, handheld terminals and mobile phones are becoming RFID-enabled. Unauthorized mobile RFID readers could be abused by the malicious hackers or curious common people. Even for authorized RFID readers, the ownership of the reader can be transferred and the owners of the authorized mobile reader may not be always reliable. The authorization and authentication of the mobile RFID readers need to take stronger security measures to address the privacy or security issues that may arise in the emerging open-loop applications. In this paper, the security demands of RFID tags in emerging open-loop applications are summarized, and two example protocols for authorization, authentication and key establishment based on symmetric cryptography are presented. The proposed protocols adopt a timed-session-based authorization scheme, and all reader-to-tag operations are authorized by a trusted third party using a newly defined class of timed sessions. The output of the tags is randomized to prevent unauthorized tracking of the RFID tags. An instance of the protocol A is implemented in 0.13-$\mu$m CMOS technology, and the functions are verified by field programmable gate array. The baseband consumes 44.0 $\mu$W under 1.08 V voltage and 1.92 MHz frequency, and it has 25,067 gate equivalents. The proposed protocols can successfully resist most security threats toward open-loop RFID systems except physical attacks. The timing and scalability of the two protocols are discussed in detail.",

We determine that research about political interaction is needed to design new standards and regulations for GL. We also recommend that this work be extended by behavioural research to both identify factors that influence society's sustainable behaviour and determine whether the current digitisation of society leads to more sustainable transport. In addition, this paper provides an overview of types of software applications that may be beneficial to GL. These benefits usually relate to the strategic management of freight transport and supply chains and the provision of software for executing or monitoring passenger transport. As such, further research on sustainability measures is also needed to identify important sustainable indicators in transport. Existing reviews mostly concentrate on either a specific logistics area or supply chain management; as far as we are aware, no studies focus on the use of ICT in GL at a superordinate level. This paper's holistic evaluation of the state of research in this underexplored area and its propositions for future research help to fill this gap in the literature.",

abstract="The many definitions of business models can be summarized into two distinct approaches, the static and the transformational. This paper proposes a third approach, namely a dynamic approach to business models and argues that the flexible and adaptive nature of business models can be developed further based on the industrial network approach. The business model is embedded in business contexts and business networks, and is dependent on changes in the business environment. Due to these mutual dependencies between business network actors, and in the pursuit of new capabilities and resources, the business model may also build on co-production, collectivity and sharing, and be utilized by the many actors embedded in value networks. This differs from the traditional view, in which companies create value independently of each other. A networked, flexible, and co-produced business model offers a novel tool for strategizing turbulent business environments.",

abstract="With the recent increased interest in atmospheric pollutants in South Korea, studies on the analysis and forecast of atmospheric pollution using Internet-of-Things technology have been actively conducted. To forecast atmospheric pollution, a multiple regression analysis technique based on statistical techniques, data mining, and an analysis technique combining time series models have typically been used. In terms of accuracy, however, multiple regression analysis is insufficient for analyzing atmospheric environment data in South Korea. In addition, although the time series analysis technique is appropriate for analyzing linear data, it is inappropriate for analyzing atmospheric environment data in South Korea, where linear and nonlinear data are mixed. Therefore, this study proposes a seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average--support vector machine (SARIMA--SVM) time series analysis algorithm, combining time series analysis and nonlinear analysis, for data analysis of atmospheric environment information and improvement of pollution forecast accuracy. The proposed algorithm analyzes the seasonality in environmental contamination by using the SARIMA model, and succeeds in improving accuracy in the contamination forecast through an analysis of linear and nonlinear characteristics by applying an SVM nonlinear regression model. A comparative assessment with the existing atmospheric contamination forecast algorithm was conducted as well. The assessment results show that the forecast accuracy of the proposed algorithm improved by 20.81{\%} for fine dust, and by 43.77{\%} for ozone, compared to the performance of the existing models.",

In addition, these solutions can potentially reduce the cost of providing healthcare in the context of the increasing demands of the aging populations in advanced economies. These solutions can also play an important part in intelligent environments, facilitating real-time data collection and input to enable various functionalities. However, there are several challenges regarding the development of mHealth solutions: the most important of these being privacy and data security. Furthermore, the use of cloud computing is becoming an option for the healthcare sector to store healthcare data; but storing data in the cloud raises serious concerns. This paper investigates how data are managed both on mHealth devices as well as in the cloud. Firstly, a detailed analysis of the entire mHealth domain is undertaken to determine domain-specific features and a taxonomy for mHealth, from which a set of security requirements are identified in order to develop a new information security framework. It then examines individual information security frameworks for mHealth devices and the cloud, noting similarities and differences. Furthermore, key mechanisms to implement the new framework are discussed and the new framework is then presented. Finally, the paper presents how the new framework could be implemented in order to develop an Advanced Digital Medical Platform.",

abstract="In conventional cloud computing technology, cloud resources are provided centrally by large data centers. For the exponential growth of cloud users, some applications, such as health monitoring and emergency response with the requirements of real-time and low-latency, cannot achieve efficient resource support. Therefore, fog computing technology has been proposed, where cloud services can be extended to the edge of the network to decrease the network congestion. In fog computing, the idle resources within many distributed devices can be used for providing services. An effective resource scheduling scheme is important to realize a reasonable management for these heterogeneous resources. Therefore, in this paper, a two-level resource scheduling model is proposed. In addition, we design a resource scheduling scheme among fog nodes in the same fog cluster based on the theory of the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which considers the diversity of different devices. MATLAB simulation results show that our scheme can reduce the service latency and improve the stability of the task execution effectively.",

In this context, the paper proposes the sink mobility and nodes heterogeneity aware cluster-based data aggregation algorithm (MHCDA) for efficient bandwidth utilization and an increase in network lifetime. The proposed algorithm uses a predefined region for the aggregation of packets at the cluster head for minimizing computation and communication cost. MHCDA exploits correlation of data packets generated by nodes with a variable packet generation rate to reduce energy consumption by 8.66 {\%}.

abstract="With the continued growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and its convergence with the cloud, numerous interoperable software are being developed for cloud. Therefore, there is a growing demand to maintain a better quality of software in the cloud for improved service. This is more crucial as the cloud environment is growing fast towards a hybrid model; a combination of public and private cloud model. Considering the high volume of the available software as a service (SaaS) in the cloud, identification of non-standard software and measuring their quality in the SaaS is an urgent issue. Manual testing and determination of the quality of the software is very expensive and impossible to accomplish it to some extent. An automated software defect detection model that is capable to measure the relative quality of software and identify their faulty components can significantly reduce both the software development effort and can improve the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a software defect detection model that can be used to identify faulty components in big software metric data. The novelty of our proposed approach is that it can identify significant metrics using a combination of different filters and wrapper techniques. One of the important contributions of the proposed approach is that we designed and evaluated a parallel framework of a hybrid software defect predictor in order to deal with big software metric data in a computationally efficient way for cloud environment. Two different hybrids have been developed using Fisher and Maximum Relevance (MR) filters with a Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based wrapper in the parallel framework. The evaluations are performed with real defect-prone software datasets for all parallel versions. Experimental results show that the proposed parallel hybrid framework achieves a significant computational speedup on a computer cluster with a higher defect prediction accuracy and smaller number of software metrics compared to the independent filter or wrapper approaches.",

abstract="The literature does not present integral solutions to allow using the same credential to access the smart meter and smart house from an electric utility and vice-versa. The main reason being the technology gap in the communication between the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and the Internet. The technology used in the Internet domain to communicate with Data Concentrators (DC) and the electric utility is more powerful than the technology used in the communication between smart meters and the DC, which is bandwidth limited and better suited to the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Therefore, we are proposing the use of Identity Management (IdM) and a key-based scheme to enable the integration of IoT and the Internet using the same credentials, without creating a security bottleneck in the communication. An additional security mechanism is provided in the smart house context to isolate the house from direct accesses from the Internet, though allowing the utility to reconfigure the electric power consumption profile to avoid a potential blackout, for instance. Our proposal includes multi-sensor anti-tampering techniques to provide physical protection to a smart meter, in conjunction with a multilevel integrity mechanism to provide logical protection to its resource-constrained microcontroller, given the smart meter is a key component to mitigate electricity consumption fraud. The prototype has shown that our proposal is feasible for protecting the smart house, smart meter and the end-to-end communication between smart meter or house and the utility.",

abstract="Wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) have become pervasive and are used in many embedded and intelligent systems. However, the complexity of applications based on these networks is limited due to lack of tools for designing distributed systems on top of WSANs. In this paper, we present how a system-level programming language, SystemJ, is used to develop a middleware-free Ambient Intelligence (AmI) system. The system consists of a combination of Internet-enabled stationary and mobile WSAN nodes, which resembles an Internet of Things scenario. A distributed warehouse monitoring and control scenario with collaborating stationary and mobile WSAN nodes is used as a motivating example designed and implemented in SystemJ. This example demonstrates the capabilities of SystemJ for designing distributed AmI systems with inherent support for reactivity and composition of concurrent behaviors based on a formal model of computation, without the need for any additional middleware. The approach is compared with existing software agent, robotic and WSAN middleware approaches in designing the same type of systems.",

abstract="Innovative growth of IoT Technology has enhanced the service delivery aspects of defence sector in terms of high-tech surveillance, and reliable defence mechanisms. Along with the sensing capability for ubiquitous events, IoT Technology provides means to deliver services in time sensitive and information intensive manner. In this paper, a framework for IoT based activity monitoring of defence personnel is presented to detect the precursors of suspiciousness in terms of information outflow that can compromise the national security. Though maintaining intellectual defence personnel remained a major area of concern for every nation, still investigating reports of recent terrorist attacks in different countries have discovered the number of suspicion factors from their daily activities. The work presented in this study focuses on these factors in terms of efficient monitoring of social activities and analyzing it over suspicious scale. Moreover, Suspicious Index (SI) is defined for every personnel on the basis of their activities that can compromise national security directly or indirectly. Furthermore, automated game theoretic decision making model is presented to aid the monitoring officials in suppressing the probability of information outflow. In order to validate the system, two types of evaluations are performed. In one case, an imitative environment is considered to monitor 10 college students' daily engagements for 7 days. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques of data assessment. In the second case, a mathematical evaluation for the game theoretic decision making is performed. Results in both cases show that the proposed model achieves better performance in efficient monitoring of suspicious activities and effective decision making.",

Given the continued integration of the Internet in many fields, Internet Plus is profoundly transforming and influencing a variety of traditional industries. Internet Plus has created conditions favorable for the transformation of earth observation and satellite navigation into an intelligent and real-time geospatial information service. The authors propose that in order to implement continuous, all-weather, all-terrain services for the specific purposes of each individual, it will be necessary to overcome the flaws in existing space-based information systems, such as limited regional coverage, slow response, and weak interoperability. Furthermore, to meet the Big Data Era's geospatial information service requirements, an ``Internet Plus Space-Based Information Service'' system, intrinsically linked to ground Internet networks, will have to be constructed. With reference to the developments of aerospace information technology, this paper discusses three levels of the proposed structure of the Internet Plus space-based information service system and ideas for its implementation. Finally, in recognition of the demands facing the Internet Plus space-based information service system, the prospects for geomatics and important supporting technologies are examined.",

abstract="In our high-tech society, the design process involves profound questions about the effects of the resulting goods, and the responsibilities of designers. In the philosophy of technology, effects of ``things'' on user experience and behaviour have been discussed in terms of the concept of technological mediation. Meanwhile, what we create has moved more and more towards services (processes) rather than products (things), in particular in the context of information services. The question is raised to what extent the concept of technological mediation is adequate to understand effects and responsibilities in information services as well. Therefore, this paper discusses differences between product aspects and service aspects of our creations, and evaluates the applicability of the concept of technological mediation to information services. Specific features of a notion of technological mediation for information services are highlighted, in particular with respect to the different relation between production and consumption. Finally, the paper focuses on the ethical consequences of service impact, and recommendations for service providers, especially in terms of the possibilities for second-order mediation by inviting users to change service properties.",

As these systems are ubiquitously deployed in different authentication and identification applications, inferring information about our behavior will be possible by monitoring our use of them. In order to provide privacy and security requirements of RFID users in novel authentication applications, lots of security schemes have been proposed which have tried to provide secure and untraceable communication for end-users. In this paper, we investigate the privacy of three RFID security schemes which have been proposed recently. For privacy analysis, we use the well-known RFID formal privacy model proposed by Ouafi and Phan. We show that all the studied protocols have some privacy drawbacks, making them vulnerable to various traceability attacks. Moreover, in order to overcome all the reported weaknesses and prevent the presented attacks, we apply some modifications in the structures of the studied protocols and propose an improved version of each one. Our analyses show that the modified protocols are more efficient than their previous versions and new modifications can omit all the existing weaknesses on the analyzed protocols. Finally, we compare the modified protocols with some new-found RFID authentication protocols in the terms of security and privacy.",

Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud integration seems to be one of the winning solutions in order to opportunely manage the proliferation of both data and devices. In this paper, following the idea to reuse as much tooling as possible, we propose, with regards to infrastructure management, to adopt a widely used and competitive framework for Infrastructure-as-a-Service such as OpenStack. Therefore, we describe approaches and architectures so far preliminary implemented for enabling Cloud-mediated interactions with droves of sensor- and actuator-hosting nodes by presenting Stack4Things, a framework for Sensing-and-Actuation-as-a-Service (SAaaS). In particular, starting from a detailed requirement analysis, in this work, we focus on the subsystems of Stack4Things devoted to resource control and management as well as on those related to the management and collection of sensing data. Several use cases are presented justifying how our proposed framework can be viewed as a concrete step toward the complete fulfillment of the SAaaS vision.",

abstract="On-line statistical and machine learning analytic tasks over large-scale contextual data streams coming from e.g., wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things environments, have gained high popularity nowadays due to their significance in knowledge extraction, regression and classification tasks, and, more generally, in making sense from large-scale streaming data. The quality of the received contextual information, however, impacts predictive analytics tasks especially when dealing with uncertain data, outliers data, and data containing missing values. Low quality of received contextual data significantly spoils the progressive inference and on-line statistical reasoning tasks, thus, bias is introduced in the induced knowledge, e.g., classification and decision making. To alleviate such situation, which is not so rare in real time contextual information processing systems, we propose a progressive time-optimized data quality-aware mechanism, which attempts to deliver contextual information of high quality to predictive analytics engines by progressively introducing a certain controlled delay. Such a mechanism progressively delivers high quality data as much as possible, thus eliminating possible biases in knowledge extraction and predictive analysis tasks. We propose an analytical model for this mechanism and show the benefits stem from this approach through comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative assessment with quality-unaware methods over real sensory multivariate contextual data.",

abstract="One of the critical requirement in managing security of any computing system is access control, which includes protection and access management to the available resources. This requirement becomes more strict especially in a distributed computing environment that consists of constrained devices such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M). New challenges in access control are identified in a system comprises a group of distributed multiple M2M gateways forming a so called M2M local cloud platform (Vallati et al. in Wirel Trans Commun 87(3):1071--1091, 2016). Scalability is obviously a necessity which is lacking in some existing access control system. In addition, flexibility in managing access from users or entity belonging to other authorization domains as well as delegating access right are not provided as an integrated features. Lately, the capability-based access control has been suggested as method to manage access for M2M as the key enabler of Internet of Things. In this paper, a capability based access control equipped with Elliptic Curve Cryptography based key management is proposed for the M2M local cloud platform. The feasibility of the proposed capability based access control and key management are tested by implementing them within the security manager that is part of the overall component of the platform architecture, and evaluating their performances by a series of experimentations.",

abstract="Smart buildings equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and meters are becoming more common. Large quantities of data are being collected by these devices. For a single building to benefit from its own collected data, it will need to wait for a long time to collect sufficient data to build accurate models to help improve the smart buildings systems. Therefore, multiple buildings need to cooperate to amplify the benefits from the collected data and speed up the model building processes. Apparently, this is not so trivial and there are associated challenges. In this paper, we study the importance of collaborative data analytics for smart buildings, its benefits, as well as presently possible models of carrying it out. Furthermore, we present a framework for collaborative fault detection and diagnosis as a case of collaborative data analytics for smart buildings. We also provide a preliminary analysis of the energy efficiency benefit of such collaborative framework for smart buildings. The result shows that significant energy savings can be achieved for smart buildings using collaborative data analytics.",

abstract="In this research, we propose virtual caregiver (VCareGiver), a virtual caregiver as a cyber-physical smart home (CPSH) companion to support the daily life activities of elderly people through their gestures. The CPSH will act as a virtual caregiver who will understand the need of an elderly person and be present with him/her ubiquitously at any time and at any location within his/her house. VCareGiver will help in solving two important problems. Firstly, a large population is at their old age who needs help in their daily chores, since the family members are unable to give full support (e.g. reminding the to-do list, maintaining appointments, taking medicine on right time, sending SMS, saving energy due to consumption of electricity, controlling home appliances, etc.) due to busy schedule. Secondly, due to the old age movement problem, they need support in doing activities through gesture. In this research, we want to test the viability of the virtual caregiver as a physical assistant. The gestures of an elderly subject in the physical world are recognized by a multi-sensory IoT-based framework that is passed to the CPSH, which analyses the gestures and generates a command to perform certain physical world activity and finally produce the visualization. A proof of concept CPSH has been implemented through the web, and smartphone based applications. More than 100 different gestures have been incorporated into the CPSH system through which different daily life activities can be performed. Initial test results are very encouraging and show the prospect of such virtual caregiver, which can revolutionize the quality of life of our prospective elderly generation.",

This study aims at interaction between persons under care and the system in various living spaces, as based on motion-sensing interaction, and the context-aware smart home care system is proposed. The system stores the required contexts in knowledge ontology, including the physiological information and environmental information of the person under care, as the database of decision. The motion-sensing device enables the person under care to interact with the system through gestures. By the inference mechanism of fuzzy theory, the system can offer advice and rapidly execute service, thus, implementing the EHA. In addition, the system is integrated with the functions of smart phone, tablet PC, and PC, in order that users can implement remote operation and share information regarding the person under care. The health care system constructed in this study enables the decision making system to probe into the health risk of each person under care; then, from the view of preventive medicine, and through a composing system and simulation experimentation, tracks the physiological trend of the person under care, and provides early warning service, thus, promoting smart home care.",

abstract="In recent years, wireless medical sensor networks meet the web to enable exciting healthcare applications that require data communication over the Internet. Often these applications suffer from data disclosure due to malicious users' activities. To prevent such data disclosure in the healthcare systems, many public key cryptographic techniques have been used. However, most of them are too expensive to implement in the web-enabled wireless medical sensor networks. In 2013, Xun et al. introduced a lightweight encryption algorithm to protect communication between the sensor node and the data servers. Their scheme is based on the Sharemind framework. However, Sharemind framework has a limitation on the number of data storage servers (ie., three servers only). In addition, Xun et al's scheme does not support privacy-preserving patient data analysis for distributed databases of different hospitals. In this paper, we introduce a new practical approach to prevent data disclosure from inside attack. Our new proposal is based on FairplayMP framework which enables programmers who are not experts in the theory of secure computation to implement such protocols. In addition, it support any number of n participants and is suitable for distributed environments. Moreover, in our new scheme, each sensor node needs only one secret key stored in advance to communicate with n different data servers, whereas three secret keys are embedded in advance into each sensor in order to communicate with three data servers in Xun et al's scheme.",

As a result of analysis, all the hypotheses were accepted; except for the one that call quality will have effects on perceived usefulness (H1-1), except for the one that social influence will have effects on user satisfaction (H7-2), except for the one that customer membership will have effects on perceived usefulness (H8-1), except for the one that social influence will have effects on perceived usefulness (H8-2). The results of this study provided practical guidelines to service providers through the causal relationship analysis of various variables affecting LTE services satisfaction and constant services.",

abstract="This work addresses the problem of generating and then recommending an artworks sequence for a group of visitors within a museum. Differently from a recommender system for an e-commerce application, the problem, here, is trying to maximize the satisfaction of the proposed recommendations, while taking into account an items' ordering that satisfies each group member during the sequence and the artworks locations in the museum. Moreover, since many visitors may not be able to visit every artwork, the recommender system should provide suggestions while satisfying temporal visit constraints. The problem formulation is discussed together with the characteristics of a feasible solution. An exact search algorithm from the literature is used to efficiently solve the problem and to define the prerequisites for the recommender system. Finally, we evaluate a prototype implementation with both an offline analysis and a pilot study in a simulated museum environment.",

abstract="In an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, service composition and collaboration among heterogeneous resources are required. Thus, an infrastructure that supports these requirements is an essential factor in a seamless service delivery. For these requirements, mobile devices should have multiple functions. However, the miniaturization of mobile devices is another requirement, and a trade-off between the two requirements is naturally generated. My previous study proposed the resource collaboration system that provides a service consisting of shareable resources in the surrounding area to solve the resource limitations of devices. Reducing the processing time for generating the recommendation and improving user satisfaction about the results are important factors, particularly for a small mobile device with limited resources. This study analyzes and classifies personal user preferences from resource usage history based on the Myers-Briggs type indicator. The study also proposes a method to recommend customized resources for classified user types. Results show that the proposed method reduces the recommendation time and increases user satisfaction.",

abstract="Wearable devices are examples of the Internet of Things, which often enable objects to exchange data with other connected devices, without requiring human intervention. Since quantum computers have been a potential threat to most of the public cryptographic systems, the data security has been the focuses of the users of wearable devices. Among public cryptographic systems, Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC) is one of the most popular candidates, which can resist quantum computer attacks. MPKC is based on a NP-hard problem, which includes Rainbow, UOV, enTTS schemes. We propose a novel architecture based on Rainbow scheme for wearable devices, which is one of the most efficient schemes of MPKC. In order to validate our design and verify its effectiveness, an experiment is carried out by using TSMC-0.18 $\mu$m standard cell CMOS Application Specific Integrated Circuit, which shows that the executing time of Rainbow is 3.8 ms and its area is 3500 gate equivalents. The results demonstrate that our design is well suit for wearable devices.",

abstract="In this technological era, every person, authorities, entrepreneurs, businesses, and many things around us are connected to the internet, forming Internet of thing (IoT). This generates a massive amount of diverse data with very high-speed, termed as big data. However, this data is very useful that can be used as an asset for the businesses, organizations, and authorities to predict future in various aspects. However, efficiently processing Big Data while making real-time decisions is a quite challenging task. Some of the tools like Hadoop are used for Big Datasets processing. On the other hand, these tools could not perform well in the case of real-time high-speed stream processing. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Big Data stream processing approach while mapping Hadoop MapReduce equivalent mechanism on graphics processing units (GPUs). We integrated a parallel and distributed environment of Hadoop ecosystem and a real-time streaming processing tool, i.e., Spark with GPU to make the system more powerful in order to handle the overwhelming amount of high-speed streaming. We designed a MapReduce equivalent algorithm for GPUs for a statistical parameter calculation by dividing overall Big Data files into fixed-size blocks. Finally, the system is evaluated while considering the efficiency aspect (processing time and throughput) using (1) large-size city traffic video data captured by static as well as moving vehicles' cameras while identifying vehicles and (2) large text-based files, like twitter data files, structural data, etc. Results show that the proposed system working with Spark on top and GPUs under the parallel and distributed environment of Hadoop ecosystem is more efficient and real-time as compared to existing standalone CPU-based MapReduce implementation.",

abstract="Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a wireless technology used in various applications to minimize the complexity of everyday life. However, it opens a large number of security and privacy issues that require to be addressed before its successful deployment. Many RFID authentication protocols are proposed in recent years to address security and privacy issues, and most of them are based on lightweight cryptographic techniques such as pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), or bitwise logical operations. However, the existing RFID authentication protocols suffer from security weaknesses, and cannot solve most of the security and privacy problems. A new solution is necessary to address security and privacy issues. In this paper, an improved three-pass mutual authentication protocol (ITPMAP) for low-cost RFID tags is proposed to offer an adequate security level for RFID systems. The proposed ITPMAP protocol uses one PRNG on the tag side and heavy-weighted cryptographic techniques (i.e., digital signature and password-based encryption schemes) on the back-end server side instead of lightweight cryptographic techniques to address the security and privacy issues. The ITPMAP protocol is secure against various attacks such as cloning, spoofing, replay, and desynchronization attacks. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, the ITPMAP protocol is adopted to propose the design of three real-life RFID systems; namely: Signing and Verification of Graduation Certificate System, issuing and verification of e-ticketing system, and charging and discharging of prepaid card system. The Unified Modeling Language is used to demonstrate the design of the proposed ITPMAP protocol and systems. Java language is used for the implementation of the proposed systems. In addition, the ``Mifare Classic'' tags and readers are used as RFID apparatuses for the proposed systems.",

Numerous achievements have emerged successively recently. Among these mechanisms designing routing protocols is one of the most promising ones owing to the large amount of energy consumed for data transmission. The background and related works are described firstly in detail in this paper. Then a game model for selecting the Cluster Head is presented. Subsequently, a novel routing protocol named Game theory based Energy Efficient Clustering routing protocol (GEEC) is proposed. GEEC, which belongs to a kind of clustering routing protocols, adopts evolutionary game theory mechanism to achieve energy exhaust equilibrium as well as lifetime extension at the same time. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted. The experimental results indicate that a significant improvement in energy balance as well as in energy conservation compared with other two kinds of well-known clustering routing protocols is achieved.",

Under these conditions a highly dynamic link-state and link quality are observed. In this paper we present a study of the link layer behavior of wireless BSNs operating at 2.45 GHz. We report on a wearable body-centric network operation in realistic environments from which we characterize the wireless channels based on a novel test framework. Our test framework uses a 200 ms time resolution for sampling of the wireless links between on-body sensor nodes. We record the received signal strength indicator and link quality indicator values as well as the packet delivery statistics in real-time. Based on recorded experiments we quantify the potential packet delivery performance and energy gain that can be obtained by using dynamic routing and adaptive transmission power schemes, respectively. Subsequently we formulate a set of requirements for the next revision of our prototype wireless BSN developed at Aarhus University School of Engineering in Denmark.",

This method allows for reducing image sizes without reducing the information content of the images in terms of detecting tumors. The proposed method involves first clarifying the brain tumor area using a modified K-means clustering method and initial segmentation using mean shift segmentation. Then a threshold setting is used to convert the gray scale image and remove noise by applying an erode operation. Finally, the brain tumors in the images are detected using a watershed algorithm. The proposed method was compared with two well-known methods namely the conventional K-mean clustering and Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering. We verified the precision and the objectivity of our proposed method. The average precision and recall for our proposed method were excellent with values of 0.914052 and 0.995641, respectively. Our method detected more brain tumors than the conventional K-means clustering and FCM clustering methods and was able to provide for an efficient image data processing with reduced file sizes.",

abstract="Profiling technologies are the facilitating force behind the vision of Ambient Intelligence in which everyday devices are connected and embedded with all kinds of smart characteristics enabling them to take decisions in order to serve our preferences without us being aware of it. These technological practices have considerable impact on the process by which our personhood takes shape and pose threats like discrimination and normalisation. The legal response to these developments should move away from a focus on entitlements to personal data, towards making transparent and controlling the profiling process by which knowledge is produced from these data. The tendency in intellectual property law to commodify information embedded in software and profiles could counteract this shift to transparency and control. These rights obstruct the access and contestation of the design of the code that impacts one's personhood. This triggers a political discussion about the public nature of this code and forces us to rethink the relations between property, privacy and personhood in the digital age.",

abstract="Interaction in smart environments should be adapted to the users' preferences, e.g., utilising modalities appropriate for the situation. While manual customisation of a single application could be feasible, this approach would require too much user effort in the future, when a user interacts with numerous applications with different interfaces, such as e.g. a smart car, a smart fridge, a smart shopping assistant etc. Supporting user groups, jointly interacting with the same application, poses additional challenges: humans tend to respect the preferences of their friends and family members, and thus the preferred interface settings may depend on all group members. This work proposes to decrease the manual customisation effort by addressing the cold-start adaptation problem, i.e., predicting interface preferences of individuals and groups for new (unseen) combinations of applications, tasks and devices, based on knowledge regarding preferences of other users. For predictions we suggest several reasoning strategies and employ a classifier selection approach for automatically choosing the most appropriate strategy for each interface feature in each new situation. The proposed approach is suitable for cases where long interaction histories are not yet available, and it is not restricted to similar interfaces and application domains, as we demonstrate by experiments on predicting preferences of individuals and groups for three different application prototypes: recipe recommender, cooking assistant and car servicing assistant. The results show that the proposed method handles the cold-start problem in various types of unseen situations fairly well: it achieved an average prediction accuracy of                                                                           {\$}{\$}72 {\backslash}pm 1{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                                                                                    72                        {\textpm}                        1                                                {\%}                                                                            . Further studies on user acceptance of predictions with two different user communities have shown that this is a desirable feature for applications in smart environments, even when predictions are not so accurate and when users do not perceive manual customisation as very time-consuming.",

abstract="The emergence of cloud computing has made it become an attractive solution for large-scale data processing and storage applications. Cloud infrastructures provide users a remote access to powerful computing capacity, large storage space and high network bandwidth to deploy various applications. With the support of cloud computing, many large-scale applications have been migrated to cloud infrastructures instead of running on in-house local servers. Among these applications, continuous write applications (CWAs) such as online surveillance systems, can significantly benefit due to the flexibility and advantages of cloud computing. However, with specific characteristics such as continuous data writing and processing, and high level demand of data availability, cloud service providers prefer to use sophisticated models for provisioning resources to meet CWAs' demands while minimizing the operational cost of the infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel architecture of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs) or commonly referred to as Cloud-of-Clouds. Based on this architecture, we propose two operational cost-aware algorithms for provisioning cloud resources for CWAs, namely neighboring optimal resource provisioning algorithm and global optimal resource provisioning algorithm, in order to minimize the operational cost and thereby maximizing the revenue of CSPs. We validate the proposed algorithms through comprehensive simulations. The two proposed algorithms are compared against each other to assess their effectiveness, and with a commonly used and practically viable round-robin approach. The results demonstrate that NORPA and GORPA outperform the conventional round-robin algorithm by reducing the operational cost by up to 28 and 57 {\%}, respectively. The low complexity of the proposed cost-aware algorithms allows us to apply it to a realistic Cloud-of-Clouds environment in industry as well as academia.",

abstract="In this paper, we have proposed and designed DPHK (data prediction based on HMM according to activity pattern knowledge mined from trajectories), a real-time distributed predicted data collection system to solve the congestion and data loss caused by too many connections to sink node in indoor smart environment scenarios (like Smart Home, Smart Wireless Healthcare and so on). DPHK predicts and sends predicted data at one time instead of sending the triggered data of these sensor nodes which people is going to pass in several times. Firstly, our system learns the knowledge of transition probability among sensor nodes from the historical binary motion data through data mining. Secondly, it stores the corresponding knowledge in each sensor node based on a special storage mechanism. Thirdly, each sensor node applies HMM (hidden Markov model) algorithm to predict the sensor node locations people will arrive at according to the receivedmessage. At last, these sensor nodes send their triggered data and the predicted data to the sink node. The significances of DPHK are as follows: (a) the procedure of DPHK is distributed; (b) it effectively reduces the connection between sensor nodes and sink node. The time complexities of the proposed algorithms are analyzed and the performance is evaluated by some designed experiments in a smart environment.",

abstract="With the advent of high efficacy light emitting diode directional lamps as a key component in focal lighting, new possibilities emerge for re-designing the smart home scenario. A smart home scenario is characterized by enabled intelligent interworking of various wireless and wired technologies to provide inhabitants with ease of use of appliances, while creating a personalized and safe ambience space. More and more high and low data rate circulates within the indoor ambient space (e.g., home, hospitals, offices). Although, unlicensed technologies, such as wireless local area networks can take upon part of the indoor traffic, the ever increasing demand for such data, and users, calls for either use of licensed or novel unlicensed wireless communication technologies as part of the smart home enablers. This paper focuses on the potentials of visible light communications (VLCs), jointly with radio and fiber communications, to support very dense low and high data rate connectivity, while enabling deployment of secure-sensitive indoor applications, including indoor tracking and localization. The paper proposes a scenario for integrating VLC into the smart home scenario and a conceptual supporting architecture for its deployment. Further, the technical challenges and possible roadmap for the actual deployment are analyzed for the particular case of an eHealth scenario where the utilization of VLC technology is the enabler of the cost-efficient rollout of the required infrastructure and thus the game-changer in a multi-billion eHealth niche that is seeking for cost affordable solutions.",

abstract="This paper proposes an energy-efficient routing mechanism by introducing intentional mobility to wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with obstacles. In the sensing field, Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs) can freely move for collecting data from sensors. An MDC begins its periodical movement from the base station and finally returns and transports the data to the base station. In physical environments, the sensing field may contain various obstacles. A research challenge is how to find an obstacle-avoiding shortest tour for the MDC. Firstly, we obtain the same size grid cells by dividing the network region. Secondly, according to the line sweep technique, the spanning graph is easily constructed. The spanning graph composed of some grid cells usually includes the shortest search path for the MDC. Then, based on the spanning graph, we can construct a complete graph by Warshall-Floyd algorithm. Finally, we present a heuristic tour-planning algorithm on the basis of the complete graph. Through simulation, the validity of our method is verified. This paper contributes in providing an energy-efficient routing mechanism for the WSNs with obstacles.",

abstract="Trust Management has been proved to be an effective method to detect malicious nodes and ensure security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). While, most existing trust management methods are not good at dealing with uncertainty of trust relationship such as randomness, fuzziness in WSNs, which leads to inaccurate trust metric. In this paper, a trust evaluation method for clustered wireless sensor networks based on cloud model is proposed and evaluated, which implements the conversion between qualitative and quantitative of sensor nodes' trust metrics in order to achieve better trust evaluation. Firstly, the method considers multi-factors including communication factor, message factor and energy factor and builds mathematical model for each trust factor to get factor trust cloud. Secondly, immediate trust cloud is calculated by assigning adjustive weights for each factor trust cloud and combining them. Thirdly, recommendation trust cloud and immediate trust cloud are synthesized according to time sensitive factor in order to get final trust cloud. Furthermore, the final trust cloud of sensor node is converted to trust grade by trust cloud decision-making. Verification Experiments manifest that the proposed method has feasibility and accuracy in the aspect of evaluating sensor nodes' trust. Moreover, comparison experiments under different attacks show that our method is sensitive to multiple attacks, it outperforms other trust evaluation methods not only in the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes, but also in the tolerance of abnormal conditions.",

abstract="The integration of sensing and mobile computing devices has led to the evolution of crowd sensing networks (CSNs). The widespread usage of built-in sensors in mobile devices that are carried by people on a daily basis provides new opportunities for gathering information that can be used in numerous large-scale applications. In most applications for CSNs, opportunistic users want to avoid consuming their own resources if there is no sufficient incentive. Therefore, we need to develop an energy-efficient multi-hop data forwarding method to deliver the sensory data generated by opportunistic users to participatory users. In this study, we present a multi-hop data forwarding method for use in CSNs to facilitate environmental monitoring applications. We use IEEE 802.15.4 to save the battery energy of opportunistic users. The proposed method is based on dynamic source routing (DSR). However, utilizing DSR over IEEE 802.15.4 leads to packet fragmentation, which degrades the network performance, because the header grows as a function of the route length in DSR and due to the limited packet size of IEEE 802.15.4. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop data forwarding method to reduce the header overheads. The novel feature of this method is the abbreviation of an intermediate node's address. In our evaluation, we estimated the fragmentation ratio and our results showed that the fragmentation ratio of the proposed method remained relatively stable compared with other methods, even as the volume of data increased. The network performance is efficient and effective in terms of the latency and delivery ratio.",

At the same time, the relationships between e-engagement and continuance intention and between perceived enjoyment and continuance intention are hypothetically moderated by e-interaction quality. The hypotheses of this work were empirically tested using data from working professionals in a technology industry regarding their use of MTSS for travel information sharing as well as booking for accommodation, airline, cars, etc. This study conducted a two-wave survey to empirically test its theoretical rationales. The findings of this work complement the previous literature by verifying the full mediating mechanism of e-engagement and perceived enjoyment and the moderating mechanism of e-interaction quality.

abstract="This article examines a medical biotechnology known as a wireless body area network (WBAN) as a way to discuss how electronic information infrastructure is spatially extending human bodies into physical landscapes. The term extensible body is introduced, framed by the object-oriented philosophy of Graham Harman. WBANs are sensors placed on or inside of the human body to measure, record, and transmit data about the biological processes of a medical patient. I argue that these body-data should be considered components of bodies themselves, not representations of them. Further, I argue that the geographical discourse on relationality should be less about object relations and more about object extensions. Harman's explication of the ``quadruple object,'' and specifically his use of real and sensual objects makes this possible. This questions the spatial beginnings and ends of categorical objects such as bodies and information, the implications of which could have profound impacts on how policies are framed in sectors such as public health, environment, planning, and medicine. The notion of extensibility is crucial in theorizing how, and where, the Geoweb exists as a spatial-technical assemblage of objects and information. The case of WBANs shows that a theorization of the Geoweb must include the built infrastructure of data storage as a spatial extension of being human.",

abstract="Plant disease detection attracts significant attention in the field of agriculture where image based disease detection plays an important role. To improve the yield of plants, it is necessary to detect the onset of diseases in plants and advice the farmers to act based on the suggestions. In this paper, a novel web enabled disease detection system (WEDDS) based on compressed sensing (CS) is proposed to detect and classify the diseases in leaves. Statistical based thresholding strategy is proposed for segmentation of the diseased leaf. CS measurements of the segmented leaf are uploaded to the cloud to reduce the storage complexity. At the monitoring site, the measurements are retrieved and the features are extracted from the reconstructed segmented image. The analysis and classification is done using support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed WEDDS has been evaluated in terms of accuracy and is compared with the existing techniques. The WEDDS was also evaluated experimentally using Raspberry pi 3 board. The results show that the proposed method provides an overall detection accuracy of 98.5{\%} and classification accuracy of 98.4{\%}.",

It takes the path loss exponent and the energy control coefficient into consideration with the aim to accentuate the minimum covering district of each node more accurately and precisely according to various network application scenarios. Besides, a self-healing scheme that enhances the robustness of the network was provided. It makes the topology tolerate more dead nodes than existing algorithms. Simulation was done under OMNeT++ platform and the results show that the LA-TPA strategy is more effective in constructing a well-performance network topology based on various application scenarios and can prolong the network lifetime significantly.",

abstract="Depression is an important mental disease of global concern. Its complicated etiology and chronic clinical features make it difficult for users to be conscious of their own depression emotion and seriously threaten the patient's life safety. With the development of e-commerce, intelligent recommender system has brought new opportunities to personalized health monitoring for the users with emotional distress. Therefore, this paper puts forward the emHealth system, which is an intelligent health recommendation system with depression prediction for emotion health. This paper explores the monitoring and improvement of users psychological and physiological conditions by pushing personalized therapy solutions to patients with emotional distress. Specifically, this paper first proposes the system architecture of emHealth. Then, we design personalized mobile phone Apps to collect emotional data of users with tendentious depressive mood, and find the five main external characteristics of depression by Pearson correlation analysis. We divide 1047 volunteers data into training set and test set, and construct prediction model of depression using decision tree and support vector machine algorithms. For the different external factors that lead to depression, we give personalized recommendation and intelligent decision-making solution, and push related emotional improvement suggestions to guide users behavior. Finally, a specific application scene is demonstrated where patient's family member carry out psychological counseling for the patient, to verify the practicability and validity of the system. The beneficial effects of this system can meet the needs of the electronic market and can be promoted and popularized.",

day="24",
abstract="Today's medical industry can be represented by a human-centered u-healthcare paradigm that is available and accessible anywhere, where high-tech IT can serve as the basis at any time and any place. In addition, in the medical industry, studies of many of the developments and applications are actively conducted based on the development of information communication technology. The aim of medical-information systems is the construction of an advanced IT and integrated u-healthcare system that evolves in the direction of integrated medical-based IT-convergence systems. Accordingly, to resolve the problems of telemedicine, in terms of the remote access to medical data, some public and private initiatives have been proposed, ranging from patient-mobility approaches to medical data. In addition, regarding GENICloud, which provides links with the existing future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud, two out of the seven GENIAM APIs have been announced as the common APIs of the future Internet testbeds in GENI, and they have been implemented and are provided. In the present GENI Cloud system, due to the provision of limited APIs, restrictions may occur in the future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud system management. Therefore, this study proposes a cloud-based mobile health service for the enhancement of the quality of service (QoS) including factors such as reliability and response time to resolve the problems of the broadband-communication infrastructure in the existing mobile health service and the delay problem on the wireless body area network. In this paper, we propose the cloud-based u-healthcare network with a QoS-guaranteed mobile health service. For this method, the TMO-distribution object model that was used in the existing research to implement a reliable and efficient cloud system for users was not used, and instead, a cloud-platform environment was built up through the construction of a distributed system based on a cluster-based mobile object. For this purpose, this study considered the characteristics of the wireless-communication environments between the terminals and the cloud servers in the mobile cloud environment and the proposed cloud mobility services and the specialized mobile cloud-control software. Later, for linkages with cloud computing environments and testbeds was proposed. In addition, this study carried out a cloud mobility-control design to provide a service in the mobile cloud environment that is based on the actual future Internet testbeds. Lastly, based on the structured cloud-platform environment, this study designed access interfaces to provide a mobile healthcare service in consideration of the user convenience. For the mobile-service access interfaces, since the same service interfaces can be used to access the characteristics and functions of all of the applications from browsers and device clients, the model-view-controller structure of the platform was designed, including the components for the further improvement of the requirements, reuse, and maintenance of the codes in medium and large distributed systems.",

title="Outdoor Path Loss Predictions Based on Extreme Learning Machine",
journal="Wireless Personal Communications",
year="2017",
month="Dec",
day="14",
abstract="In a typical outdoor environment, the propagation of radio waves is usually random in nature, to the extent that the characterization of the wireless channel often becomes very difficult. Several models have been developed to predict the average Received Signal Strength (RSS) for specified distance ranges. However, the use of deterministic models requires high computational efficiency while the prediction results of empirical models may not be as accurate as required. On machine learning approach, the performances of multi-layered feed-forward network models are limited by slow convergence and local minimum, such that a global optimal solution is not guaranteed. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm is considered in the development of an optimal path loss prediction model for outdoor propagation scenario. Single Hidden Layer Feed-forward Neural Networks (SHLFNNs) are trained and tested with the path loss data that were computed based on the RSS data of a commercial 1800 MHz base station located along Lagos-Badagry highway in Nigeria. The training speed, learning effectiveness, and the generalization ability of Artificial Neural Network Back-Propagation (ANN-BP) and ELM algorithms are analysed. Experimental results show that ELM models are 140 times faster to train than the ANN-BP models. On prediction accuracy, the outputs of ELM, ANN-BP, Okumura--Hata, and COST-231 models have Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of 2.896, 2.449, 7.456, and 6.116 dB respectively; and regression coefficient (R) values of 0.959, 0.973, 0.935, and 0.935 respectively, when compared to the target variable of the training dataset. When the models were tested with new input data that were excluded from the training process, RMSE values of 4.250, 6.622, 8.732, and 7.087 respectively; and R values of 0.893, 0.876, 0.904, and 0.904 respectively are obtained. In conclusion, the findings of this study confirm that ELM algorithm guarantees an optimal path loss model with fast training convergence, high prediction accuracy, and good generalization ability for radio network planning and optimization in outdoor environments.",

Many researchers focused on developing energy efficient clustering algorithms for WSN, but less research has been concerned in the mobile User Equipment (UE) acting as a Cluster Head (CH) for data transmission between cellular networks and WSNs. In this paper, we propose a cellular-assisted UE CH selection algorithm for the WSN, which considers several parameters to choose the optimal UE gateway CH. We analyze the energy cost of data transmission from a sensor node to the next node or gateway and calculate the whole system energy cost for a WSN. Simulation results show that better system performance, in terms of system energy cost and WSNs life time, can be achieved by using interactive optimization with cellular networks.",

abstract="The usage of computer vision adds a new paradigm in the field of animal biometric, and has recently received more attention due to the growing importance of identification and tracking of animal species or individual animals. Biometric characteristics help to develop a better representation and a better identification of different animal species and individual animals. In this work, we propose an effective approach for automatic cattle recognition based on the multiple features of muzzle points and the cattle face images. The proposed method deals the cattle recognition problem as a classification problem among the multiple linear regression models and provides a new theory for the recognition of individual cattle. The group sparse signal representation based classification offers the key to addressing this problem using L2-minimization. In this paper, a comparative study among the well-established handcrafted texture feature extraction techniques and the appearance-based feature extraction techniques is also presented. A detailed set of experimental results on muzzle point image database is also carried to prove the theory. Our method has achieved 93.87{\%} identification accuracy which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method than the other existing machine learning based recognition algorithms.",

First, it can expedite digital health intervention development, improving efficacy, and increasing reach. Second, moving behavioral health interventions to digital platforms presents researchers with novel (potentially paradigm shifting) opportunities for advancing theories and techniques. In particular, the potential for technology to revolutionize theory refinement is made possible by leveraging the proliferation of ``real-time'' objective measurement and ``big data'' commonly generated and stored by digital platforms. Much more could be done to realize this potential. This paper offers proposals for better leveraging the potential advantages of digital health platforms, and reviews three of the cutting edge methods for doing so: optimization designs, dynamic systems modeling, and social network analysis.",

abstract="With the increasing demand for automated, remote, intelligent, and real-time healthcare services in smart cities, smart healthcare monitoring is necessary to provide improved and complete care to residents. In this monitoring, health-related media or signals collected from smart-devices/objects are transmitted and processed to cater to the need for quality care. However, it is challenging to create a framework or method to handle media-related healthcare data analytics or signals (e.g., voice/audio, video, or electroglottographic (EGG) signals) to meet the complex on-demand healthcare needs for successful smart city management. To this end, this paper proposes a cloud-oriented smart healthcare monitoring framework that interacts with surrounding smart devices, environments, and smart city stakeholders for affordable and accessible healthcare. As a smart city healthcare monitoring case study, a voice pathology detection (VPD) method is proposed. In the proposed method, two types of input, a voice signal and an EGG signal, are used. The input devices are connected to the Internet and the captured signals are transmitted to the cloud. The signals are then processed and classified as either normal or pathologic with a confidence score. These results are passed to registered doctors that make the final decision and take appropriate action. To process the signals, local features are extracted from the first-order derivative of the voice signal, and shape and cepstral features are extracted from the EGG signal. For classification, a Gaussian mixture model-based approach is used. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve VPD that is more than 93{\%} accurate.",

Also, for SmPHR, we evaluated the transmission error rate between the interface using four PHDs and personal health record systems (PHRs) from previous research, with 611 users and elderly people after receiving institutional review board (IRB) approval. In the evaluation, the PAN interface showed 15 (2.4 {\%}) errors, and the WAN and HRN interface showed 13 (2.1 {\%}) errors in a total of 611 transmission attempts. Also, we received opinions regarding SmPHR from 15 healthcare professionals who took part in the clinical trial. Thus, SmPHR can be provided as an interconnected PHR mobile health service to patients, allowing `plug and play' of PHDs and EMRs through various standard protocols.",

We design the system in such a way that it provides good recognition accuracy, provides low-cost modeling, and is scalable. The system takes two main types of input, video and audio, which are captured in a multi-sensory environment. Speech and video input are processed separately during feature extraction and modeling; these two input modalities are merged at score level, where the scores are obtained from the models of different patients' states. For the experiments, 100 people were recruited to mimic a patient's states of normal, pain, and tensed. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an average 98.2 {\%} recognition accuracy.",

In the system, we use a local binary pattern (LBP) and a co-occurrence matrix from the region of interest (where there is a possible mass) of the mammogram image. Several features are extracted from the LBP and the matrix to describe the mass. A support vector machine is used as a classifier.

abstract="Towards the provision of medical research and eHealth services, several Health Information Technology (HIT) platforms are blended with communication and software technologies (i.e. mobile and Web applications, wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things and cloud computing). However, an important research issue is whether and to what degree these technologies are efficiently and effectively integrated into medical practice. Accordingly, this study reviews recent literature on HITs that employ RCTs, which are acknowledged as a reliable solution by the community of health stakeholders. Furthermore, it examines the research efforts in the field and evaluates the relevant functionalities. The literature search strategy was based on PRISMA 2009 Checklist and the CONSORT-EHEALTH Checklist that are two standard methodologies for systematic reviews in Evidence Based Medicine and Health Information Technologies. The analysis of the studies included was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The sources considered in this research include the most common clinical trial registries and academic electronic databases. The studies considered were conducted from 2008 until 2016. The authors considered RCTs having published their results in at least one article. As a result, 55 articles from 42 different journals are considered in this review. The benefits of the HIT delivered interventions are clearly presented in the outcomes of the relevant studies. Significant improvements were observed in the findings of 31 trials from a total of 51 (60.78{\%}) including the acceptance, satisfaction, reliability, usefulness, safety, effectiveness and financial benefit of HITs. The results of this review reveal that HIT and eHealth interventions achieve at least equally reliable and safe outcomes compared with the usual support methods of healthcare. Significantly encouraging results are noticed in interventions employing HIT over several healthcare fields.",

abstract="In the last decade `big data' has become a buzzword used in several industrial sectors, including but not limited to telephony, finance and healthcare. Despite its popularity, it is not always clear what big data refers to exactly. Big data has become a very popular topic in healthcare, where the term primarily refers to the vast and growing volumes of computerized medical information available in the form of electronic health records, administrative or health claims data, disease and drug monitoring registries and so on. This kind of data is generally collected routinely during administrative processes and clinical practice by different healthcare professionals: from doctors recording their patients' medical history, drug prescriptions or medical claims to pharmacists registering dispensed prescriptions. For a long time, this data accumulated without its value being fully recognized and leveraged. Today big data has an important place in healthcare, including in pharmacovigilance. The expanding role of big data in pharmacovigilance includes signal detection, substantiation and validation of drug or vaccine safety signals, and increasingly new sources of information such as social media are also being considered. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the uses of big data for drug safety post-marketing assessment.",

abstract="Among the extensive and impressive collection of applications enabled by IoT, smart and interactive healthcare is a particularly important one. To gather rich information indicator of our mental and physical health, IoT based sensors are either worn on the body or embedded in the living environment. Moreover, by incorporating the mobile computing technology in IoT based healthcare systems, the reactive care system can be transformed to proactive and preventive healthcare systems. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT based smart student m-healthcare monitoring framework is proposed. This framework computes the student diseases severity by predicting the potential disease with its level by temporally mining the health measurements collected from medical and other IoT devices. To effectively analyze the student healthcare data, an architectural model for smart student health care system has been designed. In our case study, health dataset of 182 suspected students are simulated to generate relevant waterborne diseses cases. This data is further analyzed to validate our model by using k-cross validation approach. Pattern based diagnosis scheme is applied using various classification algorithms and then results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and response time. Experimental results show that Decision tree (C4.5) and k-neighest neighbour algorithms perform better as compared to other classifiers in terms of above mentioned parameters. Moreover, the proposed methodology is effective in decision making by delivering time sensitive information to caretaker or doctor within specific time. Lastly, the temporal granule pattern based presentation reterives effective diagnosis results for the proposed system.",

abstract="The successful use of intelligent agents in healthcare has attracted researchers to apply this emerging software engineering paradigm in more advanced and complex applications. Main success factor is the natural mapping of real world medical problems into cyber world. Multi-agent architecture can easily model the heterogeneous, distributed and autonomous health care systems. The multi agent systems have been applied from single healthcare activity like knowledge based medical system to complex, multi-component based systems like complete healthcare unit. The use of multi agent systems in health care domain has also opened the ways to find out new applications like personalized and socialized health care systems. This versatile use of multi agent systems has also posed new problems for researchers like; security, communication, and different social issues. This work reviews recent years' research and applications of multi agent systems in healthcare published in different research journals, international conferences, and implemented practically. We reviewed five subdomains and three systems in each subdomain. A set of common parameters of these systems has been extracted and compared to analyze systems' merits and deficiencies. Based on our analysis, we have provided recommendations for multi agent systems applied in healthcare domain. Future research directions for interested researchers and practitioners are also discussed. As our own future research work, we intend to study healthcare and multi agent systems in e-commerce.",

abstract="The remote health monitoring system (RHMS) has become more real-time because the internet plus technology develops quickly. To support real-time health monitoring server, three main aspects, such as collecting, transferring and analyzing the health data, should be integrated into a system. So far, many challenges have been solved and many RHMSs have been applied in our daily lives. It is significant to use RHMS to take good care of clients who live alone, especially monitors the health data of clients in nursing home. This paper introduces a health gateway which automatically collects information of the clients. The information includes the users' identity, vital signs, body temperature, clients' real-time location and falling action detection. Moreover, the health gateway transmits information in WIFI relaying mode until the information is received by the background server. If the information is abnormal, the health gateway would send an alarm to the server. The server should call a doctor or caretaker and send accurate navigation based on real-time location in 3D architectural modeling to their mobile devices for finding clients quickly.",

abstract="Due to the technological advancement in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), sensor node mobility becomes a basic requirement for many extensive applications. Routing protocol designed for LLNs must ensure real-time data transmission with minimum power consumption. However, the existing mobility support protocols cannot work efficiently in LLNs as they are unable to adapt to the change in the network topology quickly. Therefore, we propose an Enhanced Routing Protocol for LLNs (ERPL), which updates the Preferred Parent (PP) of the Mobile Node (MN) quickly whenever the MN moves away from the already selected PP. Further, a new objective function that takes the mobility of the node into an account while selecting a PP is proposed. Performance of the ERPL has been evaluated with the varying system and traffic parameters under different topologies similar to most of the real-life networks. The simulation results showed that the proposed ERPL reduced the power consumption, packet overhead, latency and increased the packet delivery ratio as compared to other existing works.",

abstract="Hand-biometric-based personal identification is considered to be an effective method for automatic recognition. However, existing systems require strict constraints during data acquisition, such as costly devices, specified postures, simple background, and stable illumination. In this paper, a contactless personal identification system is proposed based on matching hand geometry features and color features. An inexpensive Kinect sensor is used to acquire depth and color images of the hand. During image acquisition, no pegs or surfaces are used to constrain hand position or posture. We segment the hand from the background through depth images through a process which is insensitive to illumination and background. Then finger orientations and landmark points, like finger tips or finger valleys, are obtained by geodesic hand contour analysis. Geometric features are extracted from depth images and palmprint features from intensity images. In previous systems, hand features like finger length and width are normalized, which results in the loss of the original geometric features. In our system, we transform 2D image points into real world coordinates, so that the geometric features remain invariant to distance and perspective effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed hand-biometric-based personal identification system is effective and robust in various practical situations.",

abstract="This paper undertakes a comparative legal study to analyze the challenges of privacy and personal data protection posed by Artificial Intelligence (``AI'') embedded in Robots, and to offer policy suggestions. After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (``PbD'') originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the ``context'' should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the ``algorithmic black box'' or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination. If AI surpasses human intelligence, a terminating function, such as a ``kill switch'' will be the last resort to preserve individual choice. Despite numerous difficulties, we must prepare for the coming AI-prevalent society by taking a flexible approach.",

The presented scheme combines security against data modification and denial of service attacks with traffic and storage efficiency. This is achieved by involving all sensor nodes in the network in the authentication process, implementing cooperative authentication with multiple authenticators, and using dual storage. Detailed analysis and extensive simulation tests show that our scheme achieves better performance compared to related schemes published in the literature in terms of traffic, storage, security against DoS attacks, and security against data replacement attacks.",

The trajectories are classified as normal or anomalous based on the number of paths in the clusters. On synthetic datasets with fixed and variable numbers of clusters and anomalies, we achieve 98 {\%} classification accuracy. Our two-stage clusiVAT method is applied to 26,039 trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians from a parking lot scene from the real life MIT trajectories dataset. The first stage clusters the trajectories ignoring directionality. The second stage divides the clusters obtained from the first stage by considering trajectory direction. We show that our novel two-stage clusiVAT approach can produce natural and informative trajectory clusters on this real life dataset while finding representative anomalies.",

Cognitive radio is able to exploit spectrum opportunities and increase the communication performance for the e-healthcare system. To access the spectrum safely, the security aspect of spectrum utilization should be carefully addressed. A well-known threat to the spectrum utilization is the primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in which the attackers emulate as the primary users to obtain spectrum opportunities. To defend this threat, in this paper, we propose a triple threshold energy detection (TTED) to identify the PUEA. Based on the TTED, legitimate devices are allowed to access the available channels when the licensed channel is idle or occupied by attackers.

abstract="As more and more content migrates to the Internet, ``personal'' video choices are becoming the norm not the exception. The impact of Internet content and IP-based video distribution is still difficult to evaluate. However, there is obviously no turning back as this content pervades the home and the community. Driven in large part by the near-ubiquitous IP-based communication services, the TV experience has been extended over the years to embrace many of the same ancillary services provided by web applications. This new TV promises to deliver a world of content and services to ``any device, anywhere, anytime.'' This article addresses the architecture, the value chain and the technical and business challenges of implementing this new connected mobile and social TV experience. To put the architecture into a context, this article also presents a use case of the distributed community Digital Video Recorder (DVR) as an implementation of this vision.",

abstract="With the rapid development of sensing technology, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are connecting our real-world and cyber spaces by real-time situation awareness and intelligent control. In this process, one of the major challenge is how to make fast, accurate and intelligent decisions based on high-dimension, speed and volume sensing data stream. In this paper, we put human into the traditional CPS data process model and formulate a closed-loop computing paradigm for CPS data and decision intelligence. We propose a human-in-the-loop reference model for CPS, which extends the traditional cyber-physical interaction into a closed-loop process based on cyber, physical and human factors. We define the key features of human-in-the-loop CPS, summarize it as three aspects: semantic, interactive, iterative and analyze the major challenges from the perspective of data characteristics. Recent progresses in three typical application domains are reviewed and examined for their decision models and whether they have solved the target issues of human-in-the-loop CPS. According to the review and comparison, the paper finally summarizes several key future opportunities to establish an intelligent human-in-the-loop CPS.",

Our first hypothesis is that social networks can facilitate epidemiological studies, reducing time and cost. The second question is whether social networks can enable the collection of data from young and healthy subjects who are otherwise beyond the reach of conventional social health polls. A Facebook application was created to collect data concerning adherence to the Mediterranean diet, considering the significant risk of cardiovascular and neurological degenerative diseases in subjects with poor adherence to a healthy diet. More than 1400 users were recruited in a short time without any promotional action. Collected data indicate that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is in general greater in older users vs young (,

A comprehensive search was executed across five electronic databases (January 2005--March 2016). Of the 1911 identified studies, nine met the inclusion criteria of quantitative or mixed methods design, technology-enabled adherence and or retention intervention for US HIV-infected youth. The majority were small pilots. Intervention dose varied between studies applying similar technology platforms with more than half not informed by a theoretical framework. Retention in care was not a reported outcome, and operationalization of adherence was heterogeneous across studies. Despite these limitations, synthesized findings from this review demonstrate feasibility of computer-based interventions, and initial efficacy of SMS texting for adherence support among HIV-infected youth.

According to this principle, various sensor applications for health care scenarios can be realized. In this article several developments of NFC-sensor applications are introduced like NFC-based fill level measurement, NFC-based analog scale (position detection), NFC-based blood-glucose meter, NFC-based cryo-sensor for vials and NFC-based ultraviolet (UV) assessment for sun burn prevention. The main advantages of these applications are that all NFC-sensors can simply be used by medical, nursing staff or patients and consumers.",

abstract="Electrocardiogram (ECG) as one of the best methods to measure irregular heartbeats is a dispensable method for doctor to diagnose Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients. Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of Door to Balloon (D2B) time, which is defined as the time interval starting when an Acute--Myocardial-Infarction patient arrives at the Emergency Department, and ending when a catheter guide wire crosses the culprit lesion as the acute-myocardial-infarction treatment on the patient in the cardiac catheterization room. Generally, when a patient with acute-chest pain is sent into a hospital (always to Emergency Department), the hospital will collect his/her ECG which needs to be evaluated by a cardiologist to ensure that the patient really has Acute Myocardial Infarction. Then the medical workers deliver the patient to the cardiac catheterization room to operate balloon angioplasty. In previous years, the cardiologist must utilize a PC to connect to the Intranet of the hospital and employ a special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can check the patient's ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since the doctor may stay outdoors and he/she needs some time to find a PC and network. Of course, if the PC has not installed the PACS image browser, the doctor has to download and install it. Consequently, the D2B time should be worsened, thus possibly impacting the patient's life. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a Cloud-based Electrocardiogram System, with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG so as to shorten the D2B time. This system has been online in a medical center in middle Taiwan for more than one year. The shortened D2B time is longer than 10 min, i.e., receiving fine results.",

abstract="We present a portable system for personalized blood cell counting consisting of a microfluidic impedance cytometer and portable analog readout electronics, feeding into an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and being transmitted via Bluetooth to a user-accessible mobile application. We fabricated a microfluidic impedance cytometer with a novel portable analog readout. The novel design of the analog readout, which consists of a lock-in-amplifier followed by a high-pass filter stage for subtraction of drift and DC offset, and a post-subtraction high gain stage, enables detection of particles and cells as small as 1 $\mu$m in diameter, despite using a low-end 8-bit ADC. The lock-in-amplifier and the ADC were set up to receive and transmit data from a Bluetooth module. In order to initiate the system, as well as to transmit all of the data, a user friendly mobile application was developed, and a proof-of-concept trial was run on a blood sample. Applications such as personalized health monitoring require robust device operation and resilience to clogging. It is desirable to avoid using channels comparable in size to the particles being detected thus requiring high levels of sensitivity. Despite using low-end off-the-shelf hardware, our sensing platform was capable of detecting changes in impedance as small as 0.032{\%}, allowing detection of 3 $\mu$m diameter particles in a 300 $\mu$m wide channel. The sensitivity of our system is comparable to that of a high-end bench-top impedance spectrometer when tested using the same sensors. The novel analog design allowed for an instrument with a footprint of less than 80 cm2. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the potential of using microfluidic impedance spectroscopy for low cost health monitoring. We demonstrated the utility of the platform technology towards cell counting, however, our platform is broadly applicable to assaying wide panels of biomarkers including proteins, nucleic acids, and various cell types.",

Cryptographic standards and methods were left outside the scope of this review. Three broad classes of models are being actively investigated and developed: access control for electronic health records, access control for interoperability, and access control for risk analysis. Traditional role-based access control models are extended with spatial, temporal, probabilistic, dynamic, and semantic aspects to capture contextual information and provide granular access control. Maintenance of audit trails and facilities for overriding normal roles to allow full access in emergency cases are common features. Access privilege frameworks utilizing ontology-based knowledge representation for defining the rules have attracted considerable interest, due to the higher level of abstraction that makes it possible to model domain knowledge and validate access requests efficiently.",

The dynamic detection of health information requires the biomedical amplifier with small volume, low power consumption, multi-function, and high robustness to noise. In this paper, a novel biomedical signal acquisition circuit based on over-sampling and shaped signal technology is proposed, which is able to detect multiple biomedical signals. A novel algorithm based on the shaped signal has been investigated to extract multiple biomedical signals synchronously without complex signal processing scheme. Specifically, electrocardiograph, respiratory, and standard lead dropping signals are detected synchronously by the circuit. Experiments show that the circuit achieves dynamic monitoring of multiple biomedical signals, good manufacturability, low requirement to the device performance and high-noise suppression. The circuit is highly suitable for the biomedical signals as well as other weak signals monitoring.",

A number of medical ISMS projects are discussed, based on ISO 27791 standards derived from ISO 27001 standards. Large hospitals in South Korea have a variety of platforms that misrepresent personal information, and various platforms deal with sensitive medical information, but small and medium-sized hospitals use platforms that are not considered legal considerations.In this paper, we intend to establish a legal information sharing platform, which is legally considered legally limited and is responsible for the safety of the medical information.In the IoT server with limited resources, light-weighted and user-friendly protocols are frequently utilized over those that derive traffic and consume much resource.

The physiological signals including electrocardiogram, respiratory inductance plethysmograph, and accelerations (ACC) are sampled, digitalized, stored, and simultaneously transmitted to a mobile phone via Bluetooth. A medical validation test with participants performing discontinuous incremental treadmill (0--12 km/h) exercise was conducted. The results indicate nearly perfect correlations (0.999, 0.996, 0.994), small mean bias (0.60 BPM, 0.51 BPM, 0.05 g), and narrow limits of agreement ({\textpm}2.90 BPM, {\textpm}1.81 BPM, {\textpm}0.09 g) for heart rate (HR), breathing rate (BR), and ACC represented as vector magnitude units (VMUs). There is a general trend of decrease in accuracy, precision, and correlation for HR, BR, and VMU as velocity increases, but these validity statistics are all within acceptable error limits and clinically accepted.

Theoretical analysis indicates that comparing to the random key pre-distribution techniques, IBKAS achieves significant improvement in key connectivity, communication overhead, memory occupation, and security strength, and also enables efficient secure rekeying and network expansion. Furthermore, we implement IBKAS for TinyOS-2.1.2 based on the MICA2 motes, and the experiment results demonstrate that IBKAS is feasible for infrequent key distribution and rekeying for large scale sensor networks.",

abstract="This paper introduces service continuity as the main driver for 5G systems. It addresses user- and service-aspects in recently opened LTE networks, and identifies the system challenges. The main challenges are related to radio coverage, especially for the provision of high data rates for indoor users. The paper covers also network-, user- and service-authentication as well as user and society requirements. 5G is addressed as a system of systems in order to provide service continuity. It addresses both technology challenges, user related issues and operator revenue. Collaborative radio and a system availability beacon are discussed to cope with heterogeneity in 5G. As the SIM card has evolved towards a third-party offering for storage, authentication and payment, functionality of this future SIM is elaborated providing SIM-based service examples. The paper finally addresses service optimization based on light-weight semantic reasoning.",

abstract="The paper focuses on the design of a fast and reliable multi-point vision-based measurement system able to be flexible, low cost and accurate for quality control in industrial robotics applications. The paper discusses a new method for integrating visual quality control in highly dynamic manufacturing lines, where products are added or removed from production. The structure of the vision-based measurement system is described. In particular, the stereo system is created by the movement of a single camera mounted on a six-axis manipulator. The visual software is structured in three phases: single camera and stereo calibration, addition of the visual inspection tasks for the object to be measured, stereo measurement. The feasibility of the proposed solution has been tested in a real industrial application with strong requirements on robot speed. The comparison of experimental results on a target with a simple and well-defined shape has shown that the proposed solution provides better results, in terms of accuracy and measurement speed, when compared to commercial libraries and RGBD vision systems. Besides, the robot motion policy adopted by the solution proposed here guarantees a continuous movement without the need for stop{\&}go phases.",

abstract="To address the incomplete problem in pulmonary parenchyma segmentation based on the traditional methods, a novel automated segmentation method based on an eight-neighbor region growing algorithm with left-right scanning and four-corner rotating and scanning is proposed in this paper. The proposed method consists of four main stages: image binarization, rough segmentation of lung, image denoising and lung contour refining. First, the binarization of images is done and the regions of interest are extracted. After that, the rough segmentation of lung is performed through a general region growing method. Then the improved eight-neighbor region growing is used to remove noise for the upper, middle, and bottom region of lung. Finally, corrosion and expansion operations are utilized to smooth the lung boundary. The proposed method was validated on chest positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) data of 30 cases from a hospital in Shanxi, China. Experimental results show that our method can achieve an average volume overlap ratio of 96.21 {\textpm} 0.39{\%} with the manual segmentation results. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm segments the lung in PET-CT images more efficiently and accurately.",

Though using public key cryptographic schemes like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography would provide sufficient security. Their use has been limited owing to their computationally intensive operations which conflict with the resource limitations in wireless sensor nodes. Key pre-distribution has proved to be the most feasible amongst key management schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

Focusing on the practical problems occurred in the life cycle monitoring of long distance diversion tunnel, the critical issues in this monitoring framework have been researched. The description model for monitoring data and critical processes are analysed and designed. In addition, an end-to-end platform has been developed for the life cycle monitoring of long distance diversion tunnel. The test results validate the feasibility of the monitoring system.

abstract="We are living in an era when the focus of human relationships with the world is shifting from execution and physical impact to control and cognitive/informational interaction. This emerging, increasingly informational world is our new ecology, an infosphere that presents the grounds for a cognitive revolution based on interactions in networks of biological and artificial, intelligent agents. After the industrial revolution, which extended the human body through mechanical machinery, the cognitive revolution extends the human mind/cognition through information-processing machinery. These novel circumstances come with new qualities and preferences demanding new conceptualizations. We have some work ahead of us to establish value systems and practices extended from the real to the increasingly virtual/info-computational. This paper first presents a current view of the virtual versus the real and then offers an interpretation framework based on an info-computational understanding of cognition in which agency implies computational processing of informational structures of the world as an infosphere. The notion of ``good life'' is discussed in light of different ideals of well-being in the infosphere, connecting virtuality as a space of potential and alternative worlds for an agent for whom the reality is a space of actual experiences, in the sense of Deleuze. Even though info-computational framework enables us to see both the real world and the diversity of virtual worlds in terms of computational processes on informational structures, based on a distinct layered cognitive architecture of all physical agents, there is clear difference between potential worlds of the virtual and actual agent's experiences made in the real. Info-computationalism enables insight into the mechanisms of infosphere and elucidates its importance as cognitively predominant environment and communication media. The conclusion is that by cocooning ourselves in an elaborate info-computational infrastructure of the virtual, we may be increasingly isolating ourselves from the reality of direct experience of the world. The biggest challenges of the cognitive revolution may not be technological but ethical. They are about the nature of being human and its values.",

In this paper, we reflect on the interaction between computer scientists and information and IT lawyers on the idea of the `open agent society'. This inspired a programme of research whose investigation into conceptual challenges has carried it from the logical specification of agent societies and dynamic norm-governed systems to self-organising electronic institutions, while developing several technologies for agent-based modelling and complex event recognition. The outcomes of this inter-disciplinary collaboration have also influenced current research into using the open agent society as a platform for socio-technical systems, and other collective adaptive systems. We present a number of research challenges, including the ideas of computational justice and polycentric governance, and explore a number of ethical, legal and social implications. We contend that, in order to address these issues and challenges, the continued inter-disciplinary collaboration between computer science and IT lawyers is critical.",

abstract="It is expected that the LTE network, which includes the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN) in 3GPP LTE systems, will be overloaded due to the huge number of Machine-Type Communication (MTC) devices in the near future. Overload in the RAN and CN of the LTE may result in congestion occurrence, resource waste, Quality of Service (QoS) degradation and in the worst-case, it will cause service unavailability. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive mechanism to manage a large number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN of the LTE network. We use Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme to regulate the MTC traffic according to the congestions level in the RAN and CN. We consider a scenario in which two-priority-based classes of MTC devices are contending for the RAN resources. At first, the overload problem in the RAN is formulated to find the number of allowable contending MTC devices of each class taking into account their required QoS. Then, an active load management policy based on additive increase multiplicative decrease rule is proposed to control the incoming load from multiple cells to the CN. To effectively limit the number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN, in the proposed approach, each Evolved Node B updates the ACB factor upon overload detection in the RAN or CN in an adaptive manner. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is able to manage overload in the CN and RAN simultaneously.",

However, most of current pervasive systems are still being developed based on the so-called the system is the application philosophy, causing the developers to take care of all technical details from the ground up. There is relatively little research focuses on building higher-level abstractions so that the burdens of developers can be relieved. The abstraction of a ``place,'' also known as an ``Ambient,'' is an essential context information when implementing a pervasive system. The quality of the results of a service composition can be improved if the concept of Ambient is taken into account. This paper aims to investigate the use of Ambient in the pervasive system systematically. We propose several new spatial abstractions and a spatial-aware service management scheme for the Ambient on top of a robust service management protocol. Formal verification, complexity analysis, and experiments are performed to verify the robustness, efficiency, and performance of the proposed approach, respectively.",

abstract="With the advent of Internet and exponential growth in its users, that day is not far when the IP addresses used by Internet would exhaust and it would come to a standstill. Not only this to retrieve a data, dependency of server and network overhead can't be overruled but NDN overcomes both these issues of IP addresses and server dependency/network overhead by introducing content centering approach and retrieval from intermediate routers.IPv4 is the protocol, which is most common for Internet connections. It uses a 32-bit addressing scheme resulting in total of 232 addresses. As Internet is growing with fast pace it is expected that soon the unused addresses would be exhausted. A new addressing system IPv6 is used to have more addresses, which allows 2128 addresses. But we can't keep on going on increasing the addresses a newer approach is definitely required which gave birth to NDN in 2009. Keeping this in mind U.S. National Science Foundation's Future Internet Architectures started a project Named Data Networks (NDN). NDN retains the current IP based internet architecture but changes the functionality where signed named content are retrieved by the intended consumers instead of IP packets delivered to the destination.Initial investigation and feasibility studies show that NDN with its principles can remove the gap between internet usage applications and data transport. Furthermore it also aims to simplify the application development process and cater to few of the everlasting issues of today's internet architecture terms of security, scalability, and sustainability. With this aim put forward, the development, implementation and realization of the NDN architecture also faces a number of new challenges like naming and signing of all data chunks and changes in the routing and forwarding strategies. NDN project is still in offspring and there are various research issues which need to be addressed. This paper covers a brief survey of this future internet paradigm and bring out its major outcomes and areas to work in future.",

abstract="This paper proposes a Load-carrying and transmit robot (LCT-Robot), which is based on a novel modular joint, for the purpose of telemaintenance of the Tokamak First wall (FW). The LCT-Robot, which is installed on a Multipurpose transport cask (MTC) and plays the role of transmitting and load-carrying, has the adaptability to several of maintenance tasks by carrying different types of micro-robots. The transmission mechanism of LCT-Robot modular joint and structural ``lightweight'' design is comprehensively considered through establishing the geometric parameter constraint equations related to Tokamak FW. It can steadily provide the ability of long-distance transmitting and performs maintenance tasks when the weight of the micro-robot is changed. Without any gravity compensation, the LCT-robot equipped with ordinary drive motor can bear a wide range of load. It not only satisfies the higher load, but also enhances the efficiency of the drive motor. For avoiding frequent acceleration and deceleration of the LCT-robot, the entire process through small openings from the placement state (0-state) to the flattened state (3-state) is analyzed and the effective translational distance of MTC is confirmed. As a result, experiment verifies the effectiveness of the LCT-robot, which has a length of 2.95 meters and can smoothly pass through small openings (Width: 200 mm, Height: 250 mm).",

abstract="This paper discusses the problem of fault-tolerant control against actuator fault, derives the time spent at each steps in fault diagnosis which is called as the time delay due to fault diagnosis and quantitatively analyzes its effect on the faulty system's performance. A fault diagnosis algorithm is first proposed. The proposed fault tolerant controller is designed to guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, where the controller singularity is avoided without projection algorithm. What's more, the analytical expression of the time delay is derived strictly. Further, the quantitative analysis of system performance which is degraded by the time delay is developed, and the conditions that the magnitudes of the faults should be satisfied such that the faulty system controlled by the normal controller remains bounded even stable during the time delay are derived. In addition, the corresponding solution to the adverse effect of the time delay is proposed. Finally, an experimental test shows that the proposed control algorithm has a very reliable efficiency.",

The existence of such a large amount of apps for a myriad of purposes imposes a huge overhead on users, who are in charge of selecting, installing, and executing the appropriate apps, as well as deleting them when no longer needed. Moreover, these applications have mostly neglected to take into account the user's context, as they propose static non-evolving scenarios of use. The proposed long-life application provides a new way to respond to the user's needs on the fly. It evolves at run time (by including/ excluding business functionalities, updating the interaction mode, and migrating executions) according to the user's needs. While he/she moves in his/her surroundings, the app detects the occurring events and builds contextually-described situations. So, this work aims to offer a new type of mobile application able to detect, formulate and understand the users' context and react accordingly. Therefore, in this paper, we present the overall approach to build a long-life application and we focus on context detection and formulation aspects.",

abstract="As Cloud computing is reforming the infrastructure of IT industries, it has become one of the critical security concerns of the defensive mechanisms applied to secure Cloud environment. Even if there are tremendous advancements in defense systems regarding the confidentiality, authentication and access control, there is still a challenge to provide security against availability of associated resources. Denial-of-service (DoS) attack and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack can primarily compromise availability of the system services and can be easily started by using various tools, leading to financial damage or affecting the reputation. These attacks are very difficult to detect and filter, since packets that cause the attack are very much similar to legitimate traffic. DoS attack is considered as the biggest threat to IT industry, and intensity, size and frequency of the attack are observed to be increasing every year. Therefore, there is a need for stronger and universal method to impede these attacks. In this paper, we present an overview of DoS attack and distributed DoS attack that can be carried out in Cloud environment and possible defensive mechanisms, tools and devices. In addition, we discuss many open issues and challenges in defending Cloud environment against DoS attack. This provides better understanding of the DDoS attack problem in Cloud computing environment, current solution space, and future research scope to deal with such attacks efficiently.",

abstract="Music often plays an important role in people's daily lives. Because it has the power to affect human emotion, music has gained a place in work environments and in sports training as a way to enhance the performance of particular tasks. Studies have shown that office workers perform certain jobs better and joggers run longer distances when listening to music. However, a personalized music system which can automatically recommend songs according to user's physiological response remains absent. Therefore, this study aims to establish an intelligent music selection system for individual users to enhance their learning performance. We first created an emotional music database using data analytics classifications. During testing, innovative wearable sensing devices were used to detect heart rate variability (HRV) in experiments, which subsequently guided music selection. User emotions were then analyzed and appropriate songs were selected by using the proposed application software (App). Machine learning was used to record user preference, ensuring accurate and precise classification. Significant results generated through experimental validation indicate that this system generates high satisfaction levels, does not increase mental workload, and improves users' performance. Under the trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the continuing development of wearable devices, the proposed system could stimulate innovative applications for smart factory, home, and health care.",

We mainly focus on the phase congruency of the spectral CT images in the paper and try to use dimensionality reduction to integrate the information of phase congruency detected in the image. The experimental results show that the algorithm can detect the energy spectrum CT image with clear edge and contour, which is beneficial to the subsequent processing.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call `data for life', wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.",

abstract="Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application's interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

abstract="Mathematical modeling and simulation with medical applications has gained much interest in the last few years, mainly due to the widespread availability of low-cost technology and computational power. This paper presents an integrated platform for the in-silico simulation of trauma incidents, based on a suite of interacting mathematical models. The models cover the generation of a scenario for an incident, a model of physiological evolution of the affected individuals, including the possible effect of the treatment, and a model of evolution in time of the required medical resources. The problem of optimal resource allocation is also investigated. Model parameters have been identified according to the expertise of medical doctors and by reviewing some related literature. The models have been implemented and exposed as web services, while some software clients have been built for the purpose of testing. Due to its extendability, our integrated platform highlights the potential of model-based simulation in different health-related fields, such as emergency medicine and personal health systems. Modifications of the models are already being used in the context of two funded projects, aiming at evaluating the response of health systems to major incidents with and without model-based decision support.",

abstract="In recent years, vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has emerged as a new technology which is being used in wide range of applications in the area of multimedia-based healthcare applications. In VCC, vehicles act as the intelligent machines which can be used to collect and transfer the healthcare data to the local, or global sites for storage, and computation purposes, as vehicles are having comparatively limited storage and computation power for handling the multimedia files. However, due to the dynamic changes in topology, and lack of centralized monitoring points, this information can be altered, or misused. These security breaches can result in disastrous consequences such as-loss of life or financial frauds. Therefore, to address these issues, a learning automata-assisted distributive intrusion detection system is designed based on clustering. Although there exist a number of applications where the proposed scheme can be applied but, we have taken multimedia-based healthcare application for illustration of the proposed scheme. In the proposed scheme, learning automata (LA) are assumed to be stationed on the vehicles which take clustering decisions intelligently and select one of the members of the group as a cluster-head. The cluster-heads then assist in efficient storage and dissemination of information through a cloud-based infrastructure. To secure the proposed scheme from malicious activities, standard cryptographic technique is used in which the auotmaton learns from the environment and takes adaptive decisions for identification of any malicious activity in the network. A reward and penalty is given by the stochastic environment where an automaton performs its actions so that it updates its action probability vector after getting the reinforcement signal from the environment. The proposed scheme was evaluated using extensive simulations on ns-2 with SUMO. The results obtained indicate that the proposed scheme yields an improvement of 10  {\%} in detection rate of malicious nodes when compared with the existing schemes.",

abstract="Ubiquitous computing is a new kind of computing where devices enhance everyday artefacts and open up previously inaccessible situations for data capture. `Technology paternalism' has been suggested by Spiekermann and Pallas (Poiesis {\&} Praxis: Int J Technol Assess Ethics Sci 4(1):6--18, 2006) as a concept to gauge the social and ethical impact of these new technologies. In this article we explore this concept in the specific setting of UK road maintenance and construction. Drawing on examples from our qualitative fieldwork we suggest that cultural logics such as those reflected in paternalistic health and safety discourse are central in legitimising the introduction of ubiquitous computing technologies. As such, there is little doubt that paternalism plays an essential role in people's reasoning about ubiquitous computing in this setting. We argue, however, that since discourses such as health and safety are used by everyone (including both managers and workers) in the organisation to further their own aims, technologies transcend purely paternalistic conceptualisations and instead become a focal point for ongoing struggles for control between those deploying and using them. This means that the benefits and costs of such new technologies become harder to define from an ethical and social perspective.",

abstract="As IoT technology evolves, developments of ubiquitous computing accelerates. At the same time, threats of privacy exposure also increase since the IoT systems expose the information such as user's location or medical status collected from all sorts of things. To handle the data elaborately, the ubiquitous systems need to employ a technology that provides anonymity to prevent exposure of personal information. The group signature scheme is widely used for a cryptographic base for privacy protection which do not reveal user's identity but prove that he/she is a legitimate user. Recently, a number of researches concerning the basic group signature schemes with a differentiated linkability have been conducted to provide a more flexible service. However, existing researches focused on providing flexible services from the service provider's position. The systems are exposed to high possibilities of unnecessary breach of privacy. In this paper, we define a restrictive linkability for the anonymous services that require an adequate linkability with a minimum user-designated privacy exposure in anonymous services and propose an efficient group signature scheme providing restrictive linkability.",

abstract="As the overall population ages, driving-related accidents and injuries, associated with elderly drivers, have risen. Existing research about elderly drivers mainly focuses on factual data collection and analysis, indicating the elderly's growing fatal accident rates and their different behaviours compared to younger drivers. However, few research has focused on design-led practical solutions to mitigate the elderly's growing fatal accidents, by considering their usability and body conditions, afflicting the elderly, such as decreased vision, hearing, and reaction times. In this paper, first, current worldwide situations on growing fatal accident rates for elderly drivers is reviewed and the key impact factors are identified and discussed with regarding to usability and design trend in the automotive technology for elderly. Second, existing smart vehicle technology-based solutions to promote safe driving are explored and their pros and cons are discussed and analysed. Most of solutions are not created by people with driving difficulties, which are caused by health problems most commonly afflicting the elderly. Thirdly, diverse design-led research activities are taken, such as a survey, observation, and interviews to gain new understanding of what kinds of driving problems elderly drivers have and demonstrate how new system concepts could be developed for the elderly's benefits. Finally, it is found that the elderly's low vision and late reaction are main factors causing their driving difficulties. Based on this finding, usable vehicle system design ideas have been proposed, by utilising facial expression sensing technology as a solution. The proposed solutions would ensure reducing both the elderly's driving problems and high fatal accident rates and provide a more enjoyable driving environment for the elderly population.",

abstract="Pharmacovigilance, and generally applications of natural language processing models to healthcare, have attracted growing attention over the recent years. In particular, drug reactions can be extracted from user reviews posted on the Web, and automated processing of this information represents a novel and exciting approach to personalized medicine and wide-scale drug tests. In medical applications, demographic information regarding the authors of these reviews such as age and gender is of primary importance; however, existing studies usually either assume that this information is available or overlook the issue entirely. In this work, we propose and compare several approaches to automated mining of demographic information from user-generated texts. We compare modern natural language processing techniques, including extensions of topic models and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We apply single-task and multi-task learning approaches to this problem. Based on a real-world dataset mined from a health-related web site, we conclude that while CNNs perform best in terms of predicting demographic information by jointly learning different user attributes, topic models provide additional information and reflect gender-specific and age-specific symptom profiles that may be of interest for a researcher.",

abstract="Due to the enhancing of life quality, increasing of chronic diseases, changing lifestyles, and an expanding life expectancy, rapid population aging requires a new business model that promotes happiness and emphasizes a healthy body and mind through the ``anytime, anywhere well-being'' lifestyle. Recently, lifecare systems using IoT devices are being released as products that are influential on the overall society, and their effectiveness is continuously proven. In addition, based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, diverse companies are conducting investments and research to develop devices as well as solutions that connect to these devices. Accordingly, in this study, a mining-based lifecare-recommendation method using a peer-to-peer dataset and adaptive decision feedback is proposed. In addition to collecting PHRs, the proposed method measures life-logs such as dietary life, life pattern, sleep pattern, life behavior, and job career; the P2P-dataset preprocessed index information; and biometric information using a wearable device. It uses the Open API to collect the health-weather and life-weather index data from public data, and it uses a smart-band-type wearable device known as a biosensor to measure the heart rate, daily activity, and body temperature. It monitors the current status and conditions through the classification of life data, and it mines big data and uses a decision tree to analyze the association rules and correlations, as well as to discover new knowledge patterns. In the peer-to-peer networking, a lifecare recommendation model that uses adaptive decision feedback has been developed for the peer-to-peer platform. This adaptive decision feedback reflects an individual's importance or sensory level. Accordingly, it proposes more individualized and flexible results and can be configured to support intellectual lifecare. A mining-based lifecare-recommendation mobile service can also be developed to enhance the quality of life, as it provides user-based health management and reduces the medical expenses; accordingly, it enhances the service satisfaction and quality in the lifecare field.",

This paper will give an overview of the current technology landscape for sensing and intervening on three behaviors that are central to weight management: diet, physical activity, and sleep. Then five studies that really dig into the possibilities that these new technologies afford will be showcased.

abstract="Experience and socialization are key factors in customer commitment and defection decisions. To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109--126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate. This study's results indicate that the inclusion of social effects increases the predictive power of the customer churn model (Nitzan and Libai, Journal of Marketing 75(6):24--38, 2011), thus contributing to our understanding of the role social networks play in customer decisions.",

abstract="Cohort Study Platforms (CSP) are emerging as a key tool for collecting patient information, providing new research data, and supporting family and patient associations. However they pose new ethics and regulatory challenges since they cross the gap between patients and medical practitioners. One of the critical issues for CSP is to enforce a strict control on access privileges whilst allowing the users to take advantage of the breadth of the available data. We propose Cerberus, a new access control scheme spanning the whole life-cycle of access right management: design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, operations. Cerberus enables switching from a dual world, where CSP data can be accessed either from the users who entered it or fully de-identified, to an access-when-required world, where patients, practitioners and researchers can access focused medical data through explicit authorisation by the data owner. Efficient access control requires application-specific access rights, as well as the ability to restrict these rights when they are not used. Cerberus is implemented and evaluated in the context of the GENIDA project, an international CSP for Genetically determined Intellectual Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorders. As a result of this study, the software is made available for the community, and validated specifications for CSPs are given.",

In this paper, an effective cloud computing system is proposed which predicts MERS-CoV-infected patients using Bayesian belief network and provides geographic-based risk assessment to control its outbreak. The proposed system is tested on synthetic data generated for 0.2 million users. System provided high accuracy for classification and appropriate geographic-based risk assessment. The key point of this paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV users on Google maps so that possibly infected users can be quarantined as early as possible.

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) is focused on providing assistance to people primarily in their natural environment. Over the past decade, the AAL domain has evolved at a fast pace in various directions. The stakeholders of AAL are not only limited to patients, but also include their relatives, social services, health workers, and care agencies. In fact, AAL aims at increasing the life quality of patients, their relatives and the health care providers with a holistic approach. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the AAL domain, presenting a systematic analysis of over 10 years of relevant literature focusing on the stakeholders' needs, bridging the gap of existing reviews which focused on technologies. The findings of this review clearly show that until now the AAL domain neglects the view of the entire AAL ecosystem. Furthermore, the proposed solutions seem to be tailored more on the basis of the available existing technologies, rather than supporting the various stakeholders' needs. Another major lack that this review is pointing out is a missing adequate evaluation of the various solutions. Finally, it seems that, as the domain of AAL is pretty new, it is still in its incubation phase. Thus, this review calls for moving the AAL domain to a more mature phase with respect to the research approaches.",

abstract="When everything you see is data, what ethical principles apply? This paper argues that first-person digital recording technologies challenge traditional institutional approaches to research ethics, but that this makes ethics governance more important, not less so. We review evolving ethical concerns across four fields: Visual ethics; ubiquitous computing; mobile health; and grey literature from applied or market research. Collectively, these bodies of literature identify new challenges to traditional notions of informed consent, anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, beneficence and maleficence. Challenges come from the ever-increasing power, breadth and multi-functional integration of recording technologies, and the ubiquity and normalization of their use by participants. Some authors argue that these evolving relationships mean that institutional ethics governance procedures are irrelevant or no longer apply. By contrast, we argue that the fundamental principles of research ethics frameworks have become even more important for the protection of research participants, and that institutional frameworks need to adapt to keep pace with the ever-increasing power of recording technologies and the consequent risks to privacy. We conclude with four recommendations for efforts to ensure that contemporary visual recording research is held appropriately accountable to ethical standards: (i) minimizing the detail, scope, integration and retention of captured data, and limiting its accessibility; (ii) formulating an approach to ethics that takes in both the `common rule' approaches privileging anonymity and confidentiality together with principles of contextual judgement and consent as an ongoing process; (iii) developing stronger ethical regulation of research outside academia; (iv) engaging the public and research participants in the development of ethical guidelines.",

abstract="In recent years, the rapid development of computer science and technology brings health care into the information era. As a typical representation, wireless body area networks (WBANs) has also promoted the development of medical technology into a higher field. However, collecting data from users seriously affects personal privacy and security, that WBANs needs to overcome. In order to resolve the flaws of the existing secure authentication protocols in WBANs, we propose a lightweight implicit authentication protocol based on the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vantone (ECQV) algorithm. Moreover, we take advantage of the bidirectional key chain to design a group key management protocol between the personal digital assistance (PDA) and each of cluster head sensor nodes. The security and performance analysis show that our protocol can be performed with perfect forward security and backward security in data communication. In addition, the experimental simulation and theoretic analysis show that our protocol is more suitable for WBANs.",

abstract="In an accurate and timely manner, capturing the risk signals for a specific emerging technology from academic publications is important to facilitate risk governance and to reduce the potential negative impact on socioeconomic systems. In the past decade, three-dimensional printing (3D printing) has become a promising emerging technology. To identify the relevant research on risk analysis for 3D printing, ``term clumping'' on ``risk analysis'' is explored using a quantitative method, and an integrated framework for risk identification is proposed with regard to 3D printing. This method involves a variation of TF*IDF and several new metrics for a Boolean query of the literature. The empirical results for the risk analysis studies of 3D printing show that, to date, very little attention has been paid to the relevant topics. However, although the risk signals of 3D printing are still weak and dispersed in many different categories, the potential threats to human health, cyber-security, and the environment are revealed in some facets. This enables initiation of strategies for anticipatory governance, involving science and technology policies and regulations.",

abstract="Nanotechnology is a new and very promising area of research which will allow several new applications to be created in different fields, such as, biological, medical, environmental, military, agricultural, industrial and consumer goods. This paper focuses specifically on nanocommunications, which will allow interconnected devices, at the nano-scale, to achieve collaborative tasks, greatly changing the paradigm in the fields described. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm which allows nanomachines to exchange information using molecules as carrier. This is the most promising nanocommunication method within nanonetworks, since it can use bio-inspired techniques, inherit from studied biological systems, which makes the connection of biologic and man-made systems a easier process. At this point, the biggest challenges in these type of nanocommunication are to establish feasible and reliable techniques that will allow information to be encoded, and mechanisms that ensure a molecular communication between different nodes. This paper focus on creating concepts and techniques to tackle these challenges, and establishing new foundations on which future work can be developed. The created concepts and techniques are then applied in an envisioned medical application, which is based on a molecular nanonetwork deployed inside the Human body. The goal of this medical application is to automatously monitor endocrine diseases using the benefits of nanonetworks, which in turn connects with the internet, thus creating a Internet of NanoThings system. The concepts and techniques developed are evaluated by performing several simulations and comparing with other researches, and the results and discussions are presented on the later sections of this paper.",

abstract="Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is the most convenient, cost-effective, accurate, and non-invasive technology for e-health monitoring. The performance of WBAN may be disturbed when coexisting with other wireless networks. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive study and in-depth analysis of coexistence issues and interference mitigation solutions in WBAN technologies. A thorough survey of state-of-the art research in WBAN coexistence issues is conducted. The survey classified, discussed, and compared the studies according to the parameters used to analyze the coexistence problem. Solutions suggested by the studies are then classified according to the followed techniques and concomitant shortcomings are identified. Moreover, the coexistence problem in WBAN technologies is mathematically analyzed and formulas are derived for the probability of successful channel access for different wireless technologies with the coexistence of an interfering network. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted using OPNET with several real-life scenarios to evaluate the impact of coexistence interference on different WBAN technologies. In particular, three main WBAN wireless technologies are considered: IEEE 802.15.6, IEEE 802.15.4, and low-power WiFi. The mathematical analysis and the simulation results are discussed and the impact of interfering network on the different wireless technologies is compared and analyzed. The results show that an interfering network (e.g., standard WiFi) has an impact on the performance of WBAN and may disrupt its operation. In addition, using low-power WiFi for WBANs is investigated and proved to be a feasible option compared to other wireless technologies.",

The machine learning methods used in bioinformatics are iterative and parallel. These methods can be scaled to handle big data using the distributed and parallel computing technologies. Usually big data tools perform computation in batch mode and are not optimized for iterative processing and high data dependency among operations. In the recent years, parallel, incremental, and multi-view machine learning algorithms have been proposed. Similarly, graph-based architectures and in-memory big data tools have been developed to minimize I/O cost and optimize iterative processing. However, standard big data architectures are still lacking. Also appropriate tools are not available for many important bioinformatics problems, such as fast construction of co-expression and regulatory networks and salient module identification, detection of complexes over growing protein-protein interaction data, fast analysis of massive DNA, RNA, and protein sequence data, and fast querying on incremental and heterogeneous disease networks.

abstract="It is expected that in the next year, over a billion wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes will be deployed throughout the world, constituting a wide variety of sensor applications. In such a domain, management of the randomly distributed sensor networks is complicated by issues such as knowledge of energy consumption and coverage, extended lifetimes and demands for improved quality of service parameters. Several researchers have addressed these issues through their own innovations and discoveries of different schemes, methods, techniques or mathematical models and architectures or applications, using a variety of node designs. This in turn, has lead to multiple different choices of hardware and software options. However, this has not simplified the process of setting up application testbeds considering energy consumption. There is no readily available solution for setting up a WSN with user selected profiles and parameters. Multiple communication protocols, routing protocols, signal calibration and propagation methods, data aggregation schemes, clustering formations with multiple variations have been proposed for different research objectives. This paper proposes a method for consolidating all the initiatives and integrating these in a service panel framework that helps manage the desired WSN with options to set up an individual WSN profile and supporting the energy engineering processes involved in the WSN.",

abstract="An increasing percentage of the population needs assistance services for a wide range of activities related to their independent living, which can be delivered either by humans or by machines. While cloud computing and emerging ICT solutions have introduced new types of services and service delivery paradigms, it remains costly and difficult to set up and market assistance services addressing the needs of very narrow end-user groups. The current work presents the design of a novel open-source infrastructure (web-based platform) which enables diverse stakeholders to easily set up web-based assistance-on-demand platform instances. Each of these AoD instances can be used by service providers to register and offer assistance-on-demand (AoD) services for catering individual needs of persons with disabilities. In this way, narrow end-user groups can be reached and enjoy a gamut of assistance services. The AoD platform is implemented in the context of a larger Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), which is being developed in the context of the Prosperity4All project. The functional requirements for the design of the AoD infrastructure were iteratively fine-tuned through the definition and analysis of representative use models (sets of personas and use cases). The AoD platform architecture consists of two major components: front-end (GUI) and back-end (service infrastructure). Their implementation is mainly based on the Django framework which enables a Model--Template--View (MTV) software architectural pattern with highly configurable and flexible components. The evaluation of a demonstration instance of the AoD platform with end-users identified its advantages and pointed out additional functionality needed: multi-language, multi-modality, embedded social media feeding, dedicated menu for highly flexible service, etc. The overall perceived usefulness of the specific demonstration AoD platform instance that underwent evaluation was higher than 80{\%}. The proposed AoD platform provides a flexible and sufficiently generic web-based infrastructure for the cost-effective setup, registration and web publication of services that can accommodate a highly diverse range of assistance needs. Furthermore, it is suitable for use by a wide range of different stakeholder/user groups interested in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities or otherwise at risk of exclusion.",

However, people are vulnerable to errors and biases in the underlying data and algorithms, especially those with mental illness. Algorithms based on big data from seemingly unrelated sources may create obstacles to community integration. Voluntary online self-disclosure and constant tracking blur traditional concepts of public versus private data, medical versus non-medical data, and human versus automated decision-making. In contrast to sharing sensitive information with a physician in a confidential relationship, there may be numerous readers of information revealed online; data may be sold repeatedly; used in proprietary algorithms; and are effectively permanent.

This paper presents such a framework that integrates both a computer vision component and heterogeneous sensors with unanimous semantic representation and interpretation, while it also addresses challenges for realistic applications, such as fast, efficient image analysis and ontology-based temporal interpretation models. The framework is validated through an application in clinical dementia assessment yielding positive results and fruitful conclusions for the proposed semantic fusion of vision and sensor observations.",

abstract="The incessant spurt of research activities to augment capabilities of resource-constrained mobile devices by leveraging heterogeneous cloud resources has created a new research impetus called mobile cloud computing. However, this rapid relocation to the cloud has fueled security and privacy concerns as users' data leave owner's protection sphere and enter the cloud. Significant efforts have been devoted by academia and research community to study and build secure frameworks in cloud environment, but there exists a research gap for comprehensive study of security frameworks in mobile cloud computing environment. Therefore, we aim to conduct a comprehensive survey to analyze various cryptographic, biometric and multifactor lightweight solutions for data security in mobile cloud. This survey highlights the current security issues in mobile cloud environment and infrastructure, investigates various data security frameworks and provides a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art data security frameworks and deep insight into open research issues for ensuring security and privacy of data in mobile cloud computing platform.",

title="Improved peak detection technique for robust PPG-based heartrate monitoring system on smartphones",
journal="Multimedia Tools and Applications",
year="2017",
month="Oct",
day="17",
abstract="Heartrate monitoring can be very decisive in terms of detecting heart-related diseases in early stages. Given that smartphones are used almost ubiquitously by humans on a daily basis and that they are equipped with several sensors and a powerful CPU, they are the ideal tools to accomplish daily heartrate monitoring. Many studies have shown the possibility of monitoring the heartrate in a very accurate way by using smartphone camera and the photo-plethysmography technique. However, in real cases, when using a smartphone camera as the input sensor, the pulse signal usually contains noise caused by fingertip movements, pressure changes between the smartphone camera and the fingertip, or changes in ambient light intensity. Hence, many techniques have been proposed to filter and detect real peaks in the pulse signal and avoid noise peaks. Most of those state-of-the-art techniques rely on the assumption that real peaks are those having the maximum values in their respective cycles. In some cases, the assumption is not correct, which decreases the accuracy of peak detection. Hence, this paper proposes a novel method to detect a pulse signal's real peaks. The proposed method first smoothens a pulse signal by using a second-order Butterworth band-pass filter over a wide frequency range. Then, it considers the local minima of the signal as peaks and builds an optimization tree based on statistical properties, such as uniformity of peak time locations, peak count within a period, and variance in times elapsed between adjacent peaks, to detect combinations of peaks that optimize the heartrate computation. Results from experiments conducted using synthetic and real signals show that the proposed method can detect a pulse signal's real peaks with higher precision as compared to conventional methods, and is very robust to signal noises. The proposed method has a significant heartrate estimation accuracy in various real scenarios and across smartphone models; its error rate is as low as 0.8588{\textpm}0.0653 beats per minute, even in cases of signals with extensive noise.",

abstract="In emergency situations, actions that save lives and limit the impact of hazards are crucial. In order to act, situational awareness is needed to decide what to do. Geolocalized photos and video of the situations as they evolve can be crucial in better understanding them and making decisions faster. Cameras are almost everywhere these days, either in terms of smartphones, installed CCTV cameras, UAVs or others. However, this poses challenges in big data and information overflow. Moreover, most of the time there are no disasters at any given location, so humans aiming to detect sudden situations may not be as alert as needed at any point in time. Consequently, computer vision tools can be an excellent decision support. The number of emergencies where computer vision tools has been considered or used is very wide, and there is a great overlap across related emergency research. Researchers tend to focus on state-of-the-art systems that cover the same emergency as they are studying, obviating important research in other fields. In order to unveil this overlap, the survey is divided along four main axes: the types of emergencies that have been studied in computer vision, the objective that the algorithms can address, the type of hardware needed and the algorithms used. Therefore, this review provides a broad overview of the progress of computer vision covering all sorts of emergencies.",

abstract="Since heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to evaluate the physiological status of the human body, devices specifically designed for such applications are needed. To this end, we developed a smart electrocardiography (ECG) patch. The smart patch measures ECG using three electrodes integrated into the patch, filters the measured signals to minimize noise, performs analog-to-digital conversion, and detects R-peaks. The measured raw ECG data and the interval between the detected R-peaks can be recorded to enable long-term HRV analysis. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the built-in R-wave detection, robustness of the device under motion, and applicability to the evaluation of mental stress. The R-peak detection results obtained with the device exhibited a sensitivity of 99.29{\%}, a positive predictive value of 100.00{\%}, and an error of 0.71{\%}. The device also exhibited less motional noise than conventional ECG recording, being stable up to a walking speed of 5 km/h. When applied to mental stress analysis, the device evaluated the variation in HRV parameters in the same way as a normal ECG, with very little difference. This device can help users better understand their state of health and provide physicians with more reliable data for objective diagnosis.",

This opens the prospect of ``neurocrime'': extending the range of computer-crime to neural devices. This paper explores a type of neurocrime that we call brain-hacking as it aims at the illicit access to and manipulation of neural information and computation. As neural computation underlies cognition, behavior and our self-determination as persons, a careful analysis of the emerging risks of malicious brain-hacking is paramount, and ethical safeguards against these risks should be considered early in design and regulation. This contribution is aimed at raising awareness of the emerging risk of malicious brain-hacking and takes a first step in developing an ethical and legal reflection on those risks.",

To a person in a mobile environment, awareness, comfort, efficiency, immediacy, mobility, preparedness, and responsiveness were considered as more important types of the life quality. To improve these, the most effective smart technologies were concluded as smart mobile services, smart phone, smart glasses/spectacles/contact lens, and smart surveillance camera. The contribution of this study includes a systematic procedure for applying smart technologies to improving the life quality of a mobile person, and a novel method that involves applying the Kano quality model to quantify life quality from several innovative viewpoints.

abstract="Mobile crowd sensing significantly facilitates a broad range of emerging applications by treating mobile devices of ordinary users as basic sensing units to distribute sensing tasks and collect sensing data. Owing to the continuity of data sensing and richness of content, resource-constrained mobile devices always outsource their collected data into the cloud for file sharing. The existing work enables only batch decryption limited to RSA algorithm and merely allows one specific file to be shared among multiple authorized receivers by exploiting the technique of attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this paper, a generalized efficient batch cryptosystem GBC and its extension GBCS are firstly proposed to achieve both batch encryption and batch decryption from any public key encryption algorithm. Then, our proposed GBC is further extended to FMFS, TMFS and MMFS to address secure multiple file sharing in the cloud-assisted mobile crowd sensing network, respectively for fine-grained multi-receiver multi-file sharing, file authority transfer and multiple file owners's settings. Finally, formal security proof is given to show our proposed generalized efficient batch cryptosystems GBC, GBCS and secure multiple file sharing schemes are respectively secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2) in the random oracle model and under the assumption on the computational hardness of the subset decision problem in the standard model. Extensive evaluations illustrate our secure multiple file sharing in cloud-assisted crowd sensing network based on the newly-devised GBC dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art in storage, computational and communication overhead.",

The proposed system is highly energy efficient that consumes only 165 mW power and runs on 5 VDC source. The implemented solution employs an IR thermographic sensor of industry grade along with AT Mega 328 breakout board. Ordinarily, the IR sensor is placed 1.5--30 cm away from human forehead (i.e., non-invasive) and measured the raw data in terms of skin and ambient temperature which is then converted using appropriate approximation formula to find out core body temperature. The raw data is plotted, visualized, and stored instantaneously in a local machine by means of two tools such as Makerplot, and JAVA-JAR. The test is performed when human object is in complete rest and after 10 min of walk. Achieved results are compared with the CoreTemp CM-210 sensor (by Terumo, Japan) which is calculated to be 0.7 {\textdegree}F different from the average value of BCT, obtained by the proposed IR sensor system. Upon a slight modification, the presented model can be connected with a remotely placed Internet of Things cloud service, which may be useful to inform and predict the user's core body temperature through a probabilistic view.

abstract="The explosion of data grows at a rate of roughly five trillion bits a second, giving rise to greater urgency in conceptualizing the infosphere (Floridi 2011) and understanding its implications for knowledge and public policy. Philosophers of technology and information technologists alike who wrestle with ontological and epistemological questions of digital information tend to emphasize, as Floridi does, information as our new ecosystem and human beings as interconnected informational organisms, inforgs at home in ambient intelligence. But the linguistic and conceptual representations of Big Data---the massive volume of both structured and unstructured data---and the real world practice of data-mining for patterns and meaningful interpretation of evidence reveal tension and ambiguity in the bold promise of data analytics. This paper explores the tacit epistemology of the rhetoric and representation of Big Data and suggests a richer account of its ambiguities and the paradox of its real world materiality. We argue that Big Data should be recognized as manifesting multiple and conflicting trajectories that reflect human intentionality and particular patterns of power and authority. Such patterns require attentive exploration and moral appraisal if we are to resist simplistic informationist ontologies of Big Data, and the subtle forms of control in the political ecology of Big Data that undermine its promise as transformational knowledge.",

abstract="Nowadays, with more than 50 {\%} of the world's population living in urban areas, cities are facing important environmental challenges. Among them, air pollution has emerged as one of the most important concerns, taking into account the social costs related to the effect of polluted air. According to a report of the World Health Organization, approximately seven million people die each year from the effects of air pollution. Despite this fact, the same report suggests that cities could greatly improve their air quality through local measures by exploiting modern and efficient solutions for smart infrastructures. Ideally, this approach requires insights of how pollutant levels change over time in specific locations. To tackle this problem, we present an evolutionary system for the prediction of pollutants levels based on a recently proposed variant of genetic programming. This system is designed to predict the amount of ozone level, based on the concentration of other pollutants collected by sensors disposed in critical areas of a city. An analysis of data related to the region of Yuen Long (one of the most polluted areas of China), shows the suitability of the proposed system for addressing the problem at hand.

abstract="As a significant part of the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has attract much attention in this years. In WBANs, sensors placed in or around the human body collect the sensitive data of the body and transmit it through an open wireless channel in which the messages may be intercepted, modified, etc. Recently, Wang et al. presented a new anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs and claimed that their scheme can solve the security problems in the previous schemes. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that their scheme cannot withstand impersonation attack. Either an adversary or a malicious legal client could impersonate another legal client to the application provider. In this paper, we give the detailed weakness analysis of Wang et al.'s scheme at first. Then we present a novel anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs and prove that it's secure under a random oracle model. At last, we demonstrate that our presented anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs is more suitable for practical application than Wang et al.'s scheme due to better security and performance. Compared with Wang et al.'s scheme, the computation cost of our scheme in WBANs has reduced by about 31.58 {\%}.",

It is predicted that the safety analysis techniques now in place are quite difficult to address the potential risks which weaken the era. A novel approach to analyzing different crucial criteria in various industrial sectors is explained carefully in this work. In this unique approach, accident reduction model technique is applied to determine the respective weights of three main criteria and seventeen sub-criteria as a way of enriching the decision-making process while in a problem. A survey was initiated in different industrial sectors to obtain reliable data for the research. The results show that the main criteria `human safety' acquired a weight of 72.5{\%} while the respective weights of primary criteria machine security and work environment safety fall to 8.9 and 18.4{\%}. The weight of the main criteria, human safety indicates that the sub-criteria such as eye protection, manual lifting, material handling practices, firefighting drills, training and safety officers are implemented to a greater extent in most of the surveyed industries.",

We simplify this problem as recognizing pathological brains from healthy brains. First, 12 fractional Fourier entropy (FRFE) features were extracted from each brain image. Next, we submit those features to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. Two improvements were proposed for MLP. One improvement is the pruning technique that determines the optimal hidden neuron number. We compared three pruning techniques: dynamic pruning (DP), Bayesian detection boundaries (BDB), and Kappa coefficient (KC). The other improvement is to use the adaptive real-coded biogeography-based optimization (ARCBBO) to train the biases and weights of MLP. The experiments showed that the proposed FRFE{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}KC-MLP{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}ARCBBO achieved an average accuracy of 99.53 {\%} based on 10 repetitions of K-fold cross validation, which was better than 11 recent PBDS methods.",

abstract="Based on the concept of data physicalization, we developed Vital + Morph, an interactive surface for remote connection and awareness of clinical data. It enables users located in remote places to monitor and feel the vital signs measured from a hospitalized person through shape-change. We propose shape-changing interfaces as a way of making data physicalization a richer, intriguing and memorable experience that communicates complex information and insights about data. To demonstrate and validate our proposed concept, we developed an exploratory study about the design and its implications. For evaluating the social impact of shape-changing interfaces in the context of remote monitoring, we presented Vital + Morph in several Media Art festivals. We collected and analyzed the feedback from the visitors during the exhibitions, and discussed the possibilities of the proposed system. A preliminary evaluation shows how shape-changing displays are perceived by users, which establishes not only the potential benefits but also highlights the concerns that several users have raised. Through this study, we aim to contribute to the design of remote monitoring systems by providing a novel approach for displaying clinical data that consider the richness of the physical world. In today's information-driven society, we should not just focus on how abstract data are collected and analyzed, but also on how it can be presented and incorporated into our daily lives.",

This is the radical change in the ``business model'' of a company related to the monetization of the data it collects. The biggest question for a company is no longer deciding if it should launch new products, but rather taking advantage of available (structured or unstructured) data and to know how to develop a high performance and design an appropriate mining to efficiently analyze big data and to find the useful things from it. The objective of this paper is to show that the challenges of the era of ``data revolution'' focus on data uses.

abstract="Numerous companies in manufacturing industries have ``servitized'' their value propositions to address issues on product commoditization and sustainability. A key component of servitization is informatics, which transforms product and customer data into information for customers. In this study, informatics-based service is defined as a type of service wherein informatics is crucial to customer value creation. Despite the importance of this concept, studies on the design of informatics-based services in manufacturing industries are rare. This paper reports on two case studies on such designs. Informatics-based services have been designed for a major Korean automobile manufacturer and the Korea Transportation Safety Authority (TS) based on their large vehicle-related databases. The first case study with the automobile manufacturer aims to design vehicle operations and health management services for passenger vehicle drivers while the second study with TS focuses on the design of driving safety enhancement services for commercial vehicle (i.e., bus, taxi, and truck) drivers. Based on the case studies, this paper discusses various aspects of informatics-based service design in manufacturing industries. This study would assist researchers and practitioners in designing new informatics-based services and contribute to promoting and inspiring research on intelligent services in manufacturing industries under the current information economy.",

In the first study, we used self-report techniques to gather data, and found that previous technological experience had a significant effect on the perceived anxiety of elders; while on the second study, we used indirect observation techniques to gather data, and found that previous technological experience had a significant effect on the perceived enjoyment of elders. After a further analysis of the video recordings of the playing sessions, we identified that elders developed two different approaches to their using the application (explore-and-learn and score-and-compete), which could be related to their previous technological experience, and explain the identified differences. We observed that in the presence of problems, the response of participants was different depending on the adopted behavior. Based on this evidence, we distilled a set of preliminary guidelines to foster or inhibit certain behaviors and outcomes related to the effect of previous experience that were observed during our evaluation studies of virtual tools for the cognitive stimulation and physical activation of the elderly.",

journal="Software Quality Journal",

month="Nov",
day="02",
abstract="Software coupling involves dependencies among pieces of software called modules. Different types of coupling will dictate the manner whereby software modules interact and will result in different approaches to mutual function calls and return values, which can affect software quality attributes. Undoubtedly, coupling has been one of the most critical factors for supporting software modularity because it affects such important software quality attributes as reusability, readability, and maintainability. It is no surprise that coupling can affect energy efficiency. Recently, energy efficiency has increasingly been recognized as a critical software quality attribute, particularly for embedded software, including smartphone applications. Unfortunately, few studies have been conducted to date concerning coupling in developing energy-efficient and modular software, other than general studies on energy consumption and resource overutilization in the context of modularity. In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between energy consumption and software coupling. In particular, we aim to determine whether it is possible to control energy consumption by applying different types of software coupling and, if so, how this might be done. We have performed a large number of experiments from which we have gained insight, although that insight might not be applicable to all possible types of coupling that are feasible, to help guide software engineers in developing energy-efficient embedded software. From the experimental results, we observe that overall ``data'' coupling reduces energy consumption when a large amount of data must be passed from one module to another, whereas ``common'' coupling is preferred when continuous memory references are needed, although energy consumption can also be somewhat dependent upon the operating environment. We describe such insights into the relationship between energy consumption and software coupling.",

However, the financial evaluation of intangible benefits associated with IT/IS investments in general and investments in innovative IT/IS in particular still remains a problem area of high relevance to decision makers. As a consequence, investment decisions are still taken by practitioners as an ``act of faith''. With this in mind, it is our primary aim to develop a quantification model for the financial assessment of intangible benefits concerning investments in innovative IT/IS. Based on an augmented reality and smart glasses application scenario from the construction domain, we demonstrate how intangible benefits of innovative IT/IS investments can be visualised and measured more effectively by means of utility effect chains and system dynamics prior to their incorporation into a cost--benefit analysis. Based on design science research, the quantification model is developed by means of a systematic literature review and evaluated using the augmented reality application scenario in construction. The model can serve as an aid to the managerial decision making process by providing an enhanced understanding of the various tangible and intangible benefits associated with the investment.",

abstract="Falls are reported to be the leading causes of accidental deaths among elderly people. Automatic detection of falls from video sequences is an assistant technology for low-cost health care systems. In this paper, we present a novel slow feature analysis based framework for fall detection in a house care environment. Firstly, a foreground human body is extracted by a background subtraction technique. After morphological operations, the human silhouette is refined and covered by a fitted ellipse. Secondly, six shape features are quantified from the covered silhouette to represent different human postures. With the help of the learned slow feature functions, the shape feature sequences are transformed into slow feature sequences with discriminative information about human actions. To represent the fall incidents, the squared first order temporal derivatives of the slow features are accumulated into a classification vector. Lastly, falls are distinguished from other daily actions, such as walking, crouching, and sitting, by the trained directed acyclic graph support vector machine. Experiments on the multiple-camera fall dataset and the SDUFall dataset demonstrate that our method is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving 94.00{\%} recognition rate on the former dataset and 96.57{\%} on the latter one.",

journal="Wireless Networks",
year="2016",
month="Dec",
day="28",
abstract="Single-path routing is widely used in wireless networks due to low resource consumption. However, it is vulnerable to link failure because such a failure may adversely affect an entire path. To overcome this, multipath routing has been proposed providing fault-tolerance. In this paper, we propose a novel multipath routing protocol called traffic-aware stateless multipath routing (TSMR) based on an overlaid tree topology comprising two topologies, namely, bounded degree tree (BDT) and root-oriented directional tree (RODT). BDT is strong on reducing routing overhead, and RODT is resilient against lossy links. By synergistically overlaying them, TSMR dynamically selects the local optimal path according to the given traffic flow and the failure on the primary path. In particular, TSMR enables stateless and low overhead routing despite multipath routing by keeping only one-hop neighbors to maintain multiple paths. To evaluate TSMR, we conducted simulations with a shadowing model reflecting lossy links, and compared with single and multipath routing protocols, such as ZTR, STR, AODV, and RPL. The simulation results show that the overall performance of TSMR surpasses that of others for packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, control overhead, memory consumption, and power consumption regardless of network size, number of sessions, and traffic flow.",

However, releasing user data could also seriously threaten user privacy. It is possible to directly collect sensitive information from released user data without user permissions. Furthermore, third party users can also infer sensitive information contained in released data in a latent manner by utilizing data mining techniques. In this paper, we formally define these two types of threats as inherent data privacy and latent data privacy and construct a data-sanitization strategy that can optimize the tradeoff between data utility and customized two types of privacy. The key novel idea lies that the developed strategy can combat against powerful third party users with broad knowledge about users and launching optimal inference attacks. We show that our strategy does not reduce the benefit brought by user data much, while sensitive information can still be protected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that preserves both inherent data privacy and latent data privacy.",

We conducted a conjoint study, comprising more than 3000 participants, to investigate consumers' data sharing sensitivities along six dimensions of context and across ten private and public sectors covering the whole economy. We find that nearly all consumers (99.9 {\%} of our sample) want to share personal data with organizations if the benefits and terms suffice their needs. Second, we show that consumers clearly discriminate between organizations from various industry sectors when it comes to their willingness to share their data. Third, we find that context of sharing personal data is more important in the consumers' decision making than the actual data itself. Further, we provide evidence that the right to be forgotten can significantly increase consumers' willingness to share their data.",

abstract="Advanced sensing and internet of things bring the big data, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for data-driven knowledge discovery. However, it is common that a large number of variables (or predictors, features) are involved in the big data. Complex interdependence structures among variables pose significant challenges on the traditional framework of predictive modeling. This paper presents a new methodology of self-organizing network to characterize the interrelationships among variables and cluster them into homogeneous subgroups for predictive modeling. Specifically, we develop a new approach, namely nonlinear coupling analysis to measure variable-to-variable interdependence structures. Further, each variable is represented as a node in the complex network. Nonlinear-coupling forces move these nodes to derive a self-organizing topology of the network. As such, variables are clustered into sub-network communities. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms traditional variable clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and oblique principal component analysis, but also effectively identifies interdependent structures among variables and further improves the performance of predictive modeling. Additionally, real-world case study shows that the proposed method yields an average sensitivity of 96.80{\%} and an average specificity of 92.62{\%} in the identification of myocardial infarctions using sparse parameters of vectorcardiogram representation models. The proposed new idea of self-organizing network is generally applicable for predictive modeling in many disciplines that involve a large number of highly-redundant variables.",

pages="173--194",
abstract="Delay tolerant networks (DTNs) are characterized by delay and intermittent connectivity. Satisfactory network functioning in a DTN relies heavily on co-ordination among participating nodes. However, in practice, such co-ordination cannot be taken for granted due to possible misbehaviour by relay nodes. Routing in a DTN is, therefore, vulnerable to various attacks, which adversely affect network performance. Several strategies have been proposed in the literature to alleviate such vulnerabilities---they vary widely in terms of throughput, detection time, overhead etc. One key challenge is to arrive at a tradeoff between detection time and overhead. We observe that the existing table-based reactive strategies to combat Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in DTN suffer from two major drawbacks: high overhead and slow detection. In this paper, we propose three secure, light-weight and time-efficient routing algorithms for detecting DoS attacks (Blackhole and Grey-hole attacks) in the Spray {\&} Focus routing protocol. The proposed algorithms are based on use of a small fraction of privileged (trusted) nodes. The first strategy, called TN, outperforms the existing table-based strategy with 20--30 {\%} lesser detection time, 20--25 {\%} higher malicious node detection and negligible overhead. The other two strategies, CTN{\_}MI and CTN{\_}RF explore the novel idea that trusted nodes are able to utilize each others' information/experience using their long range connectivity as and when available. Simulations performed using an enhanced ONE simulator reveals that investing in enabling connectivity among trusted nodes (as in CTN{\_}RF) can have significant performance benefits.",

This paper reviews the literature on `Big Data and supply chain management (SCM)', dating back to 2006 and provides a thorough insight into the field by using the techniques of bibliometric and network analyses. We evaluate 286 articles published in the past 10 years and identify the top contributing authors, countries and key research topics. Furthermore, we obtain and compare the most influential works based on citations and PageRank. Finally, we identify and propose six research clusters in which scholars could be encouraged to expand Big Data research in SCM. We contribute to the literature on Big Data by discussing the challenges of current research, but more importantly, by identifying and proposing these six research clusters and future research directions.

pages="909--933",
abstract="The monitoring and assessment of the fetus condition are considered to be among the most important obstetric issues to consider during pregnancy and the prenatal period. Monitoring the fetal condition is required to detect the presence of any abnormalities in the oxygen supply to the fetus early in the antenatal or labor period. Early detection can prevent permanent brain damage and death, both of which may arise from suffocation caused by fetal disease, hypoxic-ischemic injury in the neonatal brain, or chronic fetal asphyxia. In this paper, we propose a new signal-fitting method, FitMine, that identifies the fetal condition by analyzing fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals that are non-invasively measured by cardiotocography (CTG). FitMine is a novel nonlinear dynamic model that reflects the relation between the FHR and UC signals; it combines the chaotic population model and unscented Kalman filter algorithm. The proposed method has several benefits. These are: (a) change-point detection: the proposed method can detect significant pattern variations such as high or low peaks changing suddenly in the FHR and UC signals; (b) parameter-free: it is performed automatically without the requirement for the user to enter input parameters; (c) scalability: FitMine is linearly scalable according to the size of the input data; and (d) applicability: the proposed model can be applied to detect abnormal signs in various domains including electroencephalogram data, epidemic data, temperature data, in addition to CTG recordings.",

In order to guarantee security of this data over open networks, a secure data transmission mechanism between WBAN and application provider's servers is of necessity. Modified medical data does not provide a true reflection of an individuals state of health and its subsequent use for diagnosis could lead to an irreversible medical condition. In this paper, we propose a lightweight certificateless signcryption scheme for secure transmission of data between WBAN and servers. Our proposed scheme not only provides confidentiality of data and authentication in a single logical step, it is lightweight and resistant to key escrow attacks. We further provide security proof that our scheme provides indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack in random oracle model. Compared with two other Diffie-Hellman based signcryption schemes proposed by Barbosa and Farshim (BF) and another by Yin and Liang (YL), our scheme consumes 46 {\%} and 8 {\%} less energy during signcryption than BF and YL scheme respectively.",

abstract="Activity  recognition in smart environments is an evolving research problem due to the advancement and proliferation of sensing, monitoring and actuation technologies to make it possible for large scale and real deployment. While activities in smart home are interleaved, complex and volatile; the number of inhabitants in the environment is also dynamic. A key challenge in designing robust smart home activity recognition approaches is to exploit the users' spatiotemporal behavior and location, focus on the availability of multitude of devices capable of providing different dimensions of information and fulfill the underpinning needs for scaling the system beyond a single user or a home environment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for recognizing complex activities of daily living (ADL), that lie in between the two extremes of intensive use of body-worn sensors and the use of ambient sensors. Our approach harnesses the power of simple ambient sensors (e.g., motion sensors) to provide additional `hidden' context (e.g., room-level location) of an individual, and then combines this context with smartphone-based sensing of micro-level postural/locomotive states. The major novelty is our focus on multi-inhabitant environments, where we show how the use of spatiotemporal constraints along with multitude of data sources can be used to significantly improve the accuracy and computational overhead of traditional activity recognition based approaches such as coupled-hidden Markov models. Experimental results on two separate smart home datasets demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of complex ADL classification by over 30 {\%}, compared to pure smartphone-based solutions.",

Geoweb and remote sensing technologies, companies, and knowledges are imbricated in this assemblage of algorithmic security.

This paper aims to identify specific stress region(s) in the VA space by combining self-reported ratings (pairs of VA) and physiological signals (skin conductance). To this end, 31 healthy volunteers participated in an experiment by performing five stressful interaction tasks while their skin conductance was monitored. The selected interaction tasks were most frequently listed as stressful by a separate group of 15 interviewees. After each task, participants expressed their perceived emotional experience using the VA rating space. Our findings show which regions in the VA rating space may reliably indicate self-reported stress that is in alignment with one's measured skin conductance while using interactive applications. One additional important contribution of this work is the proposed approach for the empirical identification of affect regions in the VA space based on physiological signals.",

To address these challenges, this paper investigates a cloud-based paradigm of predictive maintenance based on mobile agent to enable timely information acquisition, sharing and utilization for improved accuracy and reliability in fault diagnosis, remaining service life prediction, and maintenance scheduling. In the new paradigm, a low-cost cloud sensing and computing node is firstly developed with embedded Linux operating system, mobile agent middleware, and open source numerical libraries. Information sharing and interaction is achieved by mobile agent to distribute the analysis algorithms to cloud sensing and computing node to locally process data and share analysis results. Comparing to the commonly used client--server paradigm, the mobile agent approach enhances the system flexibility and adaptability, reduces raw data transmission, and instantaneously responds to dynamic changes of operations and tasks. Finally, the presented cloud-based paradigm of predictive maintenance is validated on a motor tested system.",

A tree structure is constructed to reduce errors and provide long range queries. Haar Wavelet transformation method is applied to convert histogram into a complete binary tree.

abstract="We investigate the claims of behavioral paternalism in the more realistic framework of complex choice. In particular, we analyze the claims made by behavioral paternalists that predictive analytics over large amounts of data will make it possible to target and successfully implement purportedly welfare-enhancing nudges deemed to make nudged agents better off ``as judged by themselves'' (AJBT). We draw parallels between the socialist calculation debate and nudge theoretical arguments, particularly the libertarian socialism of H. D. Dickinson and the libertarian paternalism of Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler. We find that if actual idealized behavior is a more complicated process of recursive feedback using a knowledge classification method, behavioral paternalists engaging in an automatized process of notice-and-comment rulemaking using Big Data methods still encounter epistemological problems and the problems associated with radical uncertainty unearthed during the socialist calculation debate and afterwards.",

abstract="On October 13, 2015, new laws came into force in Australia requiring telecommunications service providers to retain and store their `metadata' for 2 years so that it remains available for analysis by anti-terrorism strategists and organised crime fighters. But there are ongoing issues associated with this legislative approach, including the threats to privacy thereby, and concerns that the retention system can be circumvented entirely. This paper will outline the legal and criminological questions that need to be explored in order to help policymakers work through these issues so that an appropriate balance can be struck between forestalling crime and terrorism using all available electronic means, and not unduly curtailing the legitimate rights to privacy that citizens in modern democracies currently expect to enjoy.",

abstract="Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is a rapidly growing category of solid waste. China is now facing WEEE problems from both growing domestic generation and illegal imports. Currently, the amount of WEEE formally treated has increased steadily in China. The layout of the formal sector has been basically completed. Meanwhile, by controlling illegal disassembly activities, the informal sector has been gradually transformed to formal one. Beginning with the overview of the WEEE recycling industry in China, this paper first lists the latest progress in WEEE management from such aspects as the new edition of China RoHS Directive (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive), the updated WEEE Treatment List, the updated WEEE fund standard, the revised National Hazardous Waste List, and a brand-new plan on extended producer responsibility. In so doing, we elucidate the current challenges on WEEE management in detail: the imbalance between fund levies and subsidies, the gap in the supervision scope, the homogenization of recycling industry and the lack of life cycle approaches. Finally, a conceptual framework for integrated management of WEEE is proposed from a life cycle perspective. Overall, the life cycle management of WEEE includes three aspects: developing life cycle information for decision-making, implementing life cycle engineering with life cycle tools, and improving WEEE legislation based on life cycle thinking. By providing specific operating strategies, this life cycle framework should help to optimize WEEE management in developing countries where legislation is imperfect and the recycling system is relatively immature.",

abstract="There is a global trend of the shortage of nature resources, such as water and wildlife, which have suffered dramatic losses due to over-use, pollution, habitat loss, and, increasingly, changes caused by global warming. To make the planet more sustainable, abundant data has to be collected and analyzed from ecosystems for scientific decision-making, restoring and preserving natural resources. In this paper, an integrated systems approach has been proposed for the data acquisition and analysis in information management of an ecosystem; it is a direct extension of an agriculture ecosystem enterprise information system (AEEIS) developed by Xu et al. (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 3:5--17, 2008). The challenges in system development have been discussed, and the significance of the developed system has been illustrated through a thorough discussion and a case study on the genetic coding and expression of antelopes. In the case study, an IoT-based enterprise information system (EIS) has been applied to investigate the effects of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on the adaptation mechanism to high altitude hypoxia. Two remarkable conclusions are (i) the levels of the STAT3 mRNA and protein vary from one tissue to another, and the highest level is in the lung tissue, and (ii) Tibetan antelope's expression of STAT3 mRNA and protein are higher than that from plain sheep. Based on the fact that a Tibetan antelope has a higher adaptability to hypoxia; it has illustrated that the hypoxic STAT3-specific expression is one of the molecular bases of high altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan antelope.",

They neither drove nor walked around with GPS devices; they paid their highway tolls in cash; they seldom bought on credit; and no cameras marked their strolls in the park or their walks down the street. Times have changed. We begin with a brief discussion of the concept of anonymity. We then argue that public anonymity helps promote privacy in public. Next, we argue that public anonymity is worth protecting insofar as it promotes autonomy. After that we attempt to show how digital technology threatens public anonymity in the context of CCTV and GPS devices. We argue for a significant scaling back of public surveillance. We close with some thoughts on what we take to be the gratuitous costs imposed on those who would attempt to preserve their anonymity in public.",

abstract="Today, personal information has never been this prone to risk given the current advancement in technologies especially on personal devices. These devices are able to provide services to individuals; however, they also collect huge amount of personal information which may be used to infer sensitive private information. Among these personal devices, fitness trackers have the potential to capture the most personal user information. We conducted an analysis on fitness trackers and built a case study based on Fitbit wearables, its Android application, and the third party applications that provide further services by accessing Fitbit data and exchanging data with its application, given the user's permission. Specifically, we analyzed the case of Lose It! third party application. Then, we applied a framework for user privacy protection in the IoT, which we have defined in our previous work, to this specific case and validated our design choices using controlled experiments. The contribution of the paper is twofold: showing the risks for privacy due to the possible correlation of shared data to infer undisclosed personal information and presenting an approach to support users in managing privacy configuration settings. The ultimate aim of this study is to outline new challenges for IoT development by (i) emphasizing the need to protect users against inference attacks coming from the supposedly trusted third parties and (ii) making the process of information sharing more informative and the users more aware of the related risks.",

However, unlike the previous generations, it will also be highly integrative and backward compatible: combining the novel 5G air interface and spectrum together with legacy wireless systems like LTE/LTE-A and WiFi, in order to facilitate an umbrella of high-rate coverage and a seamless user experience. In order to support this advances in the radio interface, the core network will also have to reach unprecedented levels of elasticity and intelligence. Spectrum regulation will need to be rethought and significantly improved, whereas energy and cost efficiencies will become one of the key parameters that will steer the 5G design and development. This paper elaborates on the 5G related topics, identifying the key challenges for future research and preliminary 5G standardization activities, as well as providing a comprehensive survey of the current literature.",

abstract="Software designers are facing huge challenges imposed by a new generation of applications that mix real and digital worlds, such as pervasive games. This type of game has recently become a worldwide phenomenon, with thousands of people walking in the streets with smartphones to interact with the physical environment. In this paper, we propose a new method to assess pervasive qualities in pervasive mobile games, which can be customized and extended to other ubiquitous applications. This method generates a quality report, which consists of a quality spreadsheet (containing metric values and comments) and a quality vector (representing the game quality profile in the form of a bar chart). In addition, we can compare quality vectors using similarity criteria. In this paper, we apply the proposed method to commercial and academic prototype games to shed more light on their pervasive characteristics and identify ways to improve the overall quality that sets these games apart from traditional digital games---that is, pervasiveness.",

This paper reviews the current literature in these areas and identifies critical research and development challenges from the perspective---and for the benefit---of key stakeholders, considering their primary decision goals and context. From this vantage point, the critical evaluation framework is extended to include a classification of disruptions and extreme events and an overview of infrastructure modeling approaches and broader socioeconomic impacts assessment methods. Mapping the range of modeling and assessment methods against different decision contexts, critical gaps in knowledge and tools are identified to support the latter. Deep uncertainties characterize the challenge as each major component in the information and decision-making chain---from the frequency and intensity of a disruptive event, to assessing the first-order and immediate impacts of an infrastructure failure, to estimating the nature, extent and impact of cascading failures---multiplies the uncertainties. The emerging research challenges to deal with these interdependencies and uncertainties are discussed.",

pages="733--744",
abstract="We study the potential of cognition and cooperation in Body Area Networks (BANs). On one hand, most BAN-based applications involve end-to-end transmission across heterogenous networks. Cognitive communication has been known to be an effective technology for addressing network heterogeneity. On the other hand, a BAN is normally required to provide reliable communications and operate in a very low power level to conserve energy and reduce the electromagnetic radiation impact on human body. Cooperative communication has been known to enhance the transmission reliability and maintain low transmission power. However, the joint cognitive and cooperative mechanism has not been investigated yet in the literature. In this paper, we propose a network architecture for cognitive and cooperative communications in BANs. An intelligent mobile device is introduced as either a cognitive gateway to interconnect heterogenous networks; or a cooperative relay node to achieve transmission diversity. Two cooperative transmission schemes, Energy-conserved Cooperative Transmission and Reliability-driven Cooperative Transmission, are presented for different applications that have distinct energy consumption or reliability requirement. Optimization problems are formulated to optimally allocate power in the cooperative transmission. Results indicate that cooperative transmission schemes can significantly decrease Bit Error Rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption, compared to the non-cooperative schemes. The BER gain is over one order in the high SNR region, while the energy consumption can save up to 50{\%} in the low BER region.",

Prior research suggests that the decision to crowdsource cannot simply be based on perceived advantages; rather multiple factors should be considered. However, a structured account and integration of the most important decision factors is still lacking. This research fills the gap by providing a systematic literature review of the decision to crowdsource. Our results identify nine factors and sixteen sub-factors influencing this decision. These factors are structured into a decision framework concerning task, people, management, and environmental factors. Based on this framework, we give several recommendations for managers making the crowdsourcing decision.",

abstract="This study investigated the core motivations for adopting smart home services and explored the approaches and processes through which the motivations were incorporated with the original technology acceptance model (TAM) and the acceptance of the services. To achieve this purpose, an Internet survey was conducted in South Korea. The data (N = 799) from the survey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis. The results suggested that the perceived compatibility, connectedness, control, system reliability, and enjoyment of smart home services were positively related to the users' intention to use the services, whereas there was a negative association between the perceived cost and usage intention. The structural results also provided evidence of the validity of the original TAM. Although smart home services have attracted users' interest in the housing context, only a few studies have examined how the users' intention to use the services is motivated. The present study represents an initial step to explore the process of adopting smart home services with potential future research areas.",

abstract="Computational technologies have become increasingly pervasive in recent decades. Computing research in academia has commensurately seen dramatic increases, both in computing-specific research and research using computing. This article maps out the academic computing landscape by examining the connections between computing-related keywords used to describe theses and dissertations. Specifically, data from 29,435 dissertations and theses found in the ProQuest Theses and Dissertation database in the years 2009--2014 were analyzed. Results identify interdisciplinary clusters, as well as identify key differences in connections between the four computing disciplines in the database: computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), information technology (IT), and information science (ISci). For example, authors who primarily identify with CS rarely list secondary keywords, while authors from a high variety of other disciplines list CS as a secondary keyword. CE is tightly focused and growing, but rarely seen as a relevant secondary keyword by other fields. Meanwhile, the highly interdisciplinary nature of IT and ISci is shown, along with different subgroups within those areas. While the total number of unique theses with computing-related keywords has remained steady, they have shifted dramatically between specific computing fields (e.g., away from CS toward CE and IT). Visualizations present information on the growth and change in focus of computing-related theses and dissertations, as well as networks of keywords that co-occur. We discuss potential explanations of the patterns, as well as their implications on the future of graduate work in computing disciplines.",

abstract="The latest achievements in sensor technologies for blood glucose level monitoring, pump miniaturization for insulin delivery, and the availability of portable computing devices are paving the way toward the artificial pancreas as a treatment for diabetes patients. This device encompasses a controller unit that oversees the administration of insulin micro-boluses and continuously drives the pump based on blood glucose readings acquired in real time. In order to foster the research on the artificial pancreas and prepare for its adoption as a therapy, the European Union in 2010 funded the AP@home project, following a series of efforts already ongoing in the USA. This paper, authored by members of the AP@home consortium, reports on the technical issues concerning the design and implementation of an architecture supporting the exploitation of an artificial pancreas platform. First a PC-based platform was developed by the authors to prove the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithms responsible for insulin administration. A mobile-based one was then adopted to improve the comfort for the patients. Both platforms were tested on real patients, and a description of the goals, the achievements, and the major shortcomings that emerged during those trials is also reported in the paper.",

abstract="New healthcare technologies are emerging with the increasing age of the society, where the development of smart homes for monitoring the elders' activities is in the center of them. Identifying the resident's activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12{\%} improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition, which used dynamic segmentation. The f-measure metric demonstrated up to 12.73{\%} improvement.",

abstract="Funded research has been linked to academic production and performance. While the presence of funding acknowledgements may serve as an indicator of quality to some extent, we still lack tools to evaluate whether funding agencies allocate resources to novel and innovative research rather than mature fields. We address this issue in the present study by using bibliometrics. In particular, we exploit the citation network properties of academic articles to classify specific research fields into four categories: change maker, breakthrough, incremental, and matured. We then use funding acknowledgement information to identify the sponsors involved in each research type to characterize funding agencies. We focus our analysis on the robotics field in order to reveal international trends of financial acknowledgements. We find that the incremental and matured research areas show the highest counts of funding acknowledgements. Moreover, although research funded by some agencies is mostly recognized as incremental-type research, those in other categories may perform better in terms of the number of citations. Additionally, we analyze the interest of selected funding agencies in granular subject categories. The characterization of funding agencies in this study may help policymakers and funding organizations assess or adjust their strategies, benchmark with other key players, and obtain an overview of local and global acknowledgement trends.",

abstract="Nowadays, human activity recognition (HAR) is an important component of many ambient intelligent solutions where accelerometer and gyroscope signals give the information about the physical activity of an observed person. It has gained increasing attention by the availability of commercial wearable devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. Previous studies have shown that HAR can be seen as a general machine learning problem with a particular data pre-processing stage. In the last decade, several researchers measured high recognition rates on public data sets with numerous ``shallow'' machine learning techniques. In some cases artificial neural networks (ANNs) produced better performance than other shallow techniques while in other cases it was less effective. After the appearance of deep learning, a significant part of HAR researches turned toward more complex solutions such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and they claimed that CNNs can substitute the feature extraction stage in shallow techniques and can outperform them. Therefore in the current state of the art, the efficiency of ANNs against CNNs and other machine learning techniques is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of more ANN structures with different hyper-parameters and inputs on two public databases. The result will show that the two key factors in ANN design are the data-preprocessing and the hyper-parameter setup because the accuracy difference between a well and a badly parameterized ANN is huge. A well-tuned ANN with extracted features can outperform other machine learning methods in the HAR problem including CNN classifiers.",

abstract="South Korea has recently been suffering from damage caused by typhoons and floods. To reduce repetitive damage, the government has drawn up a trace of flood damage through surveys. However, due to the number of hours of time, cost and manpower, only major areas are being made. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create 3D simulation that is relatively easy to make and identify areas of flood risk using open government data. The study area is the Taehwa river basin in Ulsan, which was influenced by typhoon `Chaba' in last year. The stages of River level were set up by examining the actual rainfall and the river level. River basin were simulated in 3D at each river level using 1/1000 digital map. The result of this study can be used as references for disaster prevention planning and impact assessment of pre-disaster at the national level and for maintenance of facilities and the selection of shelters against typhoons and floods at the local government level.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks consist of embedded devices (sensor nodes), equipped with a low-power radio. They are used for many applications: from wireless building automation to e-health applications. However, due to the limited capabilities of sensor nodes, designing network protocols for these constrained devices is currently very challenging. Therefore, this paper presents the IDRA platform: an information driven architecture designed to support next-generation applications on resource constrained networked objects. IDRA supports simple but useful optimizations at an architectural level. These include support for cross-protocol interactions, energy efficiency optimizations, QoS optimizations (packet priorities, dynamic protocol selection), mobility support and heterogeneous network support. The paper shows how the development of protocols is improved by using an architecture which delegates specific tasks to a central system, decreasing the memory requirements of associated network protocols. A thorough experimental performance analysis demonstrates that IDRA is much more scalable in terms of memory requirements, energy requirements and processing overhead than traditional system architectures. Finally, the paper discusses how the optimizations presented in this paper can be used for the clean-slate design of architectures for other wireless or wired network types.",

abstract="This work characterized the research community of supply chain analytics (SCA) with respect to coauthorship, a special kind of collaboration. A characterization of coauthorship in terms of researchers' countries, institutions and individuals was elaborated, so three different one-mode networks were studied. Besides, the SCA research community is characterized in terms of Supply Chain Management (SCM) research streams. Coauthorship among researchers working on different streams is also analyzed. Metrics that depict the importance of the network nodes were studied such as degree, betweenness and closeness. This study found out an intense collaboration between USA and countries such as China, India, United Kingdom and Canada. Researchers from Canada and Ireland are better situated (central) in the network, although they have not published a considerable amount of papers. The presence of cliques and the small-world effect were also observed in these networks. In terms of research streams, more research on SCA located at the Strategic Management, Technology-focused and Logistics streams was found. The most common links between research streams are on the one side, Technology-focused with both Strategic Management and Logistics and on the other side Strategic Management with both Logistics and Organizational behavior. SCA researchers are rarely working with a focus on Marketing. This study contributes to the SCA literature by identifying the most central actors in this area and by characterizing the area in terms of SCM research streams. This study may contribute to the development of more focused research incentive programs and collaborations.",

A bottom-up approach based on localised emission factors and actual on-road driving condition has been adopted to develop the system. As a case study of application and evaluation, an emission reduction effect analysis of the supposed low-emission zone (LEZ) policy in Beijing (2012) was conducted. According to the simulated results in the forms of tables, histograms and grid maps, the establishment of this LEZ had a definite effect on the emission reduction of various types of air pollutants, especially carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon. In the system, the simulation methodology for identifying environmental benefits brought by the LEZ policy could be used to assess other similar environmental policies. Through flexible modification of configuration values or input data variables, the efficacy of separate or joint policies could be quantifiably evaluated and graphically displayed.",

There are many clustering algorithms but k-mean algorithm is most popular and widely used in many fields such as image processing, machine learning, pattern reorganization etc.; but it has a major drawback that is; its output is really sensitive to the random selection of initial centroids or its final output is totally depends on initial selection of centroids. Because of this drawback many techniques were introduced for K-mean algorithm. This paper introduces an initial centroid selection method for K-mean algorithm by using Atkinson Index. Atkinson index is a technique for measuring the inequality here. It is used for initial seed selection; experimental result shows that the proposed technique, which we applying on liver patient data set gives more accurate result than the original K-mean algorithm.",

These devices have the ability to change their resistance state in a reversible and controlled way applying an external voltage.

Many physical models have been developed with the aim of understanding the mechanisms that control the resistive switching.

abstract="Due to its origins in the literature on judgment and decision-making, context effects in marketing are construed exclusively in terms of how choices deviate from utility maximization principles as a function of how choices are presented (e.g., framing, sequence, composition). This limits our understanding of a range of other relevant context effects on choice. This paper broadens the scope of context effects to include social (e.g., with friends or family) and situational factors (e.g., location (home/store), time, weather).We define contexts as any factor that has the potential to shift the choice outcomes by altering the process by which the decision is made. We use this lens to integrate the psychology literature on habitual choice, System I and II decision-making, and a recent stream of empirical work that involves social and situational effects into the scope of context effects. We distinguish between exogenous and endogenous context effects, based on whether the decision-maker chooses the context.

We conclude with a discussion of trends and opportunities for new research on context effects.",

abstract="Two-way communication has been identified as the smart grid flagship feature that enables the smart grid to attain its outcomes over the legacy power grid. Integrating communication networks into the power grid will motivate malicious attackers to target information exchange. Therefore, achieving secure and authentic communication in the smart grid networks is an indispensable requirement. In this paper, we propose a sophisticated hybrid encryption scheme that incorporates public and symmetric key encryptions to secure smart metering network. Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and Advanced Encryption Scheme (AES) are chosen as the building blocks for the proposed scheme. In order to optimize the computation overhead of ECIES, a precomputation procedure is presented to provide faster encryption/decryption. The proposed technique provides data integrity, confidentiality and authenticity as well as it resists against false data injection and message reply attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed approach surpasses some of the existing schemes in terms of computation, communication and storage overhead.",

day="24",
abstract="In this paper an agent-based simulation is developed in order to evaluate an Ambient Intelligence scenario based on agents. Many AmI applications are implemented through agents but they are not compared with any other existing alternative in order to evaluate the relative benefits of using them. The proposed simulation environment analyses such benefits using two evaluation criteria: First, measuring agent satisfaction of different types of desires along the execution. Second, measuring time savings obtained through a correct use of context information. In this paper an existing agent architecture, an ontology and a 12-steps protocol to provide AmI services in airports, is evaluated using the NetLogo simulation environment. In our NetLogo model we are considering scalability issues of this application domain but using FIPA and BDI extensions to be coherent with our previous works and our previous JADE implementation of them. The NetLogo model simulates an airport with agent `passengers' passing through several zones located in a specific order in a map: passport controls, check-in counters of airline companies, boarding gates, different types of shopping. Although the initial data in each simulation is generated randomly, and the model is just an approximation of real-world airports, the definition of this case of use of AmI through NetLogo agents opens an interesting way to evaluate the benefits of using AmI, which is a significant contribution to the final development of AmI systems.",

abstract="In the provision of on-demand personalized services in an IoT-based hyper-connected network, it is inevitable for the mobile device that centrally controls personal information to become the focal point. In this IoT environment, because mobile devices serve as a gateway for all personalized services, their protection plays a crucial role in the creation of a secure IoT environment. In the case of Android, the classic mobile platform, security is at risk from repackaging attacks because of structural weaknesses in the platform. To prevent such repackaging attacks, Android-based applications currently utilize various obfuscation techniques and insert tamper detection methods. However, it is possible to easily bypass even these measures. Thus, in this paper we propose an anti-reverse-engineering dynamic tamper detection scheme that applies image steganography to distribute and hide code in PNG image files. We design and implement this proposed scheme, and present the results of a security evaluation of an application with the scheme applied.",

abstract="Multi-material 3D printing with electrically functional materials including conducting, sensing, insulating and semiconducting materials has led to the development of smart devices such as 3D structural electronics, sensors, batteries, etc. Electronically smart devices are a hot issue in 3D printing because they can certainly benefit from 3D printing technology, providing high design flexibility and customized functions. Shape-changing materials (e.g. shape memory polymers) incorporated in 3D printing have given birth to 4D printing, where 3D printed structures change in their shapes by external stimuli (temperature, light, water, etc.). The motivation of this review paper is to discuss mutual benefits from both 3D printed smart devices and 4D printed features, which can be built in a single body. It is expected that the combination of 3D printed smart devices and 4D printing would contribute to the development of high performance, adaptability to the environment and programmable 3D smart devices, which have not yet existed. This paper has reviewed the background of 3D printing, smart device fabrication using 3D printing, development into 4D printing, and future applications of 4D printing.",

Our increasing dependence on ubiquitous computing creates an urgent need for modelling and verification technologies to support the design process, and hence improve the reliability and reduce production costs.

abstract="Smartphones and mobile applications are omnipresent in our lives. At the core of this article are `other-tracking apps', i.e. mobile applications that make it possible, via location technology, to track others. These apps ensure that we are never unconnected from the network of ubiquitous information and, via that network, from others. In specific, focus lies on apps designed for parents to remotely track the whereabouts of their child(ren). This particular case can be considered as one example of broader reflection on what continuous technical connectivity means in moral terms. Other-tracking apps give new ground to moral queries related to information technologies. Even though there is little doubt that parents might implement these technologies with good intention to extend care and responsibility over a distance, our concern is that they mistake control for care. This article seeks to demonstrate that a critical stance towards other-tracking by parents is required, because these apps raise a number of concerns that should be recognized as they are implemented. A number of moral critiques are expressed and discussed. These apps have the potential to engender a situation of `over-proximity'. A framework is hence required that emphasizes maintaining the critical distance to respect the other's heterogeneity, autonomy, and privacy.",

abstract="Process improvement is the most value-adding activity in the business process management (BPM) lifecycle. Despite mature knowledge, many approaches have been criticized to lack guidance on how to put process improvement into practice. Given the variety of emerging digital technologies, organizations not only face a process improvement black box, but also high uncertainty regarding digital technologies. This paper thus proposes a method that supports organizations in exploiting the digitalization potential of their business processes. To achieve this, action design research and situational method engineering were adopted. Two design cycles involving practitioners (i.e., managers and BPM experts) and end-users (i.e., process owners and participants) were conducted. In the first cycle, the method's alpha version was evaluated by interviewing practitioners from five organizations. In the second cycle, the beta version was evaluated via real-world case studies. In this paper, detailed results of one case study, which was conducted at a semiconductor manufacturer, are included.",

abstract="This paper proposes a Subjective Logic based composite privacy leakage metric that both takes into account the amount of information leakage and also that information with high entropy in some cases may be considered encrypted. It is furthermore shown both analytically and experimentally that Min-entropy is considered better than Shannon, R{\'e}nyi or Max entropy for identifying encrypted content for the composite metric. This is in particular useful for implementing privacy-enhanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), where sampled encrypted traffic can be considered to have low risk of revealing sensitive information. The combined metric can be used in a Policy Enforcement Point that acts as a proxy/anonymiser in order to to reduce the leakage of private or sensitive information from the IDS sensors to an outsourced Managed Security Service provider. Although the composite privacy indicator is IDS specific, the authorisation architecture is general, and may also be useful for anonymising or pseusonymising sensitive information from or to other types of sensors that need to be exposed to the Internet. The solution is based on the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language policy language extended with support for Subjective Logic, in order to provide a method for expressing fine-grained access control policies that are based on uncertain evidences.",

abstract="The materials and manufacturing processes are evolving very rapidly subject to today's high performance, shorter lead times, and high part complexity needs. With over 80,000 materials, various manufacturing technologies (additive and traditional), diverse streams of application (aerospace, motor vehicles, health care, etc.), and high cost incurred due to manufacturability of the part, it has become essential to choose the right compromise of technology resource in early stages of design considering the Design for Manufacturing (DFM)/Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) guidelines. The concerned literature to date focuses on manufacturing technology selection by being either part specific or application specific. As multiple criteria are involved for decision making, this paper provides a thorough review on the following questions: (1) What are the common design criteria used in literature for additive and traditional manufacturing technologies with respect to product-process integration? (2) What is the literature contribution for material and manufacturing process selection strategies with special focus on comparison of additive and traditional manufacturing technologies? The paper attempts to provide as a result a basic generic methodology for resource selection (RS) which will not only take into account all of the areas of application, DFM/DFAM guidelines, and three design criteria (function, cost, and environment), but will also discuss avenues for collaborative product development. A complex industrial case study is also presented to test the proposed methodology.",

The focus is on how ubiquitous technologies have been and can be utilised in developing urban infrastructure, including town planning, street and property maintenance, water supply, public transportation and environmental protection. Such an emerging infrastructure is expected to provide everyone with an opportunity to access urban infrastructure and services with the help of ubiquitous technologies. However, in order to become reality, this requires some kind of democratisation of technology, which is a neglected topic in u-city discourse. It is also important to analyse u-city developments from the point of view of production of space with special reference to the potential colonisation of everyday life. Theoretically speaking, one answer to such compelling questions about the rationale of u-city development can be sought from the idea of the `right to the city', a slogan originally coined by Henri Lefebvre. This approach highlights the importance of involving people to envisioning the future of urban form starting from the perspective of their everyday life. Such a dimension should be given more prominent role in current u-city developments.",

In an attempt to explain why viewpoints lead to richer domain understanding, we examine in a posteriori way the role that traceability plays in building individual and team-wide requirements models. Our post hoc analysis results suggest that better traceability from the sources makes team-level requirements modeling more focused, whereas the lack of traceability makes it less fruitful. Our work not only shifts the case study from an exploratory to an explanatory nature, but also proposes the integration of conflict-centric views into viewpoint merging to further improve the understanding about stakeholder requirements' trade-offs.",

abstract="In recent years, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers have played a crucial role in providing data fusion and high accuracy classification solutions for various, complex, non-linear problems. Their popularity accompanied by the ever-increasing need of implementing it on computationally weak, portable or even wearable systems has refueled the effort to accelerate their execution. In this paper, we explore FPGA-based acceleration to produce efficient SVM hardware co-processors. We propose a systematic two-level approach for SVM acceleration, which first optimizes the global structure of the original SVM's behavioral description to exploit the data- and instruction-level parallelism and then further refines it through a targeted design exploration that matches the accelerator's memory architecture to its computation and memory access patterns. The proposed methodology has been implemented as a framework on top of Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. We evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology through a rich set of analysis and validation results, which show that its adoption delivers SVM accelerator designs achieving latency gains of up to 98.78 {\%} in respect to Vivado-HLS default optimized solution. Finally, using as a case study an ECG analysis and Arrhythmia detection system we show that a target Zynq programmable SoC utilizing the optimized SVM accelerator design outperforms pure software implementations in numerous single or dual core target platforms, achieving speedups, which range from 10 {\texttimes} up to 78 {\texttimes}.",

One of the main factors that help achieve this success is reputation systems that enable OSN users to mutually establish trust relationships based on their past experience. Current approaches for the reputation management cannot achieve the fine granularity and verifiability for each individual user, in the sense that the reputation values on such OSNs are coarse and lack of credibility. In this paper, we propose a fine granularity attribute-based reputation system which enables users to rate each other's attributes instead of identities. Our scheme first verifies each OSN user's attributes, and further allows OSN users to vote on the posted attribute-associated messages to derive the reputation value. The attribute verification process provides the authenticity of the reputation value without revealing the actual value to entities who do not have the vote privilege. To predict a stranger's behavior, we propose a reputation retrieval protocol for querying the reputation value on a specific attribute. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to define a fine-grained reputation value based on users' verified attributes in OSNs with privacy preservation. We provide the security analysis along with the simulation results to verify the privacy preservation and feasibility. The implementation of the proposed scheme on current OSNs is also discussed.",

abstract="Over the past decades, various methods have been developed to analysis and monitor the dynamic metal processes, specially the extensively used cold rolling process. However, some limitation still exists for the traditional data analysis tools to be implemented well for these processes. For example, the performance of many of the traditional data analysis approaches cannot be guaranteed when the distribution assumption is violated. Meanwhile, it is still lack of systematic method to make good use of the huge condition parameters. In this article we develop a viable on-line anomaly incipient detection technique towards the cold rolling process of steel sheets. Based on the condition-based SPC, the proposed approach can monitor the multi condition parameters as well as the corresponding output characteristic in a real-time manner simultaneously and efficiently. It provides a framework for statistical process monitoring development under such dynamic manufacturing environment in order to improve the detecting Sensitivity and Specificity. The real data practical application verifies that this proposed approach can have an excellent performance without the normal distribution assumption, thus it has great potential to be employed in a large application area.",

The overall goal of disassembly is to maximize the retrieval of various metals and plastics contained in WEEE in order to reduce their negative effects on human health and environmental sustainability and to increase economic gains. This study aims to evaluate alternative layout configurations for WEEE disassembly systems (WDS). In this context, various configurations were compared in terms of pre-defined performance criteria, such as the total number of disassembled WEEE and the total revenue from sales, using simulation models. The results of this study show that the performance of a WDS was significantly affected by output transfer systems along with the specialization of operators on certain types of WEEE.",

A compromised sensor node can be used to send fake sensing reports to the sink. If undetected these reports can raise false alarms. To deal with the problem of fake report generation, a number of en-route filtering schemes have been proposed. Each of these schemes uses different cryptographic methods to check the authenticity of reports while they are being forwarded hop by hop toward base station. However, majority of these techniques can handle only limited compromised nodes or they either need node localization or statically configured routes for sending reports. Furthermore, majority of en-route filtering techniques are vulnerable to various denial of service attacks. Our main aims in this survey are: (a) to describe the major en-route filtering techniques, (b) to analyze these techniques on various parameters including security and (c) to outline main unresolved research challenges in en-route filtering in WSNs.",

abstract="This article presents a comparative review of systems performing service composition in Ambient Intelligence Environments. Such environments should comply to ubiquitous or pervasive computing guidelines by sensing the user needs or wishes and offering intuitive human-computer interaction and a comfortable non-intrusive experience. To achieve this goal service orientation is widely used and tightly linked with AmI systems. Some of these employ the Web Service technology, which involves well-defined web technologies and standards that facilitate interoperable machine to machine interaction. Other systems regard services of different technologies (e.g. UPnP, OSGi etc) or generally as abstractions of various actions. Service operations are sometimes implemented as software based functions or actions over hardware equipment (e.g. UPnP players). However, a single service satisfies an atomic only user need, so services need to be composed (i.e. combined), in order to provide the usually requested complex tasks. Since manual service composition is obviously a hassle for the user, ambient systems struggle to automate this process by applying various methods. The approaches that have been adopted during the last years vary widely in many aspects, like domain of application, modeling of services, composition method, knowledge representation and interfaces. This work presents a comparative view of these approaches revealing similarities and differences, while providing additional information.",

abstract="Some of the recent attempts for improving and transforming engineering education are reviewed. The attempts aim at providing the entry level engineers with the skills needed to address the challenges of future large-scale complex systems and projects. Some of the frontier sectors and future challenges for engineers are outlined. The major characteristics of the coming intelligence convergence era (the post-information age) are identified. These include the prevalence of smart devices and environments, the widespread applications of anticipatory computing and predictive / prescriptive analytics, as well as a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. Devices and machines will be able to learn from, and with, humans in a natural collaborative way. The recent game changers in learnscapes (learning paradigms, technologies, platforms, spaces, and environments) that can significantly impact engineering education in the coming era are identified. Among these are open educational resources, knowledge-rich classrooms, immersive interactive 3D learning, augmented reality, reverse instruction / flipped classroom, gamification, robots in the classroom, and adaptive personalized learning. Significant transformative changes in, and mass customization of, learning are envisioned to emerge from the synergistic combination of the game changers and other technologies. The realization of the aforementioned vision requires the development of a new multidisciplinary framework of emergent engineering for relating innovation, complexity and cybernetics, within the future learning environments. The framework can be used to treat engineering education as a complex adaptive system, with dynamically interacting and communicating components (instructors, individual, small, and large groups of learners). The emergent behavior resulting from the interactions can produce progressively better, and continuously improving, learning environment. As a first step towards the realization of the vision, intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystems need to be developed to facilitate collaboration between the various stakeholders of engineering education, and to accelerate the development of a skilled engineering workforce. The major components of the ecosystems include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities, blended learning and research spaces, novel ultra-intelligent software agents, multimodal and autonomous interfaces, and networked cognitive and tele-presence robots.",

abstract="The food intelligent packaging (IP) technologies are reviewed with a particular emphasis on the possibilities of radiofrequency identification (RFID) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) technologies for developing the food IP concept. Passive RFID and SAW technologies are the more promising ones to achieve a food IP that can wirelessly communicate the food quality to the different agents of the food chain. However, some drawbacks and cost of these technologies are limiting their massive use in food IP. This is the reason why a lot of research works are being currently performed that focus on increasing functionality (e.g., enabling the tag antenna as a sensing device) and reducing costs of components and materials of these RFID and SAW systems. Furthermore, benefits can be also achieved by means of integrating the RFID, SAW, and other sensing technologies. The RFID and SAW technologies can be embedded in a wireless sensor network (WSN), and the corresponding tags and readers can build more intelligent networks by sharing the sensing, logic, and transmission capabilities of the sensor networks. The above two technologies can be integrated in two different ways: sensor-enabled tags---RFID or SAW (or RFID or SAW sensor tags)---and RFID and/or SAW-embedded WSN. The application of these technologies on secondary packages, as the paperboard packages, can dilute the costs of application on primary packaging and allow the massive use of these technologies in the food supply chain.",

abstract="Although hard factors such as availability, efficiency, safety, and comfort make up the core of the public transport quality of service, they are only a part of the bigger picture. This bigger picture is modified and shaped daily, where the increasing permeation of technology creates new possibilities for passengers to experience their journeys. Despite technology becoming ubiquitous in public transport, it has had only limited impact on how passengers connect affectively and symbolically with the service. This ``affective gap'' is at the core of what differentiates private and public transport. Being able to reduce this gap is therefore valuable to passengers and public transport service providers alike. In this paper, we build on existing and ongoing work to discuss the relevance of a passenger-centric approach to innovation in the field of public transport. This passenger-centric approach puts passengers at the centre of future solutions, where their evolving needs, desires, and values are used to guide how to enhance the existing core functionality of the service. To test our hypothesis that passenger-centric innovation is valuable to passengers and advantageous to service providers alike, we put forward a review on how innovation is being approached in both the aviation and car industries. This review is supported by our own insights, which have been based on data collected from urban rail commuters in Australia. We further support our argument by looking at particular examples of innovation in the field of public transport, and discussing the existing barriers and drivers that can, respectively, hinder or propel passenger-centric innovation.",

abstract="This paper presents a fuzzy expert system-based framework for flood management in Saudi Arabia that helps the civil defense (CD) authority in both preparing their flood management capabilities and responding to scalable levels of flood risk. One of the most important type of flood management capabilities is training capabilities, the adequacy of training capabilities of emergency responders is a critical factor that influences on flood risk management, even considering other types of capabilities such as equipment and infrastructure. However, due to the lack of adequate training capabilities in place to address dynamic change of flood risk and vulnerabilities in some areas, emergency readiness for floods has been critically affected and resulted in ineffective response and mutual aid. Here, the study aimed to aid decision-makers in the Saudi CD Authority to reduce inappropriate readiness of training capabilities in some critical zones and maintain the levels of readiness using a proposed fuzzy expert system-based framework, which is named the capability evaluation and readiness (CER) framework. The developed CER framework includes a new fuzzy expert system, which is named the intelligent capability evaluation and readiness (ICER) system. CER framework uses three key elements for readiness evaluation and addressing needs related to training capabilities; the records of the provided training and exercises; the targeted standard and policy of readiness and mutual aid; and risk assessment of each zone and existing hazard and vulnerability (HV) factors within a zone. The results of evaluation by interviews indicted high agreement on effectiveness and productivity of the CER framework, however, it is recommended that additional stakeholders are included in order to have comprehensive information regarding others HV factors. In addition, questionnaires shown that more than 60{\%} of the respondents believe that the ICER system is an effective tool for flood response, however, regarding the readiness of the training capabilities, more that 17{\%} of the respondents believe that the ICER system is not effective tool to improving the readiness of the training capabilities.",

Such systems may be understood as distributed and collaborative sensor networks, able to produce, aggregate and process images in order to understand the observed scene and communicate the relevant information found about it. In this paper, we investigate the peculiarities of visual sensor networks with respect to standard vision systems and we identify possible strategies to accomplish image processing and analysis tasks over them. Although the rather strong constraints in computational and transmission power of embedded platforms that may prevent the use of state of the art computer vision and pattern recognition methods, we argue that multi-node processing methods may be envisaged to decompose a complex task into a hierarchy of computationally simpler problems to be solved over the nodes of the network. These ideas are illustrated by describing an application of visual sensor network to infomobility. In particular, we consider an experimental setting in which several views of a parking lot are acquired by the sensor nodes in the network. By integrating the various views, the network is capable to provide a description of the scene in terms of the available spaces in the parking lot.",

This understanding is made all the more critical when there are politically sensitive differences in status between areas (such as those implied by labelling one a ``developing region''). This paper examines the politics of designing interfaces by looking at the situation of two producers in developing regions and relating this to the outcomes of studying a map metaphor with potential consumers from India and the UK. It does so in the context of exploring the representation of food production information as interactive user-generated content. Its findings challenge the popular notion of national cultural norms and suggest that an interface, which emphasises geography, can hide inter-continental similarities and intra-national variation and thus provide new support for stereotyping by region.",

Two dimensions are usually highlighted among the main features of smart urban development. The reliance on the intensive use of ICT to address the most challenging issues of urban planning is emphasised from a technological perspective. On the other hand, a more holistic scenario enhances citizens' inventiveness, collective intelligence and knowledge-based urban development. The impact of ICT on urban development and representation is particularly remarkable when an entire new city is built following a smart city approach. Three relevant examples would be Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD) City in South Korea, Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Skolkovo City in Russian Federation, built to challenge the status quo of urban dynamics.

The National Forest Continuous Inventory (NFCI) is the first level of China's three-tiered inventory system. The NFCI is administered by the State Forestry Administration; data are acquired by five inventory institutions around the country. Several important components of the database include land type, forest classification and ageclass/ age-group. The NFCI database in China is constructed based on 5-year inventory periods, resulting in some of the data not being timely when reports are issued. To address this problem, a forest growth simulation model has been developed to update the database for years between the periodic inventories. In order to aid in forest plan design and management, a three-dimensional virtual reality system of forest landscapes for selected units in the database (compartment or sub-compartment) has also been developed based on Virtual Reality Modeling Language. In addition, a transparent internet publishing system for a spatial database based on open source WebGIS (UMN Map Server) has been designed and utilized to enhance public understanding and encourage free participation of interested parties in the development, implementation, and planning of sustainable forest management.",

abstract="With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of smart devices should be available for sensing environment variables and reporting events periodically that may happen in certain regions, for supporting industrial applications. It is usual that contiguous queries on point-of-interests may have some region overlapping. In this setting, sensory data retrieved by recent queries may be beneficial for answering the queries forthcoming, when these data are fresh enough. To address this challenge, we propose a popularity-based caching strategy for optimizing periodic query processing. Specifically, the network region is divided using a cell-based manner, where each grid cell is abstracted as an elementary unit for the caching purpose. Fresh sensory data are cached in the memory of the sink node. The popularity of grid cells are calculated leveraging the queries conducted in recent time slots, which reflects the possibility that grid cells may be covered by the queries forthcoming. Prefetching may be performed for grid cells with a higher degree of popularity when missed in the cache. These cached sensory data are used for facilitating the query answering afterwards. The simulation results show that our approach can reduce the communication cost significantly and increase the network capability.",

abstract="With the advent of future generation mobile communication technologies (5G), there is the potential to allow mobile users to have access to big data processing over different clouds and networks. The increasing numbers of mobile users come with additional expectations for personalized services (e.g., social networking, smart home, health monitoring) at any time, from anywhere, and through any means of connectivity. Because of the expected massive amount of complex data generated by such services and networks from heterogeneous multiple sources, an infrastructure is required to recognize a user's sentiments (e.g., emotion) and behavioral patterns to provide a high quality mobile user experience. To this end, this paper proposes an infrastructure that combines the potential of emotion-aware big data and cloud technology towards 5G. With this proposed infrastructure, a bimodal system of big data emotion recognition is proposed, where the modalities consist of speech and face video. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves 83.10 {\%} emotion recognition accuracy using bimodal inputs. To show the suitability and validity of the proposed approach, Hadoop-based distributed processing is used to speed up the processing for heterogeneous mobile clients.",

abstract="The need for the analysis of energy consumption has become greater due to the constrained resources of mobile devices afforded by the increased usage of mobile devices and the environmental footprint of large-scale, distributed systems. Energy usage has previously been modelled for a variety of use cases in order to optimise its consumption, through both simulation and real-world use. As computing devices become ubiquitous, more mobile, and highly varied in their components and use; the networks which interconnect them have become highly dynamic in tandem. This is partly due to the mobility of devices and the constantly fluctuating resource requirements. Whilst simulation of energy consumption within networks has been conducted for specific use cases (e.g. Cloud and wireless networks), it is often not examined from a unified view. This paper attempts to review the state-of-the-art in network energy consumption, modelling, and simulation from the perspective of heterogeneous networks but with a focus upon mobile devices, and then propose a gap in which a unified view is needed. Such views will assist in understanding more about the complex relationships between varied, synergistic device types, such as those which compose mobile cloud networks.",

journal="Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing",
year="2017",
month="Oct",
day="30",
abstract="The aim of this study is to assess the impact of aging process in gait variability. Stride interval variability is estimated by using two approaches: (1) a non-linear fractal analysis (detrended fluctuation analysis) which evaluates the presence of long-range correlations in stride interval time series; and (2) a statistical dispersion measure (coefficient of variation) to quantify the magnitude of the stride interval fluctuations. Two groups of physically independent older adults, with different walking ability, have participated in the gait trials performed in an elderly care home. The estimated stride interval variability of the elders is compared to each other and to the variability coming from a young adult group used as control. To accomplish this, an infrastructure which uses wearables to acquire inertial data from the trunk of each participant is provided. Stride interval time series are made up of the estimated heel-strike events from previous inertial data. In addition, a service segments straight paths within the gait trials, discarding turns. The stride intervals from the segmented straight paths are stitched together to produce the long time series required to analyze gait variability. Despite the study has not provided conclusive results from an individual perspective, finding older adults who have less stride interval variability than younger ones. The inter-class analysis conducted has shown interesting findings about the relation between the subjective characterization of gait, aging and stride interval variability estimated through the two proposed approaches.",

abstract="Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a promising wireless network technology, in the context of body area network (BAN) applications, to provide the required quality of service support concerning the communication between sensor nodes placed on a user's body and a personal device, such as a smartphone. Most previous BLE performance studies in the literature have focused primarily in networks with a single slave (point-to-point link) or traffic scenarios with relatively low data rate. However, many BAN sensors generate high data rate traffic, and several sensor nodes (slaves) may be actively sending data in the same BAN. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of the suitability of BLE mainly under these conditions. Results show that, for the same traffic, the BLE protocol presents lower energy consumption and supports more sensor nodes than an alternative IEEE 802.15.4-based protocol. This study also identifies and characterizes some implementation constraints on the tested platforms that impose limits on the achievable performance.",

To fulfill the important mission of a technological assistance, a technique first had to identify the ongoing activities of its user by tracking everyday life objects in real time using, for example, passive RFID tags. To increase the quality of information extracted from the objects localization by properly using the received signal strength indicator, this paper explores Kalman filter, particle filter and few others filtering algorithm that enhances the tracking performance. It also discusses three of the most interesting methods that can be applied for the localization of objects in smart environments without requiring the installation of references tags everywhere. Finally, to increase the value, we include experiments that were conducted within a real smart home infrastructure to review the positive and negative elements of each method.",

abstract="Bibliometric and ``tech mining'' studies depend on a crucial foundation---the search strategy used to retrieve relevant research publication records. Database searches for emerging technologies can be problematic in many respects, for example the rapid evolution of terminology, the use of common phraseology, or the extent of ``legacy technology'' terminology. Searching on such legacy terms may or may not pick up R{\&}D pertaining to the emerging technology of interest. A challenge is to assess the relevance of legacy terminology in building an effective search model. Common-usage phraseology additionally confounds certain domains in which broader managerial, public interest, or other considerations are prominent. In contrast, searching for highly technical topics is relatively straightforward. In setting forth to analyze ``Big Data,'' we confront all three challenges---emerging terminology, common usage phrasing, and intersecting legacy technologies. In response, we have devised a systematic methodology to help identify research relating to Big Data. This methodology uses complementary search approaches, starting with a Boolean search model and subsequently employs contingency term sets to further refine the selection. The four search approaches considered are: (1) core lexical query, (2) expanded lexical query, (3) specialized journal search, and (4) cited reference analysis. Of special note here is the use of a ``Hit-Ratio'' that helps distinguish Big Data elements from less relevant legacy technology terms. We believe that such a systematic search development positions us to do meaningful analyses of Big Data research patterns, connections, and trajectories. Moreover, we suggest that such a systematic search approach can help formulate more replicable searches with high recall and satisfactory precision for other emerging technology studies.",

abstract="Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have become a weapon of choice for hackers, cyber extortionists, and cyber terrorists. These attacks can swiftly incapacitate a victim, causing huge revenue losses. Despite the large number of traditional mitigation solutions that exists today, DDoS attacks continue to grow in frequency, volume, and severity. This calls for a new network paradigm to address the requirements of today's challenging security threats. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which has gained significant traction by many researchers to address the requirement of today's data centers. Inspired by the capabilities of SDN, we present a comprehensive survey of existing SDN-based DDoS attack detection and mitigation solutions. We classify solutions based on DDoS attack detection techniques and identify requirements of an effective solution. Based on our findings, we propose a novel framework for detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks in a large-scale network which comprises a smart city built on SDN infrastructure. Our proposed framework is capable of meeting application-specific DDoS attack detection and mitigation requirements. The primary contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide an in-depth survey and discussion of SDN-based DDoS attack detection and mitigation mechanisms, and we classify them with respect to the detection techniques. Second, leveraging the characteristics of SDN for network security, we propose and present an SDN-based proactive DDoS Defense Framework (ProDefense). We show how this framework can be utilized to secure applications built for smart cities. Moreover, the paper highlights open research challenges, future research directions, and recommendations related to SDN-based DDoS detection and mitigation.",

The concept of totally integrated supply chains should be replaced by the idea of loosely coupled processes and planning systems run by companies who preserve their autonomy and use competition as an incentive system and a source of energy and flexibility. These companies should interconnect on a bilateral level in order to exchange information about updated demand forecasts and the availability of capacities. But they should not develop strongly integrated networks who start competing with other supply chains on the level of this new identity.",

Unfortunately, the wireless communication among vehicles is vulnerable to security threats that may lead to very serious safety hazards. In this work, we propose a viable solution for coping with Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Conventionally, Public Key Infrastructure is utilized for a secure communication with the pre-certified public key. However, a secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication requires additional means of verification in order to avoid impersonation attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes to certify both the public key and out-of-band sense-able static attributes to enable mutual authentication of the communicating vehicles. Vehicle owners are bound to preprocess (periodically) a certificate for both a public key and a list of fixed unchangeable attributes of the vehicle. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be adaptable with regards to the existing authentication protocols. We illustrate the security verification of the proposed protocol using a detailed proof in Spi calculus.",

abstract="New forms of artificial intelligence on the one hand and the ubiquitous networking of ``everything with everything'' on the other hand characterize the fourth industrial revolution. This results in a changed understanding of human--machine interaction, in new models for production, in which man and machine together with virtual agents form hybrid teams. The empirical study ``Socializing with robots'' aims to gain insight especially into conditions of development and processes of hybrid human--machine teams. In the experiment, human--robot actions and interactions were closely observed in a virtual environment. Robots as partners differed in shape and behavior (reliable or faulty). Participants were instructed to achieve an objective that could only be achieved via close teamwork. This paper unites different aspects from core disciplines of social robotics and psychology contributing to anthropomorphization with the empirical insights of the experiment. It focuses on the psychological effects (e.g. reactions of different personality types) on anthropomorphization and mechanization, taking the inter- and transdisciplinary field of social robotics as a starting point.",

abstract="With the development and wide adoption of industrial wireless sensor networks to support various domain applications, the boundary detection of continuous objects has become an important research challenge, where improving the accuracy of boundary area while reducing the energy consumption are the first-class citizens to be considered. To address this research challenge, this article proposes a two-stage boundary face detection mechanism, where sensor nodes are duty-cycled and to be deployed in a dense fashion. When the occurrence of potential events are recognized using the initially activated sensor nodes, the boundary faces of continuous objects are constructed through adopting planarization algorithms. Thereafter, sensor nodes contained in certain boundary faces are examined, where their sensory data are estimated using spatial interpolation methods. Certain sensor nodes are selected to be woken up, only when their sensory data suggest that they should be more appropriate candidates of boundary sensor nodes. Consequently, the size of boundary faces is reduced, and this coarse-to-fine refinement procedure iterates, until all sensor nodes contained in the boundary faces have been examined. Experimental evaluation result shows that the boundary area can be refined significantly and be more precise, where the half of the initial boundary face area should be reduced in most situations.",

Along with the growing need for advanced features in network management solutions, several distribution models were investigated, varying from centralized to fully distributed models. Despite the common agreement that some sort of distribution is really needed to execute management tasks, there seems to exist a permanent quest for the next distributed network management model. Among the distributed models, an interesting and emerging possibility is the use of P2P technology in network management, also known as P2P-Based Network Management (P2PBNM). Several investigations have shown that P2PBNM can be seen as an enabler for advanced network management features. However, due to the dispersion concerning the concepts and features related to these investigations, it is difficult to draw a comprehensive picture of the P2PBNM area. The purpose of this article is to look at literature on P2PBNM and to highlight initiatives regarding the use of P2P technology in network management. Furthermore, such initiatives are classified in respect to proposed review questions. Finally, future trends are discussed in order to predict what the future holds for P2PBNM.",

abstract="To facilitate the travel preparation process to a city, a lot of work has been done to recommend a POI or a sequence of POIs automatically to satisfy users' needs. However, most of the existing work ignores the issue of planning the detailed travel routes between POIs, leaving the task to online map services or commercial GPS navigators. Such a service or navigator in terms of suggesting the shortest travel distance or time, which cannot meet the diverse requirements of users. For instance, in the case of traveling by driving for leisure purpose, the scenic view along the travel routes would be of great importance to users, and a good planning service should put the sceneries of the route in higher priority rather than the distance or time taken. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called ScenicPlanner for route recommendation, leveraging a combination of geotagged image and check-in digital footprints from locationbased social networks (LBSNs). First, we enrich the road network and assign a proper scenic view score to each road segment to model the scenic road network, by extracting relevant information from geo-tagged images and check-ins. Then, we apply heuristic algorithms to iteratively add road segment and determine the travelling order of added road segments with the objective of maximizing the total scenic view score while satisfying the user-specified constraints (i.e., origin, destination and the total travel distance). Finally, to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world data sets from the Bay Area in the city of San Francisco, which contain a road network crawled from OpenStreetMap, more than 31 000 geo-tagged images generated by 1 571 Flickr users in one year, and 110 214 check-ins left by 15 680 Foursquare users in six months.",

abstract="Family firms add to the economic and social well-being of countries. While research on heterogeneity of family firms is gaining momentum, it has mostly been gender-neutral. The study fills this gap by examining heterogeneity of family firms owned and managed by women, in the context of a developing country---Brazil. The study draws upon the resource-based view of the firm to investigate the relationships between firm performance, family involvement, and financial resources at the start-up phase. An inductive analysis reveals two patterns. First, family firms that are started with the family achieve better performance than firms that are launched without the family and later evolve into a family business. Second, family firms that are funded with women entrepreneur's own savings achieve worse performance than family firms that are started with borrowed funds. The results are useful for strategic decision making in fostering family businesses headed by women and proactive public policies for future innovation to enhance the success of women entrepreneurs.",

title="Sequential information gathering schemes for spatial risk and decision analysis applications",

year="2017",
month="Oct",
day="31",
abstract="Several risk and decision analysis applications are characterized by spatial elements: there are spatially dependent uncertain variables of interest, decisions are made at spatial locations, and there are opportunities for spatial data acquisition. Spatial dependence implies that the data gathered at one coordinate could inform and assist a decision maker at other locations as well, and one should account for this learning effect when analyzing and comparing information gathering schemes. In this paper, we present concepts and methods for evaluating sequential information gathering schemes in spatial decision situations. Static and sequential information gathering schemes are outlined using the decision theoretic notion of value of information, and we use heuristics for approximating the value of sequential information in large-size spatial applications. We illustrate the concepts using a Bayesian network example motivated from risks associated with CO2 sequestration. We present a case study from mining where there are risks of rock hazard in the tunnels, and information about the spatial distribution of joints in the rocks may lead to a better allocation of resources for choosing rock reinforcement locations. In this application, the spatial variables are modeled by a Gaussian process. In both examples there can be large values associated with adaptive information gathering.",

abstract="This study addresses whether augmented reality (AR)-based online wearable guides are better at improving learners' situational interest (with regard to the fields of novelty, challenge, attention demand, exploration intention, instant enjoyment, and total interest) and learning achievement (remembering, understanding, and analyzing) compared with audio guides. This study employed a museum as its research site and examined a total of 96 participants who were randomly divided into two groups: one group using AR-based online wearable guides and the other using audio guides. In the experiment, both groups were required to complete a prior knowledge quiz, a scale of situational interest, and a test of learning achievement, as well as contributing post-activity open-format feedback. The results of this study indicate that situational interest and the remembering dimension of learning achievement have a significant and positive correlation, and that, when compared with the audio guide, the AR-based online wearable guide increased the learners' situational interest and instant enjoyment, as well as the remembering dimension of learning performance. Therefore, the AR-based online wearable guide exhibits the ability to cultivate long-term interest in informal curricula. It is suggested that, when applying AR-based online wearable guides in informal curricula, content difficulty levels should be designed appropriately so that the learners' instant enjoyment, situational interest, and content remembering performance would not be undermined.",

abstract="The design strategy of a food process must be aimed to provide food safety while retaining optimal organoleptic and nutritional characteristics and, possibly, to optimize the energy consumption. As a matter of fact, it represents a challenge in food process engineering. In this framework, it is essential to determine the interactions among transport phenomena (mass, heat, and momentum) and any other relevant physics for further optimal design and for driving possible innovation. In other technological sectors (like automotive or aerospace industries), virtualization and mathematical modeling are standard methods used for optimal design, while in food process engineering the contribution of such tools has not been fully exploited. Since virtualization represents a new and sophisticated strategic tool to design and to innovate a process, the objective of this review was to introduce virtualization and mathematical modeling in the food processing industry. For this purpose, motivation and needs for virtualization in food processing were focused, mathematical modeling background and various approaches for modeling were introduced, and solution methods and required initial--boundary conditions with thermal-physical properties were outlined. Also complexity, computational cost, and model validation techniques were critically discussed. Virtualization and mathematical modeling dominate the major requirements to design, optimize, and innovate food processing with their vast opportunities and potentials and they will become a cornerstone of utmost importance to food engineering domain.",

The outcome of the analysis elaborates a summary about the inadequacy of applicative use of quantum cryptography in WSN and presents an overview of all possible applicative challenges and problems while designing quantum-based security systems for WSN.

We analyze the workload profiles of both systems and find that the frame detection unit has by far the highest computational load. Based on this analysis, we propose a simple architecture that uses only a scalar datapath. To optimize for low energy consumption, we introduce application specific instructions that minimize register accesses and include address generation units for streamlined memory access. Next, we derive energy-optimal operation settings for different channel conditions. We find that if target signal detection probability is greater than 0.9 and false alarm probability is less than 0.1, then for both good and bad channel conditions, our baseband processor has the lowest energy when the frame detection algorithm uses the longest correlation window and the highest detection threshold value.",

Performance modeling based on data mining is an effective way to help managers predict personnel's capabilities and to recruit appropriate new staff with relevant skills, which can be significant to ensure an enterprise's competitiveness. The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is the most common classification algorithm in cases of no prior knowledge of data distribution. In the paper, an improved KNN algorithm was proposed to cope with the human performance prediction problem with the improvements in three aspects, which are the neighboring distance calculation based on entropy, the classification determination strategy, and the quantitative description method of human performance. The improved KNN algorithm was proved to have better classification ability in comparison with other seven typical KNN algorithms and five classic classification algorithms using data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The improved KNN algorithm was further tested with a real-world case of performance prediction, and the effectiveness of the algorithm was confirmed.",

abstract="In recent years, IP (Internet Protocol)-based video surveillance has widely been useful for post-event analysis and assisting the work of privacy protection and public safety. To support high-quality IP video surveillance, error-resilience techniques are important for surveillance system design, because video has more stringent requirements than general video transmission for packet loss, latency, and jitter. The optimal FEC (forward error correction) code rate decision is a crucial procedure to determine the optimal source and channel coding rates to minimize the overall picture distortion when transporting video packets over packet loss channels. The conventional FEC code rate decision schemes using an analytical source-coding distortion model and a channel-induced distortion model are usually complex and typically employ the process of model parameter training, which involves potentially high computational complexity and implementation cost. To avoid the complex modeling procedure, we propose a simple but accurate joint source-channel distortion model to estimate the channel-loss threshold set for optimal FEC code rate decision. Since the proposed model is expressed as a simple closed form and has a small number of scene-dependent model parameters, a video sender of the surveillance system using the model can be easily implemented. For training the scene-dependent model parameters in real time, we propose a practical test-run procedure. This method accelerates the test-run while maintaining its accuracy for training the scene-dependent model parameters. Using the proposed simple model and practical test-run method, the video sender can find the optimal code rate for on-the-fly joint source-channel coding whenever there is a change in the packet-loss condition in the channel. Simulations show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the channel loss threshold set, resulting in an optimal FEC code rate with low computational complexity.",

Ideally, indoor multi-modal interactions and ambient changes happened in smart homes could be monitored using ambient intelligence technology for instantaneous human behavior analysis and following human-centered interactions. Such quick feedbacks are significant to the elderly and disabled people, because a successful smart living environment could greatly reduce the burden on their home cares by offering appropriate assistance according to recognized human behaviors. However, due to varied behavioral patterns and imprecise data acquisition, realizing complex human activity in real-time without controversy over privacy is one of the biggest challenges for scientific community. In this paper, we propose an innovative inference engine based on formal concept analysis to recognize complex human activities, including sequential, interleaved, and concurrent patterns performed by an occupant in non-intrusive smart homes. Besides the on-the-fly recognition, our engine adopts a loose coupling architecture that strengthens the software robustness, reliability, and knowledge reusability.",

abstract="With increasing technological improvements, production processes are becoming more and more automated. Nevertheless, full automation is improbable in the medium term since human abilities cannot yet be completely replaced. Therefore, it is likely that so-called hybrid human--robot teams will assume the future production. This raises questions regarding the shaping of future production and the effects it will have on the employees, workstations, and the companies as a whole. The project ``Work in the Industry of the Future'' (ARIZ) addresses the entirely new cooperative relationship between man and technology in the Industry 4.0 and its impact on opportunities for the work force. To derive the requirements and effects of hybrid workplaces, an initial work analysis of existing workplaces with varying levels of technological enhancement (manual workplaces, workplaces with co-existing robots and fully automated workplaces) will be conducted. Multiple standardized work analysis instruments that vary in method, duration, level of analysis, and recorded characteristics already exist. This paper gives an overview of an assortment of these methods that can be used in production.",

abstract="Big data technology enables us to access tremendous amounts of information; however, individuals cannot process all available information due to the bounded attention. The impact of this tension upon information seeking and processing behaviors and the resultant decision-making quality is still unclear. By agent-based simulation, we explicitly model the endogenous information choice in a sequential decision-making process, where individuals choose independently how much information and what type of information (shallow information such as the popularity a product, or deep information such as the expected utility of a product) is to be used. It is found that when the information is costly, only a small part of the individuals use deep information and only limited pieces of it, and other individuals simply follow the majority choice. The decrease in the cost of of information cost due to big data can encourage individuals to make use of more information, resulting in a better overall decision quality. However, if the big data only reduces the cost of shallow information but not that of the deep information, the decision quality is diminished because more individuals are induced to adopt the herding strategy.",

abstract="Information Systems researchers demonstrate that organizations are very often influenced by external environment; success of an organization and its associated industry is largely dependent on how they respond to the external factors. Although a number of external factors have been explored in literature, still little is known on their degree of impact and hence their relative importance. Therefore, advancing research on organizational external (environmental) responsiveness requires clarifying the theoretical conceptualizations and validating the associated dimensions. After conducting an extensive literature search followed by a qualitative and quantitative study, the current study develops and validates a multi-dimensional hierarchical model of external responsiveness and investigates its effect on adoption intention. The findings of the study show that; in the context of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, external responsiveness is a third-order, reflective construct which is reflected by external pressure (further is reflected by government pressure, market pressure, mimetic pressure, and normative pressure), external support (reflected by government support, vendor support, and associative support), and external uncertainty (reflected by market and technology uncertainty). Moreover, the impact of the third-order and second-order constructs on the endogenous variable (i.e. intention to adopt RFID) is examined and found to have positive influences. This study is the first reported attempt that categorizes the dimensions of external responsiveness and validates with empirical data. This study concludes with implications and future research directions.",

The paper initially provides a snapshot of Australian book publishing in a global context, and then summarizes our findings on the current and potential future impact of digital technologies. The original research employed an interpretive research paradigm, using a mixed methodology design, including an online survey of book publishers and the conduct of 14 case studies. The extension of the original research project led to its being given a more global dimension. In reporting this new research, the paper discusses in detail the diverse range of technologies, their limitations and the risks and opportunities they offer to the book publishing industry.

abstract="The ultra wideband (UWB) radio signals are known for their good time resolution enabling implementation of accurate localization and tracking. The recent appearance of commercial UWB transceivers in masses on the market has boosted the interest towards this technology and facilitated its use not just for research, but also for business. In this paper we focus on the problem of UWB-based wireless indoor localization of machines and humans by means of IEEE 802.15.4-2015 high rate pulse repetition UWB technology and specifically the accuracy of such localization. Namely, we report the results of an extensive experimental study revealing the effect of various communication settings on the accuracy of indoor localization for the proposed earlier asymmetric localization protocol. The conducted experiments lasted over 200 hours almost nonstop and involved transmission of more than 30 million ranging packets. In the experiments we have tested over 200 different modes and explored the effect of seven different parameters on the UWB ranging performance. The presented results reveal that the communication settings need to be accounted for when determining the time of flight using UWB. Also we show that the accuracy of ranging is strongly affected by the used channel, data rate and pulse repetition frequency. Finally, we note that the increase of the UWB transceiver's temperature due to self-heating has a strong effect on the results of the localization.",

abstract="The large wind generating set works under the varying operation conditions for years, generally the fault characteristic values of the rotary components based on the energy mode is coupled with other noises, so the fault trend can not be accurately predicted. With the wear fault of the high-speed gear of the wind generator as the research object, this paper proposes the trend prediction method of the wear fault of the high-speed gear based on the fusion of ultra-complete independent component analysis (UICA) and parameter estimation (PE), constructs the ultra-complete analysis model, separates the similar source signals more than mixing signals by using the UICA, and finds useful component with the features of the pure similar fault source signal as the basis. Based on the similarity between the similar fault source signal and fault source signal, this paper estimates the value domain of the magnification time of the similar shapes by using the PE, identifies the mapping between continuous and one-way varying magnification time domain and rotary component fault degree, establishes the fault degree judgment standard, and determines and predicts the fault degree and the fault trend based on the energy change trend diagram of the whole-lifecycle fault source signal of the high-speed gear. The above method is used to process the wear fault data of the high-speed gear. The results indicate that the above method has obvious effect in processing of the cycle sudden signals, so it indicates that this method has certain engineering application value and provides reference to solve the problem that the number of the independent vibration sources is more than it of the mixing signals in vibration analysis.",

In spite of the considerable amount of progress made into the understanding of neuronal organization and communication, reducing the knowledge gap between brain cellular biology and behavioral studies remains a huge challenge. Mind-to-mind communication has been the subject of numerous science fiction writings, intense research and emotional debates for many years. Scientists have tried for a long time to achieve transmission of messages between living subjects via non intrusive protocols. Thanks to the great progress made in imagery and neurosciences, another dimension of neuronal function in communication has now been documented. Two recent experimental demonstrations of direct brain to brain communication without physical contact (Grau et al.

Environmental improvements, social responsibilities and economic opportunities led many manufacturers to implement different kinds of end-of-life (EoL) strategies. However, in many cases, these strategies are not supported by a correct commitment of top managers, but are implemented only in response to competitor's actions. This paper aims to improve the understanding of management practices concerning remanufacturing activities. A mixed evaluation model based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed. Its final aim is the evaluation of top management commitment in driving remanufacturing as an overall sustainable initiative into three different sectors (automotive, aerospace and medical equipments).

abstract="A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of many sensors that communicate wirelessly to monitor a physical region. Location information is critical essential and indispensable for many applications of WSNs. A promising solution for localizing statically deployed sensors is to benefit from mobile location-aware nodes called beacons. However, the essential problem is to find the optimum path that the mobile beacon should travel in order to improve localization accuracy, time and success as well as energy efficiency. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of five mobile beacon trajectories; Random Way Point, Scan, Hilbert, Circles and Localization algorithm with a Mobile Anchor node based on Trilateration (LMAT) based on three different localization techniques such as Weighted Centroid Localization and trilateration with time priority and accuracy priority. This evaluation aims to find effective and essential properties that the trajectory should have. Our simulations show that a random movement cannot guarantee the performance of localization. The results also show the efficiency of LMAT regarding accuracy, success and collinearity while the Hilbert space filling curve has lower energy consumption. Circles path planning can help to localize unknown sensors faster than others at the expense of lower localization precision.",

abstract="Reducing the total power consumption and network delay are among the most interesting issues facing large-scale Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) systems and their ability to satisfy the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Such systems utilize cloud computing infrastructure to support offloading some of user's computationally heavy tasks to the cloud's datacenters. However, the delay incurred by such offloading process lead the use of servers (called cloudlets) placed in the physical proximity of the users, creating what is known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The cloudlet-based infrastructure has its challenges such as the limited capabilities of the cloudlet system (in terms of the ability to serve different request types from users in vast geographical regions). To cover the users demand for different types of services and in vast geographical regions, cloudlets cooperate among each other by passing user requests from one cloudlet to another. This cooperation affects both power consumption and delay. In this work, we present a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model for MEC systems with these two issues in mind. Specifically, we consider two types of cloudlets: local cloudlets and global cloudlets, which have higher capabilities. A user connects to a local cloudlet and sends all of its traffics to it. If the local cloudlet cannot serve the desired request, then the request is moved to another local cloudlet. If no local cloudlet can serve the request, then it is moved to a global cloudlet which can serve all service types. The process of routing requests through the hierarchical network of cloudlets increases power consumption and delay. Our model minimizes power consumption while incurring an acceptable amount of delay. We evaluate it under several realistic scenarios to show that it can indeed be used for power optimization of large-scale MEC systems without violating delay constraints.",

For example, Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) can improve the quality of manufacturing and many aspects in our daily life; both of them rely heavily on the cloud computing platform to develop. Central to this paradigm shift is the need to keep any common data, often held at remote outsourced locations and usually to be accessed by different authorized parties, secure from being leaked to unauthorized entities. When using the cloud services, consumer may want to encrypt sensitive data before uploading it to the cloud, but this will also eliminate the possibility to search the data efficiently in the cloud storage. A more practical solution to this is to employ a searchable encryption scheme in the cloud storage, so that user can query the encrypted data efficiently without revealing the sensitive data to the service provider. Besides the security and search features, performance of searchable encryption schemes is also very important when it comes to practical applications. In this paper, we propose several techniques to accelerate the search performance of encrypted data stored on the cloud. Notably, our techniques include massively parallel file encryption, multi-array keyword red black tree (KRBT) implementation, batched keyword search and enhanced parallel search in KRBT. To the best of our knowledge, SearchaStore is the first work that attempts to accelerate searchable encryption using GPU technology.",

abstract="Traditional methods to evaluate the human motivation in companies include surveys, statistical techniques and psychological analysis. However, generating the required information using these methods is very costly and time demanding. As a solution, Industry 4.0 paradigm allows integrating Ambient Intelligence systems into the daily industrial operations in order to digitalize those activities. This paper proposes a solution to automatically assess the human motivation in Industry 4.0 scenarios with Ambient Intelligence infrastructure. The estimation is based on both physiological and emotional signals which are acquired (through on-body and environmental sensors) and processed in real-time using web services. The final representation of the human motivation is based on the extended Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Moreover, an experimental validation is provided, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution.",

We also investigated the dependence of analyte overlap integral (also called fill fraction) of the resonant mode as well as the effect of group index of the coupling waveguide at the resonant wavelength of the microcavity. In addition to the cavity properties, absorbance of the sensing medium or analyte together with the affinity constant of the probe and target biomarkers involved in the biochemical reaction also limits the minimum detection limits.

abstract="The popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is rapidly growing due to its wide-ranged applications such as industrial diagnostics, environment monitoring or surveillance. High-quality construction of WSNs is increasingly demanding due to the ubiquity of WSNs. The current work is focused on improving one of the most crucial criteria that appear to exert an enormous impact on the WSNs performance, namely the area coverage. The proposed model is involved with sensor nodes deployment which maximizes the area coverage. This problem is proved to be NP-hard. Although such algorithms to handle this problem with fairly acceptable solutions had been introduced, most of them still heavily suffer from several issues including the large computation time and solution instability. Hence, the existing work proposed ways to overcome such difficulties by proposing two nature-based algorithms, namely Improved Cuckoo Search (ICS) and Chaotic Flower Pollination algorithm (CFPA). By adopting the concept of calculating the adaptability and a well-designed local search in previous studies, those two algorithms are able to improve their performance. The experimental results on 15 instances established a huge enhancement in terms of computation time, solution quality and stability.",

abstract="Controlling the properties of piezoelectric thin films is a key aspect for designing highly efficient flexible electromechanical devices. In this study, the crystallographic phenomena of PbZr1--x                                Ti                  x                O3 (PZT) thin films caused by distinguished interfacial effects are deeply investigated by overlooking views, including not only an experimental demonstration but also ab initio modeling. The polymorphic phase balance and crystallinity, as well as the crystal orientation of PZT thin films at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), can be stably modulated using interfacial crystal structures. Here, interactions with MgO stabilize the PZT crystallographic system well and induce the texturing influences, while the PZT film remains quasi-stable on a conventional Al2O3 wafer. On the basis of this fundamental understanding, a high-output flexible energy harvester is developed using the controlled-PZT system, which shows significantly higher performance than the unmodified PZT generator. The voltage, current, and power densities are improved by 556{\%}, 503{\%}, and 822{\%}, respectively, in comparison with the previous flexional single-crystalline piezoelectric device. Finally, the improved flexible generator is applied to harvest tiny vibrational energy from a real traffic system, and it is used to operate a commercial electronic unit. These results clearly indicate that atomic-scale designs can produce significant impacts on macroscopic applications.",

Wireless Sensor Networks are the base technology of Smart cities. These networks are in charge to sense physical variables that could feedback the behaviour of humans. These sensors usually send data to a cloud server for applying big data technology in order to discover behaviour patterns of humans. In this way a smart city could take corrective actions in order to reduce, for example, polluted air in a critical zone. But the sensors and the backbone network that send data to that server also consume electric power. Usually the wireless backbone elements are always turned on, which could incur a high pattern of electric energy consumption.

abstract="The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), based on the well-known triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction effect, has been proven to be a simple, cost effective approach for self-powered systems to convert ambient mechanical energy into electricity. We report a flexible and transparent paper-based triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG) consisting of an indium tin oxide (ITO) film and a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film as the triboelectric surfaces, which not only acts as an energy supply but also as a self-powered active sensor. It can harvest kinetic energy when the sheets of paper come into contact, bend or slide relative to one another by a combination of vertical contact-separation mode and lateral sliding mode. In addition, we also integrate grating-structured PTENGs into a book as a self-powered anti-theft sensor. The mechanical agitation during handling the book pages can be effectively converted into an electrical output to either drive a commercial electronic device or trigger a warning buzzer. Furthermore, different grating-structures on each page produce different numbers of output peaks by sliding relative to one another, which can accurately act as a page mark and record the number of pages turned.

abstract="Despite the importance of governance processes for destination management and the impact of digital technology on such processes, surprisingly little academic research has explored the use of digital technology to transform public governance in the tourism sector. This conceptual paper fills this gap by conducting a digital government stakeholder analysis for the tourism sector using the digital government evolution model as its theoretical foundation. The analysis identifies six relevant stakeholder groups: governments, businesses, non-profits, citizens, visitors and employees. It examines six types of technology-enabled interactions between government and other stakeholders: government-to-government, government-to-business, government-to-non-profit, government-to-citizen, government-to-visitor and government-to-employee. These interactions are illustrated with real-life examples. The analysis contributes to identifying pressures on tourism authorities and determining how the authorities respond to such pressures, how they innovate their operations and policies with digital technologies, and how these innovations are institutionalized over time. The results contribute to building the theoretical foundations for  sector-specific digital government and enable strategic discussion on the use of commercially viable and socially responsible digital innovation to advance the tourism sector.",

title="An improved ant colony optimization-based approach with mobile sink for wireless sensor networks",
journal="The Journal of Supercomputing",
year="2017",
month="Aug",
day="01",
abstract="Traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with one static sink node suffer from the well-known hot spot problem, that of sensor nodes near the static sink bear more traffic load than outlying nodes. Thus, the overall network lifetime is reduced due to the fact some nodes deplete their energy reserves much faster compared to the rest. Recently, adopting sink mobility has been considered as a good strategy to overcome the hot spot problem. Mobile sink(s) physically move within the network and communicate with selected nodes, such as cluster heads (CHs), to perform direct data collection through short-range communications that requires no routing. Finding an optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink is critical in order to achieve energy efficiency. Taking hints from nature, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been seen as a good solution to finding an optimal traversal path. Whereas the traditional ACO algorithm will guide ants to take a small step to the next node using current information, over time they will deviate from the target. Likewise, a mobile sink may communicate with selected node for a relatively long time making the traditional ACO algorithm delays not suitable for high real-time WSNs applications. In this paper, we propose an improved ACO algorithm approach for WSNs that use mobile sinks by considering CH distances. In this research, the network is divided into several clusters and each cluster has one CH. While the distance between CHs is considered under the traditional ACO algorithm, the mobile sink node finds an optimal mobility trajectory to communicate with CHs under our improved ACO algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve wireless sensor network performance compared to other routing algorithms.",

As one of the most important aspect of this technical-driven smart home system, learning and recognizing the occupant's routine activities and movement patterns is the foundation of further human behavior understanding and prediction process. In this paper, we propose a decomposition based unsupervised learning approach, which is able to learn the occupant's moving patterns directly from the sensor data without event annotations. It overcomes the limitation suffered by a lot of other supervised learning approaches that sensor data sets with event annotations are not difficult to collect since manually data labeling is not scalable and extremely time consuming. By applying the proposed method on Aruba motion sensor data set, we show that the decomposition based pattern learning method leverages the well-developed Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm that it can learn the movement pattern candidates of the occupant very fast, with outputs that can be easily interpreted.",

abstract="In recent years, the number of applications utilizing mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has increased, with the intent of localization for the purposes of monitoring and obtaining data from hazardous areas. Location of the event is very critical in WSN, as sensing data is almost meaningless without the location information. In this paper, two Monte Carlo based localization schemes termed MCL and MSL* are studied. MCL obtains its location through anchor nodes whereas MSL* uses both anchor nodes and normal nodes. The use of normal nodes would increase accuracy and reduce dependency on anchor nodes, but increases communication costs. For this reason, we introduce a new approach called low communication cost schemes to reduce communication cost. Unlike MSL* which chooses all normal nodes found in the neighbor, the proposed scheme uses set theory to only select intersected nodes. To evaluate our method, we simulate in our proposed scheme the use of the same MSL* settings and simulators. From the simulation, we find out that our proposed scheme is able to reduce communication cost---the number of messages sent---by a minimum of 0.02 and a maximum of 0.30 with an average of 0.18, for varying node densities from 6 to 20, while nonetheless able to retain similar MSL* accuracy rates.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) has been considered as one of the most promising technologies over the next decade. One of the basic requirements of IoT is the global communication connectivity between smart objects. LTE-A has been considered as the main communication channel for connecting devices. For this reason, the machine-type communication (MTC) has been defined in the 3GPP LTE-A specification. With the rapid growth of the IoT devices, MTC in LTE-A faces many challenges. The primary design of a LTE-A network is to support the human-type communication (HTC). However, MTC and HTC have different characteristics, such as packet size, traffic arrival rate, and delay tolerance. How to accommodate a large amount of MTC traffic without affecting the grade of service of the HTC is challenging. More specifically, before accessing the LTE-A network, a random access (RA) procedure needs to be performed by a device to synchronize in the uplink of an eNB. Since the number of MTC devices is expected to be much greater than the HTC devices, without suitable access control, the success rate of the RA requests from the HTC devices can be significantly degraded. Therefore, this research aims to design an appropriate RA procedure to relieve this problem. The authors propose an Adaptive RACH Resource Allocation (ARRA) which integrates several control schemes, including a Resource Allocation scheme, an Access Class Barring scheme, and a Priority Device Setting scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed ARRA is able to achieve a higher access success rate and a lower latency for HTC devices while providing a different quality of service to different types of MTC devices.",

The rest 135 images were used as test set. Further, we chose the latest powerful technique---convolutional neural network (CNN) based on convolutional layer, rectified linear unit layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and softmax layer. We also compared three different pooling techniques: max pooling, average pooling, and stochastic pooling. The results showed that our method achieved a sensitivity of 96.88{\%}, a specificity of 97.18{\%}, and an accuracy of 97.04{\%}. Our method was better than three state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, stochastic pooling performed better than other max pooling and average pooling. We validated CNN with five convolution layers and two fully connected layers performed the best.

abstract="For the purpose of accurate diagnosis and early treatment for cancers, the classification and identification of different tumors is the key problem of computer-aided diagnosis system. In this paper, an improved semi-supervised tumor identification method is proposed, which takes advantage of the Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and offers a pathological degree tree based on ten three-dimentional (3-D) and two dimentional(2-D) tumor features. In addition, a great deal of complicated data processing is distributed in the fog computing architecture. First, we carry out the segmentation of tumors by using FRFCM algorithm, and complete the 3-D modeling. Then, the pathological shape features of 3-D and 2-D tumors are extracted from modeling, for constructing a group of feature vector. Finally, based on the landmark information of labeled samples provided by standard database and experts, we realize an improved semi-supervised FCM clustering to guide the tumor identification. The experiments are conducted by using medical CT scans of 143 patients including 452 tumors. Overall, the best average identification accuracy of                                                                   {\$}{\$}94.6{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                                                                            94.6                      {\%}                                                                     has been recorded for this proposed method, the ability of machine learning to recognize the benign, malignant and false-positive tumors is improved effectively under imbalanced data sets.",

abstract="The increasing popularity and usage of internet based services makes design of software system complex and their power unlimited in scale. These systems often involve heterogeneous environment and platforms. They continuously evolve in order to meet the changes in technology and business practices. Emergence of information system architecture based on disparate externally provided internet based services warrant incorporation of novel design primitives in the application design. Traditionally popular application design primitives includes separation, abstraction, compression, uniform composition, replication and resource sharing that has evolved and came to vogue based on past experience and expert practice. This work examines and evaluates approaches to incorporation of new and novel unit operations around which applications can be architected, designed and analyzed for the internet computing and big data era. Incidentally it is found that portions of agent technology provides several unit operations such as migration of code and speech-act based responsibility delegation/application composition as application architectural primitives. This work determines extensions to Web Services-Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) programming framework---called as ACtive Internet Application Framework (ACIAF) and is suited for incorporation of novel unit operations such as migration of code and speech-act based component orchestration/application composition to enable construction of next generation information systems. An analysis of merits and demerits of using WS-BPEL technology to realize ACIAF is also carried out here. Code mobility feature of ACIAF is demonstrated using a use case while loosely coupled application design using ACIAF is theoretically discussed. Formal analyzability of mobility behavior of ACIAF application is highlighted based on its conformance to Petri-net formalism. Further formal logical analyzability/interpolatability of individual actions performed by collaborating ACIAF applications is also highlighted. It is argued here that ACIAF shall provide necessary foundation, guidance and motivation for further detailed technical work on several ideas presented to realize next generation information systems. This work firmly establishes extension to WS-BPEL platform as a most viable approach to realize novel architectural primitives to the design and implementation of next generation information systems.",

Recognizing human movement activity types is extremely useful for fall detection for elderly people. Wireless sensor network technology enables human motion data from wearable wireless sensor devices be transmitted for remote processing. This paper studies methods to process the human motion data received from wearable wireless sensor devices for detecting different types of human movement activities such as sitting, standing, lying, fall, running, and walking. Machine learning methods K Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) and the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm are used to classify the activities from the data acquired from sensors based on sample data. As there are a large amount of real-time raw data received from sensors and there are noises associated with these data, feature construction and reduction are used to preprocess these raw sensor data obtained from accelerometers embedded in wireless sensing motes for learning and processing. The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is used for constructing the enriched features. The enriched features are then integrated with machine learning algorithms for movement detection. The testing data are collected from five adults. Experimental results show that our methods can achieve promising performance on human movement recognition and fall detection.",

As a result, these technologies seem to have a very promising future in the manufacturing industry. However, most of the current applications are based on the use of expensive proprietary software packages (such as specific CAD modules). This work presents a methodology that helps programmers to build virtual and augmented reality systems, which is valid for a broad number of industrial plants. Differently to other approaches, ours is based on open technologies, most of them free of cost. The technologies proposed to build the virtual worlds are already mature at the entertainment industry. The presented approach opens new possibilities for creating virtual reality models aimed at two major directions: (1) pure simulation of real processes and products for different purposes (e.g. staff training; prototype designing; manufacturing optimization; marketing) and (2) teleoperation of real processes (e.g. in dangerous environments or in micro and macro scale manufacturing). The application of the methodology is illustrated by means of the creation of a non-immersive virtual world which represents a part-classifying station, allowing both the simulation of the real plant as well as its remote operation.",

First, as stated in McKinsey {\&} Company's Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products -- consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner's reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009.

Studies have mostly emphasized theoretical approaches rather than being practical studies. In this study, a roadmap for radio frequency identification design, configuration and deployment is presented in order to design an integrated approach as pointed out in the literature and in former radio frequency identification projects. Additionally, an application is performed for validation and reinforcing of the understanding of the proposed radio frequency identification implementation roadmap; an architectural framework and economic feasibility are also discussed. The most striking result from the case study is that a radio frequency identification application could be successfully implemented to support the tracking and tracing of work in process in denim production processes, an area in which studies about radio frequency identification applications have not been done. Besides this, redundant inventory and production costs, redundant labour costs caused by inefficient production activities, inaccuracies of records, incorrect order deliveries and penalty costs incurred by customers are significantly reduced, which provides invaluable advantages in the real-life competition of the denim product industry.",

Therefore, evaluating, ranking and selecting the most appropriate cloud solution to manage big data project is a complex concern which required multi criteria decision environment. In this paper we propose a hybrid TOPSIS method combined with intuitionistic fuzzy set to select appropriate cloud solution to manage big data projects in group decision making environment. In order to collate individual opinions of decision makers for rating the importance of various criteria and alternatives, we employed intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator.

However, as the number of available cloud services increases, the problem of data discovery and selection arises. The semantic technology is an effective choice for enhancing the accurate of the data searching and analyzing process. In this paper, a semantic based cloud environment is proposed to facilitate the analyzing and searching process of surveillance video data. An architecture integrating ontology building, semantic annotation, and semantic search is proposed to leverage the semantic description of the video data to find them from concept-based level. A semantic intermediate layer which organizes the video data based on their semantic relations is given. Moreover, the proposed method is used in the intelligent transportation field, which shows the bright prospect of the proposed method in real applications.",

abstract="In this research we studied the assimilation process of a technological innovation (i.e. technovation) called Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Like many other technovations, RFID is considered as a revolutionary one, but its assimilation is an evolutionary process. Here, we extended the conventional assimilation theories and initiated an intellectual argument by introducing extension as an important stage of assimilation, which is contextual and highly relevant for RFID assimilation process. Data for the empirical tests were collected via survey from 221 livestock farms in Australia that are using RFID for livestock identification and tracing. We examined ten Technology-Organization-Environmental (TOE) factors on four stages of RFID assimilation process. Empirical results, based on Partial Least Square (PLS)-based Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), suggest that assimilation of RFID technovation does involve four stages: initiation, adoption, routinization, and extension. We also found that one single factor may have different effect on different stages of assimilation, which may even be different directioned. For instance, external environmental uncertainty has a positive impact on RFID adoption while it has a negative impact on RFID extension. The paper discusses the results and practical implications in detail.",

abstract="On-line walking speed control in human-powered exoskeleton systems is a big challenge, the translations of human intention to increase or decrease walking speed in maneuverable human exoskeleton systems is still complex field. In this paper, we propose a novel sensing technique to control the walking speed of the system according to the pilot intentions and to minimize the interaction force. We introduce a new sensing technology ``Dual Reaction Force (DRF)'' sensors, and explain the methodology of using it in the investigation of walking speed changing intentions. The force signals mismatch successfully applied to control the walking speed of the exoskeleton system according to the pilot intentions. Typical issues on the implementation of the sensory system are experimentally validated on flat terrain walking trails. We developed an adaptive trajectory frequency control algorithm to control the walking speed of HUman-powered Augmentation Lower Exoskeleton (HUALEX) within the human wearer intended speed. Based on the mismatch of DRF sensors, we proposed a new control methodology for walking speed control. Human intention recognition and identification through an sensorized footboard and smart shoe is achieved successfully in this work, the new term heel contact time H                                          C                  T                 is main feedback signal for the control algorithm. From the experimental walking trails we found that, the H                                          C                  T                 during flat walking ranges from 0.69{\textpm}0.05 sec and 0.41{\textpm}0.07 sec while walking speed varies between 1m/s and 2.5m/s. The proposed algorithm used an Adaptive Central Pattern Generators (ACPGs) applied to control joint trajectory frequency, the different walking speeds associated with different functioning of human body CPGs frequency. We validated the proposed control algorithm by simulations on single Degree of Freedom (1-DoF) exoskeleton platform, the simulation results show the efficiency and validated that the proposed control algorithm will provides a good walking speed control for the HUALEX exoskeleton system.",

abstract="Many applications of location based services (LBSs), it is useful or even necessary to ensure that LBSs services determine their location. For continuous queries where users report their locations periodically, attackers can infer more about users' privacy by analyzing the correlations of their query samples. The causes of path privacy problems, which emerge because the communication by different users in road network using location based services so, attacker can track continuous query information. LBSs, albeit useful and convenient, pose a serious threat to users' path privacy as they are enticed to reveal their locations to LBS providers via their queries for location-based information. Traditional path privacy solutions designed in Euclidean space can be hardly applied to road network environment because of their ignorance of network topological properties. In this paper, we proposed a novel dynamic path privacy protection scheme for continuous query service in road networks. Our scheme also conceals DPP (Dynamic Path Privacy) users' identities from adversaries; this is provided in initiator untraceability property of the scheme. We choose the different attack as our defending target because it is a particularly challenging attack that can be successfully launched without compromising any user or having access to any cryptographic keys. The security analysis shows that the model can effectively protect the user identity anonymous, location information and service content in LBSs. All simulation results confirm that our Dynamic Path Privacy scheme is not only more accurate than the related schemes, but also provide better locatable ratio where the highest it can be around 95 {\%} of unknown nodes those can estimate their position. Furthermore, the scheme has good computation cost as well as communication and storage costs.Simulation results show that Dynamic Path Privacy has better performances compared to some related region based algorithms such as IAPIT scheme, half symmetric lens based localization algorithm (HSL) and sequential approximate maximum a posteriori (AMAP) estimator scheme.",

abstract="Recent real medical datasets show that the number of outpatients in China has sharply increased since 2013, when the Chinese health insurance reform started. This situation leads to increased waiting time for the outpatients; in particular, the normal operation of a hospital will be congested at rush hour. The existence of this problem in outpatient departments causes a reduction in doctors' diagnostic time, and a high working strength is required to address this issue. In this paper, a simultaneous model based on machine learning is proposed for aiding outpatient doctors in performing diagnoses. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) to classify hyperlipemia using the clinical features extracted from a real medical dataset. The results, with an accuracy of 90 {\%}, indicate that our Simultaneously Aided Diagnosis Model (SADM) applied to aid diagnosis for outpatient doctors and achieves the objective of increasing efficiency and reducing working strength.",

abstract="In recent, studies on multimedia data transmission have been progressing in a wireless sensor network that consist of a large number of sensor nodes and a mobile P2P network that consists of a large of number of smart devices such as smart phones and wearable devices. When multimedia data such as image, audio, and video are transmitted, it is important to figure out the positions of a sensor nodes and a smart device in the networks. However, existing positioning schemes do not consider network holes that can occur in real application areas, thereby causing many errors during positioning. In this paper, we propose a new positioning scheme considering holes in wireless sensor and mobile P2P network environments. In the proposed scheme, holes are detected based on neighboring node density when holes exist in a network, and the position of a sensor node or a smart device is estimated by conducting distance correction based on the cumulative number of hole-boundary nodes. Through the proposed scheme, highly accurate sensor positioning can be performed even in circumstances where holes are present over a network. To verify the good performance of the proposed scheme, a performance evaluation is conducted by comparing it with existing schemes. It is shown through experiments that the proposed positioning scheme transmits multimedia data to the destination node without data loss when the holes in the network exist.",

abstract="The threat of hardware Trojans has been widely recognized by academia, industry, and government agencies. A Trojan can compromise security of a system in spite of cryptographic protection. The damage caused by a Trojan may not be limited to a business or reputation, but could have a severe impact on public safety, national economy, or national security. An extremely stealthy way of implementing hardware Trojans has been presented by Becker et al. at CHES'2012. Their work have shown that it is possible to inject a Trojan in a random number generator compliant with FIPS 140-2 and NIST SP800-90 standards by exploiting non-zero aliasing probability of Logic Built-In-Self-Test (LBIST). In this paper, we present two methods for modifying LBIST to prevent such an attack. The first method makes test patterns dependent on a configurable key which is programed into a chip after the manufacturing stage. The second method uses a remote test management system which can execute LBIST using a different set of test patterns at each test cycle.",

In the present study, a framework is presented which predicts user mobility in presence and absence of mobility history. Na{\"i}ve Bayesian classification algorithm and Markov Model are used to predict user future location when user mobility history is available. An attempt is made to predict user future location by using Short Message Service (SMS) and instantaneous Geological coordinates in the absence of mobility patterns. The proposed technique compares the performance metrics with commonly used Markov Chain model. From the experimental results it is evident that the techniques used in this work gives better results when considering both spatial and temporal information. The proposed method predicts user's future location in the absence of mobility history quite fairly.

abstract="The term ``information'' has become a universal and omnipresent keyword in almost all areas of our modern world---be it in science or society in general. This is not only obvious from the naming of whole scientific branches like Information Theory, Information Science or Informatics but even more from common speaking---characterising our present time and society as information age viz. information society. However, what ``information'' might mean, is by no means clear and there is a wide range of interpretations covering, among others, its technical, communicational, educational, mental, and scientific aspects. But is the use of the same term justified when adopted in Biology, Physics, Archaeology, Law, Communication Technology, and Informatics (to list just a few of the involved scientific branches) or do its different uses at least have some common characteristics---some sort of common denominator? Is information natural, e.g. manifesting itself as a material phenomenon residing in organisms, stars, atoms, or genes, or is it just a cultural product of human communication, thinking, and interpretation? In this article, we try to clarify some of the most important interpretations, discuss and contrast them with the Informatics point of view. Interpretations range from taking information as material, transferable signals (following Shannon's Information Theory or the genetic approaches), treating it as a sign (following a semiotic approach), as a commercial product (now common in Web-based Information Business) to considering it a pure mental phenomenon bound to humans or human-like individuals or even to groups and societies. Based on these interpretations, we shall throw a critical glance on current trends in human science and society---focusing on the now popular concept of ``information society''---and then derive some theses and guidelines for further research escorting the growth and dispersal of information technology. As it will turn out, an information society which defines itself through the number of computers, internet connections and network links is based on a very narrow, techno-centric concept of information. However, a reflection on the educational and cultural aspects of information might lead to a better-qualified society consisting of responsible and critical citizens.",

abstract="In this paper the problem of maximum lifetime routing is investigated in asynchronous duty-cycled wireless sensor networks. To model this problem, a new energy balance based asynchronous MAC protocol is proposed called K-Persistent FRTS--RCTS, which stands for K-Persistent flooding of RTS and random sending of CTS. In this protocol, each transmitter in order to send a data packet, first transmits at most K packets of RTS to its neighbors by flooding, but if the transmitter does not receive any CTS packets, it transmits the RTS packet directly to the sink. The CTS packet is sent to the transmitter either by one of the waking neighbors via a uniform random mechanism or by the sink node in response to the received RTS packet. It is shown that by using K-Persistent FRTS--RCTS MAC, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. In this problem, the optimization variables consist of the maximum number of RTS flooding requests (K) as the integer values and the flow rate of information on any route and the duty cycle of nodes both as the real values. To assess the performance of the proposed method, it is compared to the same maximum lifetime routing problem under the 1-Persistent FRTS--RCTS and the well-known X-MAC protocols. Evaluation results indicate that K-Persistent FRTS--RCTS MAC outperforms two mentioned MAC protocols in terms of both network lifetime and topology changes.",

An adoption model was developed focusing on contextual factors and constructs from two technology adoption theories. Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis and model validation. Results from 355 valid responses to a survey of information and communication technology (ICT) experts and decision makers at universities in SSA indicated that socio-cultural factors, results demonstrability, usefulness, and data security significantly impact their propensity to recommend adoption of cloud computing in the universities.

title="On CS Image Reconstruction Using LDPC Code Over Radio Mobile Channel",
journal="Wireless Personal Communications",
year="2017",
month="Nov",
day="28",
abstract="In this work, the effect of additive white Gaussian noise and fading channel on the compressed sensing or compressive sampling (CS) image reconstruction process are demonstrated. First, the work suggests encoding of the sensed samples by low density parity check code (LDPC) before transmission. It is well known that longer is the length of the LDPC codes better (lower) is the bit error rate (BER) performance. Thus to improve CS reconstruction a method to construct a larger length but 4 cycle free irregular LDPC code structure is also proposed. The code construction is based on the LDPC code in IEEE WiMAX standard. The proposed CS-LDPC structure is then extended for                                                                   {\$}{\$}4^n{\$}{\$}                                                                            4                      n                                                                    -QAM to find an optimal set of thresholds by minimizing BER (equivalently symbol error rate) using differential evolution (DE). The algorithm works on the log likelihood ratio values obtained by LDPC decoding. Extensive simulation results show the efficacy of the use of LDPC codes and the trade-off in code rate and measurements on reconstruction quality. Improved performance with the proposed DE based demodulation is also demonstrated.",

abstract="Who should decide how a machine will decide what to do when it is driving a car, performing a medical procedure, or, more generally, when it is facing any kind of morally laden decision? More and more, machines are making complex decisions with a considerable level of autonomy. We should be much more preoccupied by this problem than we currently are. After a series of preliminary remarks, this paper will go over four possible answers to the question raised above. First, we may claim that it is the maker of a machine that gets to decide how it will behave in morally laden scenarios. Second, we may claim that the users of a machine should decide. Third, that decision may have to be made collectively or, fourth, by other machines built for this special purpose. The paper argues that each of these approaches suffers from its own shortcomings, and it concludes by showing, among other things, which approaches should be emphasized for different types of machines, situations, and/or morally laden decisions.",

volume="18",
number="1",
pages="17--23",
abstract="Each of us has a personal narrative: a story that defines us, and one that we tell about ourselves to our inner and outer worlds. A strong sense of identity is rooted in a personal narrative that has coherence and correspondence (Conway in J Mem Lang 53:594--628, 2005): coherence in the sense that the story we tell is consistent with and supportive of our current version of `self'; and correspondence in the sense that the story reflects the contents of autobiographical memory and the meaning of our experiences. These goals are achieved by a reciprocal interaction of autobiographical memory and the self, in which memories consistent with the self-image are reinforced, in turn strengthening the self-image they reflect. Thus, personal narratives depend crucially on the malleable nature of autobiographical memory: a strong sense of self requires that one remember what matters, and forget what does not. Today, anyone who is active online generates a highly detailed, ever---expanding, and permanent digital biographical `memory'---memory that identifies where we go, what we say, who we see, and what we do in increasing detail as our physical lives become more and more enmeshed with electronic devices capable of recording our communications, online activities, movements, and even bodily functions. This paper explores the consequences of this digital record for identity, arguing that it presents a challenge to our ability to construct our own personal narratives--narratives that are central to a sense of `self'. In the end, the `right to be forgotten' may be, above all else, a psychological necessity that is core to identity---and therefore a value that we must ensure is protected.",

title="Maximal coverage hybrid search algorithm for deployment in wireless sensor networks",
journal="Wireless Networks",
year="2017",
month="Sep",
day="12",
abstract="A vital design aspect in the setting up of a wireless sensor network is the deployment of sensors. One of the key metrics of the quality of deployment is the coverage as it reflects the monitoring capability of the network. Random deployment is a sub-optimal method as it causes unbalanced deployment and requires sensors in excess of the planned deployment to achieve the same level of coverage. To achieve maximum coverage with a limited number of sensors, planned deployment is a preferred choice. Maximizing the coverage of the region of interest with a given number and type of sensors is an optimization problem. A novel maximal coverage hybrid search algorithm (MCHSA) is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. The MCHSA is a hybrid search algorithm that achieves the balance between exploration and exploitation by applying the particle swarm optimization as a global search technique and using the Hooke--Jeeves pattern search method to improve the local search. The algorithm starts with a good initial population. The proposed MCHSA has low computational complexity and fast convergence. The performance of the MCHSA is analyzed by performing a comparison with the existing algorithms in the literature, in terms of coverage achieved and number of fitness function evaluations. The paper also discusses the tuning of parameters of the proposed algorithm.",

Integration of multiple services and multiple operator transmissions onto a common shared infrastructure is the solution forward to satisfy the contradictory subscriber and operator requirements and also to derive a future-proof fronthaul to support new techniques like opportunistic, co-operative and cognitive communications. This paper reports the link budget analysis, energy efficiency estimation and electromagnetic radiation calculation for a Multi-Operator Multi-Service Analog Radio over Fiber fronthaul for a small cell configuration. The BER analysis and the link budget analysis are presented for the central base station to remote antenna unit (RAU) link as well as the RAU to user equipment link. The estimated minimum transmission power sufficient to establish and maintain a quality connection suggests the possibility of eliminating the energy consuming power amplifiers in the transceivers and also achieve a reduced electromagnetic pollution in the environment.",

abstract="Knowledge management (KM) is important to the knowledge-intensive construction industry. The diversified and changing nature of works in this field warrants us to stocktake, identify changes, and map out KM research framework for future exploration. The study involves three aspects. First, three stages of KM research in construction were distinguished in terms of the time distribution of 217 target publications. Major topics in the stages were extracted for understanding the changes of research emphasis from evolutionary perspective. Second, the past works were summed up in a three-dimensional research framework in terms of management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective. Finally, potential research orientations in the future were predicted to expand the existing research framework. It was found that (1) KM research has significantly blossomed in the last two decades with a great potential; (2) major topics of KM were changing in terms of technology, technique, organization, attribute of knowledge, and research objectives; (3) past KM studies centred around management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective, thus a three-dimensional research framework was proposed; (4) within the research framework, team-level, project-level, and firm-level KM were studied to achieve project, organizational, and competitive objectives by integrated methodologies of information technology, social technique, and KM process tool; and (5) nine potential research orientations were predicted corresponding to the three dimensions. Finally, an expanded research framework was proposed to encourage and guide future research works in this field. The paper only focused on the construction industry. The findings need further exploration in order to discover any possible missing important research works which were not published in English or not included in the time period. The paper formed a systematic framework of KM research in construction and predicted the potential research orientations. It provides much value for the researchers who want to understand the past and the future of global KM research in the construction industry.",

Due to increase in the usage of internet and number of mobile users, many companies use these channels to make their products and brands visible to their customers all over the world. Although, some progress has been made towards this direction but further exploration is required, particularly it is still a challenge to enhance in-flight passengers' shopping experience through efficient and reliable communication protocols. In this paper, we proposed a framework for omni-channel which is based on cognitive radio and machine learning. The proposed cognitive radio communication protocols provide seamless connectivity to in-flight passengers through energy efficient mode like machine learning (ML). Here, machine learning helps to develop user profile, based on relevance feedback that address the problem of catalogue and information overload. In this paper, we also discuss various challenges and opportunities associated with the proposed omni-channel business model. Moreover, the role and impact of emerging technologies such as cognitive radio and 5G in realizing omni-channel businesses is discussed in this paper. Our results explain the seamless communication between aircraft users and merchandise, through reliable and efficient connectivity when the aircraft passes over different geographic areas i.e. urban/rural land or sea at different altitudes and geographic locations. Here, backup data channel is introduced which further enhance the reliability of connection especially when primary users turns ON during the communication. Furthermore, the proposed model helps to reduce communication time and consume less energy to transmit with high throughput as compared to the benchmark cognitive radio protocols.",

abstract="The purpose of this research is to remove barriers hindering radio frequency identification (RFID) adoption/diffusion in industries, and help firms develop effective supply chain management (SCM) practices utilizing RFID, by elucidating the specific mechanisms through which RFID influences supply chain performance (SCP). On the basis of the technology-organization-environment framework, this research examines the technological characteristics and practical context of RFID usage in our theoretical model. It investigates how RFID utilization contributes to supply chain information sharing (SCIS) and, in turn, how SCIS influences SCP. The supply chain culture of competitiveness (SCCC) is proposed as a moderator of the links between RFID utilization and SCIS, and between SCIS and SCP. RFID utilization enhances SCP through the mediating effect of SCIS. The SCCC moderates the effect of RFID utilization on SCIS and directly contributes to SCP. RFID utilization can be an alternative to supplement market competitiveness. Nevertheless, from a long-term perspective, supply chains should develop an SCM strategy, oriented toward learning, innovativeness and entrepreneurship, for the enormous impacts of SCCC on SCP. On the basis of the resource-based view, we focus on the notion of the SCCC instead of individual firm characteristics to operationalize organizational characteristics.",

This study sets up a new evaluation model for agri-product supply chain competitiveness using extension theory to solve this defect and amend the evaluation parameters according to current developments in society and economy. A new evaluation index system for agri-product supply chain is established by considering the new indices needed, such as traceability rate. The study also establishes an accurate evaluation model with extension theory. By analyzing and comparing the results of the instance evaluation models based on extension theory and those of the fuzzy comprehensive methods, we obtained evaluation grades 7 and 6 and a similar level of fluctuation, thereby confirming the validity of the newly established evaluation model based on extension theory.",

abstract="With the wide use of EDGEs (electronic data gathering equipments) such as sensors and RFID (radio frequency identification) devices, unprecedented volumes of event streams have been generated. Mining frequent episodes within the latest time windows over event streams plays a significant role in event monitoring. It helps to generate episode rules, which can reflect the latest change, and predict future events effectively. The paper proposes how to mine MinEpi (minimal occurrence based frequent episode) within the latest time windows. The existing MinEpi mining methods are all Apriori-like, which need to scan data time after time and generate quantities of candidate episodes. This results in high time and space cost. Moreover, Apriori-like methods cannot be applied to event streams. For these problems, the paper proposes the episode matrix and frequent episode tree based mining method (EM{\&}FET), which can generate frequent 2-episodes by constructing an episode matrix and generate higher-level frequent episodes directly by extending lower-level ones gradually, only scanning data once without candidate generation. Moreover, the paper further improves EM{\&}FET, which enhances efficiency and saves space greatly. The experiments on different types of real data sets show the effectiveness and high efficiency of EM{\&}FET and its improvement.",

In this way, the use case operators are able to introduce new rules and parameters that will be taken into account in the analysis and decision-making tasks. Due these characteristics, the orchestration of its analytical functions poses an important challenge in terms of configurability, synchronization and management of resources. In order to contribute to their resolution, this paper aims to lay the groundwork for implement the design and specification of the SELFNET Analyzer orchestration. To this end, several key issues related with the internal coordination of the analytics are introduced, among them initial assumptions, design principles, limitations, partitioning of the analysis process, data persistency and optimization.

In our environment, users can retrieve digital content and data, check the authoring privileges that can be executed on the component resources to generate composite and aggregated contents, and verify the situations in which the composition can hide some privileges that exist in the original contents. When the user holds the privileges for the composition, a license can be automatically generated for the composite content that preserves the rights the user/group holds on the components.

Choi et al.'s scheme is under the off-line password guessing attack and the user impersonation attack without user anonymity. We present an improved authentication scheme and prove it to be secure with the formal security model. Also, we analyze the concrete secure characters and the performance of our scheme. Through comparison with some recent schemes, our scheme is more practical and fit for applications.",

abstract="Mobile context-aware applications execute in the background of hosts mobile devices. The applications source process and aggregate hosts' contextual and personal information. This information is disclosed to ubiquitously pervasive services that adapt their offerings to individual preferences. Unfortunately, many developers continue to ignore the user perspective in context-aware application designs as they complicate their overall task and generate exponential requirements. The additional incorporation of privacy mechanisms in context-aware applications to safeguard context and personal information disclosures also complicates users' tasks resulting to misconfigured or completely abandoned applications. Misconfigured applications give end-users a false assurance of privacy exposing them to comprising services. We present a usability study on Mobile Electronic Personality Version 2 a privacy enhanced context-aware mobile application for personalising ubiquitous services and adapting pervasive smart-spaces. We draw conclusions on key issues related to user needs, based on user interviews, surveys, prototypes and field evaluations. Users' needs are evaluated against five themes, learn-ability, efficiency, memorability, errors, satisfaction and privacy contention. In addition, design layout preferences, privacy manageability and consensus design comprehension are also evaluated. Clarity of priorities in context-aware mobile applications shaped by usability studies effectively increases the acceptance of levels of potential users.",

abstract="A smart city can utilize information and communication technologies to minimize energy, waste, and resource consumption and attain high-efficiency services, so it directly improves the life quality of all residents. However, it also brings about some security and privacy challenges. For instance, once the ubiquitous network in the smart city is attacked, all of the sensitive information and residents' identities will be revealed. In many application scenarios, the anonymity of residents is a desirable security property. After all, nobody wants to be traced for his daily activity or personal habits. In this paper, we propose a generic identity-based broadcast encryption scheme which can satisfy information's confidentiality and users' anonymity simultaneously under chosen-ciphertext attacks. What is different from our previous work which was published in ACISP 2016 is that we present the proof of confidentiality and focus on the application environment. The generic IBBE construction has a desirable property that its public parameter size and private key size are constant as well as its decryption cost is independent of the number of receivers. Thus, no matter from which point of views, the construction is very appropriate for smart city information system.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are augmented with sensing and communication technologies to support elderly people with personalized, adaptive and anticipatory requirements. A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environment's functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment. To deal with these issues, we introduce a contExt Aware web Service dEscription Language (wEASEL) that is an abstract service model to represent services and user tasks in AAL environments. Also, we present a set of wEASEL-based service matching algorithms and evaluate them for their suitability. The proposed service matchmaking mechanism can incorporate services that are available in local AAL environment as well as in the cloud computing marketplace.",

Proposed architecture is well suited for surveillance of critical infrastructures and it is designed to be scalable for various different scenarios. Low power consumption will be achieved by utilizing a wake-up radio concept which enables to keep the most power consuming devices at the sleep mode as long as possible. A WSN OpenAPI gateway (WOAG) component of the architecture supports high scalability by enabling data collection and sharing from networks deployed using multiple different technologies. WOAG facilitates WSNs information availability to local and remote end-users. Analytical energy efficiency optimization model for the architecture is developed. Results show energy efficiency gains that can be achieved with the proposed wake-up concept based intelligent hierarchical architecture design. For low event frequency case the energy efficiency is found to be one order of magnitude better than for duty cycle (1 {\%}) radio based network.",

abstract="Big data has many divergent types of sources, from physical (sensor/IoT) to social and cyber (web) types, rendering it messy and, imprecise, and incomplete. Due to its quantitative (volume and velocity) and qualitative (variety) challenges, big data to the users resembles something like ``the elephant to the blind men''. It is imperative to enact a major paradigm shift in data mining and learning tools so that information from diversified sources must be integrated together to unravel information hidden in the massive and messy big data, so that, metaphorically speaking, it would let the blind men ``see'' the elephant. This talk will address yet another vital ``V''-paradigm: ``Visualization''. Visualization tools are meant to supplement (instead of replace) the domain expertise (e.g. a cardiologist) and provide a big picture to help users formulate critical questions and subsequently postulate heuristic and insightful answers. For big data, the curse of high feature dimensionality is causing grave concerns on computational complexity and over-training. In this talk, we shall explore various projection methods for dimension reduction - a prelude to visualization of vectorial and non-vectorial data. A popular visualization tool for unsupervised learning is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA aims at the best recoverability of the original data in the Euclidean Vector Space (EVS). However, PCA is not effective for supervised and collaborative learning environment. Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA), basically a supervised PCA, can be derived via a notion of Canonical Vector Space (CVS). The signal subspace components of DCA are associated with the discriminant distance/power (related to the classification effectiveness) while the noise subspace components of DCA are tightly coupled with the recoverability and/or privacy protection. DCA enjoys two major merits: First, because the rank of the signal subspace is limited by the number of classes, DCA can effectively support classification using a relatively small dimensionality (i.e. high compression). Second, in DCA, the eigenvalues of the noise-space are ordered according to their corresponding reconstruction errors and can thus be used to control recoverability or anti-recoverability by applying respectively an negative or positive ridge. Via DCA, individual data can be highly compressed before being uploaded to the cloud, and thus better enabling privacy protection. In many practical scenarios, additional privacy protection can be incorporated by allowing individual participants to selectively hide some personal features. The classification of masked data calls for a kernel approach to Incomplete Data Analysis (KAIDA). More specifically, we extend PCA/DCA to their kernel variants. The success of kernel machines hinges upon the kernel function adopted to characterize the similarity of pairs of partially-specified vectors. Simulations on the HAR dataset confirm that DCA far outperforms PCA, both in their conventional or kernelized variants. For the latter, the visualization/classification results suggest favorable performance by the proposed partial correlation kernels over the imputed RBF kernel. In addition, the visualization results further points to a potentially promising approach via multiple kernels such as combining an imputed Gaussian RBF kernel and a non-imputed partial correlation kernel.",

In this paper, a new reversible information hiding scheme is proposed which supports the direct operation in homomorphic encrypted domain. The proposed ``Joint Hiding and Tracing, JHT'' tactics and the ``3 Level Integrity Authentication Scheme'' devote to piracy tracing and integrity authentication. To enhance security, the Paillier homomorphic encryption and Arnold technology are employed. Furthermore, we present the dual region division tactics including Data/Signature region division and Texture/Smooth region division. Data/Signature region division is to circumvent conflicts, and Texture/Smooth region division is fit well with the human visual characteristics. Besides, neighboring quadratic optimization approach is presented to eliminate the smooth/texture isolated islands in the texture/smooth regions. In addition, Extended Integer Transform and position image are developed to achieve reversibility and circumvent overflow/underflow problems. Experimental results confirm the efficient of the proposed scheme, and demonstrate it not only realizes privacy protection, integrity authentication and piracy tracing, but also holds the characteristics of higher security, larger capacity and better restoration quality.",

abstract="The concepts and designs of 4WARD project for the Future Internet involve a clean-slate architecture with various networking innovations, including a new connectivity paradigm called Generic Path (GP). In GP architecture, several facilities are designed to efficiently support complex value-added applications and services with assured Quality of Service (QoS). The GP mainly makes transparent the underlying network structure and heterogeneity, and any entities, regardless of their purpose (technology, location or architectural layer) communicate with each other in a single way via a common interface. In addition, cooperation with network-layer provisioning mechanisms is required to map data paths that are compliant with session-demanded resources (QoS requirements - minimum bandwidth and maximum delay/loss experience) in appropriate GPs. In contrast, robust and scalable QoS-provisioning facilities are urgently required as a support for efficient GP allocations. To address this need, this paper introduces the QoS-Routing and Resource Control (QoS-RRC), a set of GP-compliant facilities to meet the requirements mentioned above. QoS-RRC complements GP architecture with QoS-oriented routing, with the aid of load balancing to select paths that comply with session-demands while keeping residual bandwidth to increase user experience. To address scalability issues, QoS-RRC operates on the basis of an overprovisioning-centric approach to achieve cost-effectiveness in terms of state storage, signaling load and network operations. An initial QoS-RRC performance evaluation was carried out in Network Simulator v.2 (NS-2), which showed that there had been drastic improvements in the flow delay experience and bandwidth use among a range of relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, the impact of QoS-RRC on the user experience (compared to current IP QoS and routing standards) has been evaluated, by analyzing the main objective and subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, namely Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Video Quality Metric (VQM) and Mean Opinion Score (MOS).",

To maximize the system throughput of the network, a channel access mechanism based on evolutionary game is proposed. Under the mechanism, users are assumed to be bounded rationality, in order to coordinate users' behavior in distributed manner, a new reward function is deduced. On the basis of the reward function, a dynamic channel access algorithm and corresponding dynamic equation are designed for the mechanism, which converge to Nash Equilibrium with faster speed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the reward function proposed can realize the maximization of system throughput and higher normalized utilities of users under the framework of evolutionary game, and the corresponding dynamic equation is globally asymptotically stable, besides, when user deviates because of bounded rationality, the dynamic equation is still able to guarantee faster convergence and smaller performance deviation.",

We discuss the factors that affect the system dependability and the studies conducted to improve it with respect to these factors. These studies were categorized according to their similarities and differences in hope of shedding some insight into future research. There are three categories: context management, fault detection, and uncertainty handling. These three categories of work address the three most difficult problems of pervasive computing systems. First, pervasive computing systems' perceived environments, which are also called their contexts, can vary intensively, and thus have a great impact on the systems' dependability. Second, it is challenging to guarantee the correctness of the systems' internal computations integrated with interactions with external environments for developers. Fault detection is then an important issue for improving dependability for these systems. Last but not least importantly, pervasive computing systems interact with their environments frequently. These interactions can be affected by many uncertainties, which can jeopardize the systems' dependability. After a discussion of these pieces of work, we present an outlook for its future research directions.",

Tools and methodologies to study the performance of such systems are constantly sought and become fundamental in the feasibility assessment of the high number of possible applications. In this paper, a simulation tool is proposed to study the performance of a particular kind of Wireless Mesh Network, based on the RF-Mesh technology. The modular nature of the implemented tool allows for a smooth extension to the performance analysis of other types of Wireless Mesh Networks using technologies similar to RF-Mesh. The tool was implemented in the context of a large-scale Smart Grid AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) system. The tool, coded in Java and Python, considers different types of traffic and provides the end-to-end delay and several other performance indexes of large scale (i.e., with several thousand nodes) instances in the order of minutes. A realistic large-scale case study of a smart city is also presented to assess the suitability of the RF-Mesh technology for some IoT and smart city applications, that do not require a very small delay.",

abstract="In future smart-cities, public transportation vehicles are planned to serve as data couriers (DCs) in order to exchange massive amounts of data chunks. In this research, we study the path planning problem for these DCs while optimizing their counts and their total traveled distances. As the total collected load on a given DC route cannot exceed its storage capacity, it is important to decide on the size of the exchanged data-packets (images, videos, etc.) and the sequence of the targeted data sources to be visited. We propose a hybrid heuristic approach for public data delivery in smart-city settings. In this approach, public vehicles are utilized as DCs that read/collect data from numerously distributed Access Points (APs) and relay it back to a central processing base-station in the city. We also introduce a cost-based fitness function for DCs election in the smart-city paradigm. Our cost-based function considers resource limitations in terms of DCs count, storage capacity, and energy consumption. Extensive simulations are performed, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to other heuristic approaches with respect to total traveled distances and overall time complexity.",

abstract="The management and implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems has tended to concentrate on their transactional and record-keeping aspects, rather than on their decision-support capabilities. As ERP systems have evolved, they have become increasingly important as a way of leveraging transaction data for building decision support and analytics applications. This paper explores connections between ERP systems and decision support based on the perceptions of 53 ERP system adopters. The notion of the ``perceived success'' of enterprise systems for the decision support function is broken down further into four dimensions: decision support for individuals, for decision participants working jointly, for inter-related decisions, and for decisions involving multiple organizations. This study offers new insights into the important relationship between the perceived success of the ERP system and its role as a foundation for more advanced decision support applications.",

abstract="Reliability is a key concern when distributed context-aware applications assist end-users in intelligent environments. As these adaptive applications are never deployed in isolation, delivering failsafe behavior is a non-trivial challenge. Indeed, they usually operate well in the cool comfort of a lab environment, but may not behave as expected in the real world due to unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, intelligent environments continuously evolve as end-users install and interconnect new sensors, actuators or other appliances. These observations make it challenging for software engineers to design, develop and deploy context-aware distributed applications that guarantee fault-tolerant behavior under all possible situations. In this work, we advocate a `Design for Failure' approach to build applications that are expected to handle faults gracefully. We use enhanced software circuit breakers for distributed context-aware applications to deliver fault-tolerant intelligent environments.

The secure multiparty computation (SMC)-based privacy-preserving data mining has emerged as a solution to this problem. However, there is heavy computation cost at user side in traditional SMC solutions. This study introduces an outsourcing method to reduce the computation cost of the user side. We also preserve the privacy of the shared databy proposing an outsourced privacy-preserving C4.5 algorithm over horizontally and vertically partitioned data for multiple parties based on the outsourced privacy preserving weighted average protocol (OPPWAP) and outsourced secure set intersection protocol (OSSIP). Consequently, we have found that our method can achieve a result same the original C4.5 decision tree algorithm while preserving data privacy. Furthermore, we also implement the proposed protocols and the algorithms. It shows that a sublinear relationship exists between the computational cost of the user side and the number of participating parties.",

abstract="Context-aware security utilizes external data, such as time of the day or user information, to improve its capability of detecting a security breach. In this paper we present a Context-aware security framework based on a Traffic Anomaly Detection Indicator (TADI) which indicates when a threat can occur. The main novelty of our approach is that we use as a context the time-based information derived from profile analysis of a typical day to determine more accurately the presence of an anomaly based on the time of day it occurs. This 24-h typical daily analysis helps us to consider the time interval (night-time, working hours, etc.) in which a potential threat occurs, in contrast to traditional sudden peak changes. First, a preliminary analysis based on historical data shows how traffic typically behaves at each particular period of the day. We subsequently calibrate our procedure by checking the effectiveness of different algorithms so that we are aware of which ones gets better performance in each period of the day. Finally the TADI is calculated from the time-based contextual information. We also present the results based on actual traffic traces collected from a campus university that show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

abstract="The incorporation of electronics by embedding the relevant sensors in the physical devices in home and office, vehicles of all types, buildings in the smart cities and in all possible spheres of life form a network of devices termed as internet of things (IoT). It is being realized that vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) which are responsible for the reliable and secure communication among vehicles is a primary area of research in IoT and hence ensuring security in this area is essential. Thus, this work introduces a novel approach to improve the existing authentication support to VANETs. In this proposed framework, first an anonymous authentication approach for preserving the privacy is proposed which not only performs the vehicle user's anonymous authentication but preserves the message integrity of the transmitting messages as well. Although many anonymous authentication schemes have been proposed in VANETs until now, the existing schemes suffer from a high computation cost during the signature and certificate verification process which leads to delayed authentication. Consequently, the vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) cannot authenticate more number of vehicles per second in VANETs. Second, an efficient anonymous group key distribution protocol is proposed in this paper for securely distributing the group key to the group of vehicles in the communication range of an RSU. The RSUs can send location based information to the group of vehicles in a secure manner using this group key. Experimental analysis portrays that the results of this new privacy preserving anonymous authentication and key management schemes are promising and efficient with regard to signature verification cost and computational cost in comparison with the existing schemes.",

abstract="Smart city has been greatly promoted by the adoption of information and communication technology. At the same time, data integrity becomes an urgent necessity in cloud storage scenario. When smart city meets cloud, if the data are damaged or corrupted, it will be a serious security loophole of smart city. Recently, numerous remote data auditing (RDA) protocols have been presented, among which Sookhak et al. put forward a dynamic remote data auditing protocol to deal with this major concern. In this paper, we found that this protocol has inherent security flaws, thus fails to achieve its original goal. Specifically, this protocol is vulnerable to two types of attacks, namely replace attack and replay attack. We show the details that how a malicious server can deceive data owners to believe that the data are maintained well by launching such attacks. Then, we describe an improved RDA protocol with provable security by utilizing algebraic signature to fix those security flaws. We employ the rank-based Merkle Hash Tree to achieve verifiable dynamic data operations for our RDA protocol. We also provide detailed security proof of the proposed RDA protocol.",

X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed the formation of pure ZnO and PANI--ZnO composites. Field emission scanning electron micrographs revealed the leaf like structure of ZnO, porous nature of PANI and the uniformly distributed blend of these two structures for the composite films.

We firstly investigate the relationship between the lower and upper approximation operators based on a pair of ordinary implications and special fuzzy relations. And then (I, J)-fuzzy rough operators based on some special fuzzy relations are characterized by single axioms, which ensure the existence of polytypic fuzzy relations generating the same (I, J)-fuzzy rough approximation operators.",

Meanwhile, considering a company owned the internal BDI and the external BDI, the market demand function was revised and four decision models were proposed from a new perspective. Then, the effects of BDI investment on supply chain members' benefits under the four models were analyzed and an effectively coordination tactic was presented for achieving supply chain coordination. Results indicated when the investment cost could face a certain threshold, the retailer or the manufacturer investing in BDI could increase its benefits. Meanwhile, there existed ``positive externalities'' for other supply chain members. In addition, after supply chain members investing in BDI together, revenue-sharing contract could coordinate the supply chain effectively. This article provided a theoretical guidance or a decision basis for companies investing in BDI, meanwhile, it had reference values for supply chain coordination after investing in BDI.",

Even the most intimate ones are becoming mediated by devices such as teledildonics which digitally provide a tactual stimulation allowing users to have sexual intercourse through them. The efforts made in order to provide such an intertwinement of our everyday lives and digital technologies are evident, but the effects produced by them are not clear at all.

abstract="Piezoresistive acceleration sensors have found a wide range of applications for the last four decades. However, in recent times, high performance piezoresistive acceleration sensors with lower footprint are in demand, especially in the fields of consumer electronics and biomedical engineering. The design of such sensors remains a challenging task due to the competing requirements of high electrical sensitivity (∆R/R) and resonant frequency (f                                          0                ) along with low device footprint. In this paper, we elaborate the design and optimization of a highly miniaturized doubly clamped acceleration sensor with an integrated silicon nanowire as a piezoresistor. The diminutive size of the silicon nanowire helps in reducing the device foot print. The design is performed using two methods: (1) electrical approach and (2) mechanical approach. In the electrical approach, the conventional bulk silicon diffused piezoresistors are replaced with a silicon nanowire without changing the dimensions of the original structure. It is shown that compared to the conventional design, a silicon nanowire based sensor exhibits 2.51 times better performance in terms of electrical sensitivity. One of the major constraints with miniaturized high performance acceleration sensors is reduced resonant frequency. Therefore, in the mechanical approach we have devised a geometrical optimization technique to miniaturize the sensor geometry by keeping its resonant frequency constant. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the proposed miniaturized sensor with an integrated silicon nanowire as the piezoresistor. The sensor performance is evaluated with a new performance factor given as                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}left( {\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}Delta R{\}} {\backslash}mathord{\{}{\backslash}left/ {\{}{\backslash}vphantom {\{}{\{}{\backslash}Delta R{\}} R{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right. {\backslash}kern-0pt{\}} R{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right)f{\_}{\{}0{\}}^{\{}2{\}} {\}} {\backslash}mathord{\{}{\backslash}left/ {\{}{\backslash}vphantom {\{}{\{}{\backslash}left( {\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}Delta R{\}} {\backslash}mathord{\{}{\backslash}left/ {\{}{\backslash}vphantom {\{}{\{}{\backslash}Delta R{\}} R{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right. {\backslash}kern-0pt{\}} R{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right)f{\_}{\{}0{\}}^{\{}2{\}} {\}} {\{}Diesize{\}}{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right. {\backslash}kern-0pt{\}} {\{}Diesize{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                                                                                                                                        $\Delta$                                R                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          R                                                                                                            f                                                          0                                                        2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              D                          i                          e                          s                          i                          z                          e                                                                                                    , which takes into account the electrical sensitivity, the resonant frequency and the die size of the sensor.

abstract="Efficiency of cantilever based continuous piezoelectric energy harvester is reduced by charge cancellation due to changes of mechanical strain in higher vibration modes. Therefore, in order to prevent the charge cancellation, various segmentation techniques are adopted at respective strain nodes of higher modes. In this paper, two distributed parameter models are developed for the traditional segment techniques of the cantilever with tip mass configuration in `n' number of strain nodes. The electrodes of piezoelectric layer are segmented in 1st model whereas piezoelectric layer along with electrodes are segmented in 2nd model. In both the models, the bimorph segmented electrodes are connected parallel with external resistive loads. The analytical solutions of electrical frequency response under harmonic base excitations are obtained through Euler--Bernoulli beam theory for 1st model and extended Hamilton beam assumptions for 2nd model. The developed analytical models are validated using numerical models established by COMSOL. The results demonstrate that the performance of proposed segmented piezoelectric layer model outperforms than traditional model of segmented electrode piezoelectric energy harvester.",

abstract="With the rapid development of network, big data has become an important research field for many areas such as data mining, machine learning, information diffusion, the internet of things, and social networks. The multimedia information spreads faster since the rise of social network where people can create and share images, video and audio contents. More and more people share and comment on the web through the mobile terminal to express their mends. Online content captures online behavior of users who communicate or interact on a diversity of issues and topics. How to predict the popularity of the online content happened recently is a hot topic and lots of people are trying to find out the law of information diffusion hidden in it. However, many models assume that information spreads with no external interference in social networks. The research on competitive diffusion is still at the primary stage. The main contribution of this paper is to solve the problem that there are few or no work for popularity prediction based on multi-information, and propose a model based on competitive matrix with a cluster-based news classification approach. The goal of this paper is to accurately estimate the popularity of a given viral topic at final based on the observation of its historical characteristics. And this model is mainly based on the competitive matrix and gradient descent method. Also, the capability of this method provides a better performance in the popularity prediction according to an empirical study.",

abstract="The characteristics of a new type of electrostatic energy harvesting device, called an out-of-plane overlap harvester, are analyzed for the first time. This device utilizes a movable part that vibrates up and down on the surface of a wafer and a changing overlapping area between the vertical comb fingers. This operational principle enables the minimum capacitance to be close to 0 and significantly increases the energy conversion efficiency per unit volume. The characteristics of the out-of-plane overlap harvester, an in-plane gap-closing harvester, and an in-plane overlap harvester are compared in terms of the length, height, and width of the comb finger and the parasitic capacitance. The efficiency is improved as the length or the height increases and as the width or the parasitic capacitance decreases. In every case, the out-of-plane overlap harvester is able to create more energy and is, thus, preferable over other designs. It is also free from collisions between two electrodes caused by random vibration amplitudes and creates more energy from offaxis perturbations. This device, given its small feature size, is expected to provide more energy to various types of wireless electronics devices and to offer high compatibility with other integrated circuits and ease of embedment.",

The purpose of this study lies in recommending and proposing P2P context awareness based sensibility design using color and bio-signal analysis. In order to express design that coincides with distinctive and differentiated sensibility of people, the proposed method analyzes relation between visual sensibility and color design with the use of statistic analysis tool R 3.1.0 and SPSS 21.0 and the clustering of users with similar sensibility is conducted with the use of P2P network based context awareness. It recommends color design that coincides with the sensibility of new user by using the P2P network based collaborative filtering and applying it to color design based on clustered users.

This theory is of great importance in sociology, computer science, psychology and other disciplines where social systems can be represented as signed networks. The social balance problem is hard but very interesting. It has attracted many researchers from various fields working on it over the past few years. Many significant theories and approaches have been developed and now exhibit tremendous potential for future applications. A comprehensive review of these existing studies can provide us significant insights into understanding the dynamic patterns of social systems. Yet to our investigation, existing studies have not done this, especially from a dynamical perspective. In this paper, we make an attempt towards conducting a brief survey of these scientific activities on social balance. Our efforts aim to review what has been done so far in this evolving area. We firstly introduce the fundamental concepts and significant properties of social balance. Then we summarize the existing balance measures and present detecting/partitioning algorithms, as well as important empirical investigations in both physical world and cyberspace. We next mainly focus on describing and comparing the fundamental mechanisms of the dynamics models. Several existing problems not yet satisfactorily solved in this area are also discussed.",

This paper presents architecture of smart shop floor based on physical, logical, and communication layers that embed intelligent approaches within manufacturing processes. Every physical entity in the smart shop floor is regarded as an autonomous intelligent logical unit that performs operations guided by distributed control functions. Moreover, computing power and optimization approaches are embedded into each logical unit to make decisions to agilely respond to frequent occurrence of unexpected disturbances at the shop floor. A test platform has been set up to demonstrate how physical entities can be cooperative and autonomous logical units that can automatize the shop floor operations.

abstract="Integrated multilayered triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are an efficient approach to solve the insufficient energy problem caused by a single-layered TENG for achieving high output power density. However, most integrated multilayered TENGs have a relatively large volume. Here, a double-induced-mode integrated triboelectric nanogenerator (DI-TENG) based on spring steel plates is presented as a cost-effective, simple, and high-performance device for ambient vibration energy harvesting. The unique stackable rhombus structure, in which spring steel plates act both as skeletons and as electrodes, can enhance the output performance and maximize space utilization. The DI-TENG with five repeated units in a volume of 12 cm {\texttimes} 5 cm {\texttimes} 0.4 cm can generate a short-circuit current of 51 $\mu$A and can transfer charges of 1.25 $\mu$C in a half period. The contrast experiment is conducted systematically and the results have proved that the DI-TENG has a great advantage over the single-induced-mode TENG (SI-TENG) with only one side of a friction layer on its electrode. Besides, the DI-TENG can easily power a commercial calculator and can be used as a door switch sensor.",

This paper presents the implementation details for detecting telecommunication fraud using Data Stream Analytics and Neural Network classification based Data Mining. For detection using Data Stream Analytics, Event Hub and Stream Analytics components of Microsoft Azure have been used whereas for detection using Data Mining Neural Network Pattern Recognition tool as well as a self-coded algorithm in Matlab has been used. Based on the results, the accuracy of both the techniques have been compared and the situations for selection of a suitable technique based on the user requirements and the flow of data has been narrowed down. The findings can elucidate upon other cloud analytics systems and provide a basis for big data analytics and mining.",

abstract="Induction efficiency is the evaluation index for measuring the induced voltage of a wireless-sensing module, and this index is affected by the electric properties, shape, number, and position of inductances. In this study, indium--tin oxide with a thickness of 30 nm was coated on a glass substrate to fabricate a planar square spiral inductor (PSSI), and patterns were then ablated using a UV laser with a wavelength of 355 nm. Single and array patterns with different dimensions were designed to investigate the variation of induction efficiency. The results indicated that the 3 {\texttimes} 3 PSSI array ablated at a frequency of 100 kHz and that a scanning speed of 1000 mm/s had the highest induction efficiency of 6.4 {\%}, which was 2.4 {\%} higher than that of PSSIs that ablated at other processing parameters. The induction efficiency could be enhanced, but the uniformity of sensing decreased as the array number decreased, and the highest induction efficiency of 10 {\%} and highest variation of 7.2 {\%} were caused by position deviation, which was obtained from a single pattern. In addition, the induction efficiency of 3.2 {\%} was obtained from the 4 {\texttimes} 4 array pattern, and the variation caused by the position was controlled to less than 0.8 {\%}. The results showed the specific relationship among the dimensions, number of patterns, and induction efficiency.

abstract="Recently, mobile social networks (MSN) have gained tremendous attention, which free users from face-to-monitor life, while still can share information and stay in touch with their friends on the go. However most MSN applications regard mobile terminals just as entry points to existing social networks, in which centralized servers (for storage and processing of all application/context data) and continual Internet connectivity are prerequisites for mobile users to exploit MSN services, even though they are within proximity area (like campus, event spot, and community, etc.), and can directly exchange data through various wireless technologies (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, etc.). In this paper, we focus on mobile social networking in proximity (MSNP), which is explicitly defined in our paper as: MSNP is wireless peer-to-peer (P2P) network of spontaneously and opportunistically connected nodes, and uses geo-proximity as the primary filter in determining who is discoverable on the social network. In this paper, first, primary support approaches related to MSNP available in literature, are summarized and compared, including MSN, mobile P2P and opportunistic networks. And then, we offer the special characteristics of MSNP, open issues and potential solutions. A networking technologies and platform independent architecture is proposed for developing MSNP applications, and proof-of-concept implementation of WiFi direct based MSNP application is also provided. Our primary goal is to identify the characteristics, technical challenges and potential solutions for future MSNP applications, capable to flexibly adapt to different application domains and deployment requirements.",

Wireless charging provides an alternative approach to recharge the batteries of the wireless nodes. Localization provides the position information. Previous works have considered either on recharging techniques or on the localization. This paper proposes a wireless recharging and also localization using a single mobile anchor. First the mobile anchor locates the static node later it receives the battery level. Finally if the battery of the static node is lesser than the threshold limit $\beta$, it recharges the static nodes wirelessly. Also the mobile anchor follows an energy efficient path V curve algorithm. The proposed method can handle the dynamic energy demand efficiently.",

abstract="The localization is an important asset in all existing and emerging wireless networking solutions since it can extend the radio environmental awareness and assist in providing better network operation. The received signal strength (RSS) based non-Bayesian transmitter localization is especially interesting due to the inherent presence of the RSS observations in all commercial radio devices and the instantaneous estimations without the need for extensive training/learning phases. The existing RSS based localization solutions neglect the problems arising from the inherent sensing network topology uncertainty. The sensors, usually assumed to have a-priori known positions, are often a subject of a previous estimation which propagates errors in the transmitter localization procedure, and, hence, results in significant transmitter localization performance degradation. This paper presents a recently developed generic RSS based joint transmitter/sensors localization framework, founded on the assumption of uncertain topology information. The derived joint maximum likelihood (JML) algorithm simultaneously estimates the transmitter and uncertain sensor positions providing twofold gains: improving the transmitter localization and reducing the network topology uncertainty. The paper broadly evaluates the JML algorithm, emphasizing the substantial localization gains originating from the joint transmitter/sensor position estimation. The results prove up to 85 {\%} sensor position uncertainty reduction with the general system model with multiple transmitters locations and multiple previous estimations of the sensors positions. The paper also derives the theoretical lower bounds of the joint estimation framework, and proves the convergence of the JML algorithm. The presented joint estimation framework is applicable to a variety of wireless networking applications. It can provide self-awareness in future wireless networks and cope with the environment and topology dynamism in wireless ad-hoc networks.",

Third, we retrieve similar lung nodule images with the presented adaptive-weighted similarity calculation method. Finally, we recognize nodule signs from the retrieval results, which can also provide decision support for diagnosis of lung lesions. The proposed method is validated on the publicly available databases: lung image database consortium and image database resource initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and lung computed tomography (CT) imaging signs (LISS). The experimental results demonstrate our retrieval method substantially improves retrieval performance compared with those using traditional Hamming distance, and the retrieval precision can achieve 87.29{\%} when the length of hash code is 48 bits. The entire recognition rate on the basis of the retrieval results can achieve 93.52{\%}. Moreover, our method is also effective for real-life diagnosis data.",

In formulating the fuzzy objective function we also include the potential impacts of climate change on the energy output of hydroelectric power plants. In addition to formulating and solving the capacity planning/investment problem, we also performed scenario-based (sensitivity) analysis to explore how investment decisions of the GenCos change when fuzziness (tolerance) in the maximum energy output of hydroelectric units and/or drought expectation increases.

abstract="Energy harvesters (EH) are devices that convert environmental energy (i.e. thermal, vibrational or electromagnetic) into electrical energy. One of the most promising solutions consists in transforming energy from vibrations using a piezoelectric material placed onto a mechanical resonator. The intrinsic drawback of this solution is the typically high quality factor of the device which works effectively only within a narrow bandwidth. To overcome this limitation it is possible to tune the mechanical resonance of the device, to introduce non-linear elements (e.g. magnets) or to design the mechanical resonator with a multimodal behaviour. In ultra low power applications the aspect of integration is of utmost importance and so micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based EHs are preferable. Within this scenario the multimodal solution is the more suitable considering the technological constraints imposed by the micromachining manufacturing process. In this paper, we describe the optimization of a given multimodal mechanical geometry in order to maximize the number of resonances within a certain frequency band. The proposed optimization is finite element method (FEM)-based and it uses modal and harmonic simulations for both selecting the useful modes and then designing the device in a way that presents those modes within a predefined frequency range. This mechanical optimization is the first step for maximizing the output power of a multimodal piezoelectric energy harvester. The second step focuses on the optimization of the piezoelectric transducer geometry targeting the resonant modes defined in the first step. The optimization procedure is applied to an array of cantilever used as a case study.",

Therefore, researching on anti-collision algorithms to reduce the collisions and increasing the system efficiency becomes a hotspot. In this paper, we focus on the passive RFID tags and first propose a dynamical frame slotted ALOHA-based estimation method to predict the unknown population of tags. Based on this, an adjustment strategy is proposed to dynamically modify the frame size as the population of tags changes. In this adjustment strategy, a segment fashion is proposed to instead the slot-by-slot fashion; the former one could efficiently increase the reading speed and ensure the system throughput. As a result, the proposed algorithm could reach to the throughput of 35{\%} in average with a stable estimation accuracy of 80{\%}. The simulation shows that our algorithm also outperforms the other algorithms in the identification speed (tags/s).",

Moreover, DNA copy number change is an essential measure to diagnose the cancer disease. Next generation sequencing is an important method for studying the spread of infectious disease qualitatively and quantitatively. CGH is widely used in continuous monitoring of copy number of thousands of genes throughout the genome. In recent years, the size of the DNA sequence data is very large.

In this paper, we use a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian Mixture (GM) Clustering approach to model the DNA copy number change across the genome.

In order to ensure a high-level of accuracy and to meet the real-time requirement, a fast collision detection algorithm between soft bodies is proposed. The developed algorithm is a combination of stochastic methods and particle swarm optimization with adaptive Cauchy mutation. The hierarchical bounding box method is used for a rough detection in order to filter out obvious disjoint space, and the problem is converted to a nonlinear optimization problem based on the distance of points. Then particle swarm optimization with adaptive Cauchy mutation is used to find the optimal solution. When it is updated iteratively, keeping some particles experience value and variation of other particles avoids particles trapped in local optimum, which further accelerates the speed of collision detection. The algorithm is implemented and evaluated through experiments and the results confirm the advantages of the developed algorithm.",

In order to transmit real medical data to practical data center by simulating BSN under semi-physical simulation environment, this paper designs an OPNET packet structure, defines a gateway node model between simulating BSN and practical data center and builds a custom protocol stack. Moreover, this paper conducts a large amount of simulation on the real data transmission through simulation network connecting with practical network. The simulation result can provides a reference for parameter settings of fully practical network and reduces the cost of devices and personnel involved.",

abstract="Vehicle-to-vehicle communication and probabilistic broadcast are important means for information dissemination in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). In contrast to static ad-hoc networks, high-speed mobility makes wireless connection between two vehicles intermittent. Nevertheless, some kinds of information do not rely on continuous connection for transmission. An important fact is that numerous vehicles `desire' to have such information as safety-related data and leisure information. In recent years, an excessive number of protocols have attached themselves to critical information dissemination, and the existing protocols already have excellent performance. People severely neglect leisure information because of its low importance. Even so, the dissemination of leisure information is an important issue in VANET when, for example, people take long trips on highways. Therefore, we propose interest-aware probabilistic dissemination (IAPD) of leisure information in VANET, which combines probabilistic broadcast and timer-based broadcast techniques. We also develop a state transition system for leisure-information dissemination. The simulation results show that IAPD cost less than restriction flooding and simple schemes in obtaining a high reception rate.",

abstract="Nanonetworks consist of nano-sized communicating devices which are able to perform simple tasks at the nanoscale. The limited capabilities of individual nanomachines and the Terahertz (THz) band channel behavior lead to error-prone wireless links. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis of error-control strategies for nanonetworks in the THz band is presented. A mathematical framework is developed and used to analyze the tradeoffs between Bit Error Rate, Packet Error Rate, energy consumption and latency, for five different error-control strategies, namely, Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), Forward Error Correction (FEC), two types of Error Prevention Codes (EPC) and a hybrid EPC. The cross-layer effects between the physical and the link layers as well as the impact of the nanomachine capabilities in both layers are taken into account. At the physical layer, nanomachines are considered to communicate by following a time-spread on-off keying modulation based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. At the link layer, nanomachines are considered to access the channel in an uncoordinated fashion, by leveraging the possibility to interleave pulse-based transmissions from different nodes. Throughout the analysis, accurate path loss, noise and multi-user interference models, validated by means of electromagnetic simulation, are utilized. In addition, the energy consumption and latency introduced by a hardware implementation of each error control technique, as well as, the additional constraints imposed by the use of energy-harvesting mechanisms to power the nanomachines, are taken into account. The results show that, despite their simplicity, EPCs outperform traditional ARQ and FEC schemes, in terms of error correcting capabilities, which results in further energy savings and reduced latency.",

abstract="Activity recognition is an important step towards monitoring and evaluating the functional health of an individual, and it potentially promotes human-centric ubiquitous applications in smart homes particularly for senior healthcare. The nature of human activity characterized by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty, however, poses a great challenge to the design of good feature representations and the optimization of classifiers towards building a robust model for human activity recognition. In this study, we propose to exploit deep learning techniques to automatically learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminative latent patterns inherent in the simple low-level features. Specifically, we extract high-level features with a stacked autoencoder that has a deep and hierarchy architecture, and combine feature learning and classifier construction into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. Besides, we investigate two different original feature representations of the sensor data for latent feature learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available smart home datasets, and compare it with a range of shallow models in terms of time-slice accuracy and class accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better recognition rates and generalizes better across different original feature representations, indicating its applicability to the real-world activity recognition.",

pages="2415--2437",
abstract="Most recent research on object tracking sensor networks has focused on collecting all data from the sensor network into the sink, which delivers the predicted locations to the corresponding nodes in order to accurately predict object movement. The communication cost of this centralized scenario is higher than that of a distributed method. Centralized data collection affects the freshness of the data and increases latency in movement trajectory prediction. In addition, due to the large amount of packets being sent and received, sensor node energy is quickly exhausted. Although this data collection method might result in higher accuracy for prediction, the sensor network lifetime is not reduced. In this paper, a distributed object tracking method is proposed using the network structure of convex polygons, called faces. The nodes in the faces cooperate to find the trajectories of an object and then these trajectories are used to predict the objects' movement. The proposed method, based on trajectory tree construction, can reduce both the storage space of collected trajectories and the time spent on trajectory prediction analysis. Simulations show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption of the nodes and make prediction of nodes moving direction accurately than the existing approaches.",

abstract="Mobile crowd-sensing applications produce useful knowledge of the surrounding environment, which makes our life more predictable. However, these applications often require users to contribute, consciously or unconsciously, location-related data for analysis, which gravely encroaches users' location privacy. Aggregate processing is a feasible way for preserving user privacy to some extent, and based on the mode, some privacy-preserving schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes still cannot guarantee users' location privacy in the scenarios with low density participants. Meanwhile, user accountability also needs to be considered comprehensively to protect the system against malicious users. In this paper, we propose data aggregate statistics schemes with participant density-independent location privacy-protection for mobile crowd-sensing applications. First, we make use of multi-pseudonym mechanism to overcome the vulnerability due to low participant density. Then, to further handle sybil attacks, we propose two schemes based on the Paillier cryptosystem. In the basic scheme, we leverage non-interactive zero-knowledge proof technology to verify users' sensing data. In the advanced scheme, we present a novel verification framework, which also addresses the problem of user accountability, but at the cost of introducing a new entity. Finally, the theoretical analysis indicates that our scheme achieves the desired properties, and the performance experiments demonstrate that our scheme can achieve a balance among accuracy, privacy-protection and computational overhead.",

abstract="Mobile crowd-sensing can learn the aggregate statistics over personal data to produce useful knowledge about the world. Since personal data may be privacy-sensitive, the aggregator should only gain desired statistics without learning anything about the personal data. To guarantee differential privacy of personal data under an untrusted aggregator, existing approaches encrypt the noisy personal data, and allow the aggregator to get a noisy sum. However, these approaches lack of either efficient support of dynamic joins and leaves, or secure data-integrity verification, or fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose a novel private data aggregation scheme to address these issues for mobile crowd-sensing applications. In our scheme, we first design an efficient group management protocol to deal with the participants' dynamic joins and leaves. Then we enhance the scheme with data-integrity verification by considering the security vulnerability of limited data range. Moreover, we guarantee fault tolerance by leveraging a future message buffering mechanism, enabling continuously obtaining aggregate results and integrity verifications when failures happen. The analysis indicates that our scheme achieves desired properties, and the performance evaluation demonstrates the scheme's efficiency in terms of communication and computation overhead.",

Usually, clustering method helps the network in the minimum utilization of energy that results in enhancing network lifetime. Moreover, various nodes in the multi-hop network that are near to the base station drain their battery very quickly thus lead to creating hot spot problem in a network. To overcome such constraints, this paper proposes a multilayer clustering architecture for selection of forwarding node, rotation of cluster head, and inter and intra-cluster routing communication. The proposed scheme efficiently tackle the rotation of forwarder node by incorporating routing table (table list) at each node. Moreover, the rotation is performed by the consideration of two threshold levels of the residual energy of a node. Also, the exploitation of decision maker node, forwarder node, backup forwarder node, and non-forwarder node enhancing the routing strategy in a network. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested and evaluated by C programming language.

abstract="Nowadays, big media healthcare data processing in cloud has become an effective solution for satisfying QoS demands of medical users. It can support various healthcare services such as pre-processing, storing, sharing, and analysis of monitored data as well as acquiring context-awareness. However, to support energy and cost savings, the union of cloud data centers termed as cloud confederation can be an promising approach, which helps a cloud provider to overcome the limitation of physical resources. However, the key challenge in it is to achieve multiple contradictory objectives, e.g., meeting the required level of services defined in service level agreement, maintaining medial users'application QoS, etc. while maximizing profit of a cloud provider. In this paper, for executing heterogeneous big healthcare data processing requests from users, we develop a local and global cloud confederation model, namely FnF, that makes an optimal selection decision for target cloud data center(s) by exploiting Fuzzy logic. The FnF trades off in between profit of cloud provider and user application QoS in selecting federated data center(s). In addition, FnF enhances its decision accuracy by precisely estimating the resource requirements for the big data processing tasks using multiple linear regression. The proposed FnF model is validated through numerical as well as experimental evaluations. Simulation results depict the effectiveness and efficiency of the FnF model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

abstract="Frame slotted ALOHA protocol as a key technology to improve system throughput has been widely applied to modern radio frequency identification systems. In this paper, a novel frame slotted ALOHA collision arbitration protocol based on code division multiple access has been proposed. The main aim of the proposed algorithm is to avoid collisions between multiple tags. In the scheme, an orthogonal sequence is used as the means to distinguish the transmitted data from different tags within the same time slot and frequency band. The theoretical analysis and simulation results proved that the performance of our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing ALOHA-based protocols.",

abstract="There has been significant interest in the use of HTTP adaptive streaming for live or on-demand video over the Internet in recent years. To mitigate the streaming transmission delay and reduce the networking overhead, an effective and critical approach is to utilize cache services between the origin servers and the heterogeneous clients. As the underlying protocol for web transactions, HTTP has great potentials to explore the resources within state-of-the-art CDNs for caching; yet distinct challenges arise in the HTTP adaptive streaming context. After examining a long-term and large-scale adaptive streaming dataset as well as statistical analysis, we demonstrate that the switching requests among the different qualities frequently emerge and constitute a significant portion in a per-day view. Consequently, they have substantially affected the performance of cache servers and Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of viewers. In this paper, we propose a novel cache model that captures the dependency among the segments in the cache server for adaptive HTTP streaming. Our work does not assume any specific selection algorithm on the client's side and hence can be easily incorporated into existing streaming cache systems. Its centralized nature is also well accommodated by the latest DASH specification. Moreover, we extend our work to the multi-server caching context and present a similarity-aware allocation mechanism to enhance the caching efficiency. The performance evaluation shows our dependency- and similarity-aware strategy can significantly improve the cache hit-ratio and QoE of HTTP streaming as compared to previous approaches.",

abstract="Owing to advances in N-screen technologies that support screen switching among multiple internet-enabled smart devices, people now can use their devices to watch contents even while they are moving. However, current N-screen technologies require human intervention for switching between screens of multiple devices. To overcome this restriction, we propose a seamless screen switching scheme in which screen switching can occur without any user intervention by making use of context information collected from smart devices with embedded sensors to understand local contexts surrounding the user. Our scheme makes it possible to accurately detect the user's contexts through the sensors to predict a specific smart device at which the user is about to arrive, and to provide seamless screen switching between smart devices by prefetching contents in advance so that the user can watch the contents without interruption. In order to minimize the amount of contents to be prefetched, we also propose an enhanced prefetching scheme that takes into account user's movement direction. According to our performance evaluation, the average switching delay time was approximately 480 ms, and traffic loads was reduced by on average of 12 {\%} by the enhanced prefetching scheme compared to an existing one when the user is watching Full HD contents across smart devices dispersed throughout an office of 20 m by 20 m.",

In contrast to the conventional wireless sensor network operations based on the client--server computing model, recent research has shown the efficiency of agent-based data collection and aggregation in collaborative and ubiquitous environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of calculating multiple itineraries for MAs to visit source nodes in parallel. Our algorithm iteratively partitions a directional sector zone where the source nodes are included in an itinerary. The length of an itinerary is controlled by the angle of the directional sector zone in such a way that near-optimal routes for MAs can be obtained by selecting the angle efficiently in an adaptive fashion. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as well as its performance gain over alternative approaches.",

The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of Chinese health professionals during a 12-month implementation period of the intelligent bed in a rehabilitation department at a large tertiary hospital in Guangzhou. A documentary study was carried out 3 months prior to implementation. Participant observation totalling 35 h and qualitative semi-structured interviews with 9 h and 50 min were conducted over a 12-month testing period. Findings in this study highlighted the improved working ergonomics of the intelligent bed in comparison with regular hospital mechanical beds. The bed's other advanced functions, however, were either not used by the staff, quickly abandoned after a month, or never fully implemented. Barriers to full implementation of the bed's functions were the Chinese hierarchical organizational culture, inadequate training of the health professionals on the implementation of the intelligent bed, lack of user-friendliness, and insufficient technical support.",

A BAN, which basically consists of wireless wearable sensor nodes usually coordinated by a static or mobile device, is mainly exploited to monitor single assisted livings. Data generated by a BAN can be processed in real-time by the BAN coordinator and/or transmitted to a server-side for online/offline processing and long-term storing. A network of BANs worn by a community of people produces large amount of contextual data that require a scalable and efficient approach for elaboration and storage. Cloud computing can provide a flexible storage and processing infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis of body sensor data streams. In this paper, we motivate the introduction of Cloud-assisted BANs along with the main challenges that need to be addressed for their development and management. The current state-of-the-art is overviewed and framed according to the main requirements for effective Cloud-assisted BAN architectures.

In general, Disease control strategies are only the spatial information like landscape, weather and climate, but also spatially explicit information like socioeconomic variable, population density, behavior and natural habits of the people. The spatial multi-criteria decision analysis approach combines the multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic information system (GIS) to model the spatially explicit and implicit information and to make a practical decision under different scenarios and different environment. Malaria is one of the emerging diseases worldwide; the cause of malaria is weather {\&} climate condition of the study area. The climate condition is often called as spatially implicit information, traditional decision-making models do not use the spatially implicit information it most often uses spatially explicit information such as socio-economic, natural habits of the people. There is need to develop an integrated approach that consists of spatially implicit and explicit information. The proposed approach is used to identity an effective control strategy that prevents and control of malaria. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method used in this paper to assign the weight values based on the neighborhood locations.

With respect to communications, wireless body area networks (WBANs) are highly suitable communication technologies for wearable M2M. Most existing research for WBANs have mainly focused on a one-hop star network configuration due to their ease of implementation. However, in an environment with a real wearable M2M system, a multi-hop network can be a more suitable solution for communication due to its various advantages, including a low heat generation, low path loss, low inter-network interference, etc., despite the high difficulty in management. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN configuration approach (MWCA) for wearable M2M systems. MWCA improves network throughput by exploiting multi-channel communications, and it achieves high energy efficiency by reducing the transmission power of each M2M device. We also investigate the performance of MWCA by using an analytical model, which is validated through the use of experimental simulations.",

Presently, the key challenges faced by big data are security, privacy, and accuracy.

In this study, we propose the Analytic Network Process (ANP) technique for evaluating these challenges. The study also appraises the ANP model in comparison with the priorities of all competing challenges inside the big data. The secondary data has been taken for the ANP analysis from numerous scholarly articles focusing on big data. In our analysis, we have proposed a policy assessment of the relation between big data characteristics and the challenges; it further prioritizes the consequent results for the most influential challenge by using ANP model. The empirical results conclude that the security has the highest influence value i.e. 54{\%} of the total measurement, while privacy and accuracy stand second and third among the most influential factors with 36{\%} and 8{\%} values respectively.

Various nature-inspired routing mechanisms are proposed to achieve scalable solutions. However, conventional nature-inspired optimization algorithms are insufficient to solve discrete routing optimization problems. In this study, a new discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) based routing protocol is designed to achieve better performance. In the new protocol, firstly, two new fitness functions with energy awareness for clustering and routing are formulated respectively. Secondly, a novel greedy discrete PSO with memory (GMDPSO) is put forward to build optimal routing tree. In GMDPSO, particle's position and velocity are redefined under a discrete scenario; particle update rules are reconsidered based on the network topology; a greedy search strategy is designed to drive particles to find better positon quickly. Besides, searching histories are memorized to accelerate convergence. Simulations results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the new protocol.",

To make this information available, many question answering (QA) systems over KBs were created in the last years. Building a QA system over KBs is difficult because there are many different challenges to be solved. In order to address these challenges, QA systems generally combine techniques from natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning and Semantic Web. The aim of this survey is to give an overview of the techniques used in current QA systems over KBs. We present the techniques used by the QA systems which were evaluated on a popular series of benchmarks: Question Answering over Linked Data. Techniques that solve the same task are first grouped together and then described. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed for each technique. This allows a direct comparison of similar techniques. Additionally, we point to techniques that are used over WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions, which are two other popular benchmarks for QA systems.",

abstract="Outlier detection is critical for many applications such as healthcare, health insurance, medical diagnosis, predictive analytics, pattern recognition, intrusion detection, anomaly or defect detection, video surveillance, credit card fraud detection and text mining. Outlier detection techniques could be statistics, distance- or model based. Techniques, which are based on a single method for outlier detection usually have weaknesses and strengths and are mostly unstable. Outlier detection ensembles harness the strengths of individual detectors and result in stable performance. This paper presents a new parameter based growing self-organizing maps ensemble (GSOME) for outlier detection in multivariate patterns. For outlier detection, the proposed GSOME transforms non-linear relationships between high dimensional patterns into a simple 1D geometric relationship. Whatever the pattern dimensionality is, it is mapped to a single point of a line. The dispersion of mapped points will be used to locate the outliers and measure the degree of outlyingness. Several experiments on both real and synthetic data sets show the promising performance of the proposed GSOME.",

abstract="Accurate categorization of cirrhosis liver image in ultrasound modality is of great importance in medical diagnosis and treatment. Health informatics is important as it provides quick predictions on diseases based on nearness of symptoms. Modelling solutions for the same on cloud using deep learning is the motivation of this paper. Here, we propose a deep learning model associated with correlation based feature selection method for cirrhosis image classification. We compare the results with three other conventional classifiers algorithms to improve the better classification accuracy. First in pre-processing stage, noises are eliminated from pathological scan images by using modified laplacian pyramid non-linear diffusion filter. From the pre-processed scan images, each cirrhosis region is obtained under the guidance of radiology or physicians. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch by gray level, local binary pattern and scale invariant feature, a feature selection technique is applied to choice the predominant texture features for each classifier. Finally a convolution neural network is implemented to improve the performance of classifiers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Convolution neural network algorithm with two hidden layers gives more accuracy in classifying cirrhosis image with 98{\%} sensitivity. Experiments are carried out with 990 cirrhosis image patches which demonstrates that our proposed deep learning classifier perform 100{\%} well than original classifiers in terms of accuracy.",

abstract="In wireless sensor deployments, network layer multicast can be used to improve the bandwidth and energy efficiency for a variety of applications, such as service discovery or network management. However, despite efforts to adopt IPv6 in networks of constrained devices, multicast has been somewhat overlooked. The Multicast Forwarding Using Trickle (Trickle Multicast) internet draft is one of the most noteworthy efforts. The specification of the IPv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) also attempts to address the area but leaves many questions unanswered. In this paper we highlight our concerns about both these approaches. Subsequently, we present our alternative mechanism, called stateless multicast RPL forwarding algorithm (SMRF), which addresses the aforementioned drawbacks. Having extended the TCP/IP engine of the Contiki embedded operating system to support both trickle multicast (TM) and SMRF, we present an in-depth comparison, backed by simulated evaluation as well as by experiments conducted on a multi-hop hardware testbed. Results demonstrate that SMRF achieves significant delay and energy efficiency improvements at the cost of a small increase in packet loss. The outcome of our hardware experiments show that simulation results were realistic. Lastly, we evaluate both algorithms in terms of code size and memory requirements, highlighting SMRF's low implementation complexity.

abstract="Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) have emerged as a promising data gathering paradigm for animal preservation. In MWSNs, it is challenging to efficiently transmit data between resource-constrained mobile sensor nodes and static gateway nodes because of its unreliable and unpredictable nature. Further, elaborate statistics must be known in advance to properly decide when packets should be transmitted, and how many of them to transmit. However, mobility of targets, and instability and intermittency of wireless connections make the system difficult to control. In this paper, we propose EETC, an optimal Energy-Efficient Transmission Control strategy for MWSNs, to deal with the problem based on Lyapunov optimization. EETC comprises two steps: (1) network status collection: collecting, by way of probing messages and acknowledgement messages, information about quality of connectivity and queue backlog; (2) decision making: the mobile sensor node decides on the number of packets that should be transmitted.

abstract="Being deployed in narrow but long area, strip wireless sensor networks (SWSNs) have drawn much attention in applications such as coal mines, pipeline and structure monitoring. One of typical characteristics of SWSNs is the large hop counts, which leads to long end-to-end delivery delay in low-duty-cycle SWSNs. To reduce the delay, pipeline scheduling is a promising technique, which assigns sensor nodes sequential active time slots along the data forwarding path. However, pipeline scheduling is prone to failure when communication links are unreliable. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic pipeline scheduling algorithm (OPS) for SWSNs, based on the observation that sensor nodes in SWSNs can overhear data transmissions passing by them. OPS exploits nodes outside the data forwarding path to opportunistically provide links when transmission failure happens, and hence maintains the pipeline forwarding instead of retransmission in the next duty cycle. Theoretical calculation shows that the expectation delay of OPS is always smaller than that of existing methods when the link quality i,

pages="2683--2711",
abstract="Congestion in Wireless Sensor Networks is one of the primary causes of performance degradation due to severe packet loss leading to excessive energy consumption. Normally, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network gets fragmented. To mitigate this issue, we propose a three phase energy balanced zone based routing protocol. Specifically, in the first phase the region is physically divided into equi-sized zones. In the second phase, a node with minimum traffic and minimum distance from other nodes inside each zone is selected as the zone leader. This leader is responsible for delivering data generated by any node in that zone and for routing and forwarding the data received from other zone leaders of the neighbor zones. In the third phase, zones are categorized as non-congested, medium-congested and congested zones and route path is established in inter and intra zones. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the zone congestion levels along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed both at inter and intra zone levels in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 10.5{\%} enhancement in the network throughput, 19.5{\%} energy saving when compared with grid-based multi-path GMCAR with congestion avoidance and 23.03{\%} energy saving when compared with priority-based application-specific congestion control clustering protocol PASCC.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks have been widely suggested to be used in cyber-physical systems for structural health monitoring. However, for nowadays high-rise structures (e.g., the Guangzhou New TV Tower, peaking at 600 m above ground), the extensive vertical dimension creates enormous challenges toward sensor data collection, beyond those addressed in state-of-the-art mote-like systems. One example is data transmission from sensor nodes to the base station. Given the long span of the civil structures, neither a strategy of long-range one-hop data transmission nor short-range hop-by-hop communication is cost-efficient. In this paper, we propose EleSense, a novel high-rise structure monitoring framework that uses elevators to assist data collection. In EleSense, an elevator is attached with the base station and collects data when it moves to serve passengers; as such, the communication distance can be effectively reduced. To maximize the benefit, we formulate the problem as a cross-layer optimization problem and propose a centralized algorithm to solve it optimally. We further propose a distributed implementation to accommodate the hardware capability of sensor nodes and address other practical issues. Through extensive simulations, we show that EleSense has achieved a significant throughput gain over the case without elevators and a straightforward 802.11 MAC scheme without cross-layer optimization. Our distributed implementation in EleSense performs only marginally worse,

abstract="Video frame manipulation has become commonplace with the growing easy access to powerful computing abilities. One of the most common types of video frame tampers is the copy-paste tamper, wherein a region from a video frame is replaced with another region from the same frame. In order to improve the robustness of passive video tampering detection, we propose a content-based video similarity tamper passive blind detection algorithm based on multi-scale normalized mutual information which can implement video frame copy, frame insertion and frame deletion tamper detection. The detail implementation of the proposed algorithm consists of multi-scale content analysis, single-scale content similarity measure, multi-scale content similarity measure, and tampering positioning. Firstly, we get the scales of the visual content of the video frame using Gaussian pyramid transform; Secondly, to measure the similarity of single-scale visual content, we define adjacent normalized mutual information of two frames according to information theory; Thirdly, we construct the multi-scale normalized mutual information descriptors to achieve the multi-scale visual content similarity measure of adjacent two frames using a linear combination. Finally, we use the local outlier isolated factor detection algorithm to detect the position of the video tampering. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only detect the video frame tampering position of delete, copy, and insert effectively, but also can detect the tampering of different and homology video encoding formats. We obtain a feature detecting accuracy in excess of 93{\%} and detection rate of 96{\%} across post processing operations, and are able to detect the delete, copy, and insert regions with a high true positive rate and lower false positive rate than the existing time field tamper detection methods.",

abstract="A joint scheduling and optimal resource allocation scheme for wireless personal area network using visible light is proposed. In current IEEE 802.15.7 standard, multiple channel scheduling in medium access control (MAC) layer and variable data rate opportunity in physical layer (PHY) are performed separately. Therefore, the resources are not utilized effectively owing to the exclusion of channel variable characteristics during the scheduling. In this paper, the case for combining the PHY and MAC layer into a cross-layer platform is conducted for utilizing the resources efficiently. Generally in visible light communication (VLC) system, data rate of one link impacts on its neighbor link due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and this impact varies gradually according to some perspectives such as, field-of-view interaction and distance, hence allocated rate of both users could be dissipated. Moreover, the cell radius in VLC system is small compared with other small cell network and users from adjacent cells impact on transmission link which arises co-channel interference. To solve these problems, a novel joint scheduling and rate allocation (JSRA) algorithm associated with throughput maximization and channel-state has been proposed in VLC scenario. The objective of JSRA model is, each channel can determine the feasibility of its rate which always intends to increase, by exploiting the constraint value of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of that scheduled channel. The results show that the performance of joint control approach increases the total system average throughput and the spectral efficiency.",

abstract="Wireless body area network (WBAN) has witnessed significant attentions in the healthcare domain using biomedical sensor-based monitoring of heterogeneous nature of vital signs of a patient's body. The design of frequency band, MAC superframe structure, and slots allocation to the heterogeneous nature of the patient's packets have become the challenging problems in WBAN due to the diverse QoS requirements. In this context, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Traffic Prioritization for Medium Access Control (EETP-MAC) protocol, which provides sufficient slots with higher bandwidth and guard bands to avoid channels interference causing longer delay. Specifically, the design of EETP-MAC is broadly divided in to four folds. Firstly, patient data traffic prioritization is presented with broad categorization including Non-Constrained Data (NCD), Delay-Constrained Data (DCD), Reliability-Constrained Data (RCD) and Critical Data (CD). Secondly, a modified superframe structure design is proposed for effectively handling the traffic prioritization. Thirdly, threshold based slot allocation technique is developed to reduce contention by effectively quantifying criticality on patient data. Forth, an energy efficient frame design is presented focusing on beacon interval, superframe duration, and packet size and inactive period. Simulations are performed to comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed EETP-MAC with the state-of-the-art MAC protocols. The comparative evaluation attests the benefit of EETP-MAC in terms of efficient slot allocation resulting in lower delay and energy consumption.",

To this aim five special antenna correlation cases are discussed and the corresponding overall spectral efficiency is analyzed.

abstract="In this paper, a high speed, reliable, low memory demanding and precise object detection and tracking algorithm is proposed. The proposed work uses a macroblock of rectangular shape, which is placed in the very first frame of the video to detect and track a single moving object using monocular camera. The macroblocks are positioned in the field of view (FOV) of camera where the probability of occurrence of object is high. After placing macroblocks, a threshold value is examined to detect the presence of objects in the selected macroblocks. Afterwards, a quadtree approach is used to minimize the bounding box and to reduce the pixelation. A tracking algorithm is proposed which illustrates a unique method to find the moving directional vectors. The proposed method is based on macroblock resizing, which demonstrates an accuracy rate of 98.5{\%} with low memory utilization.",

abstract="Detection and analysis of activities of daily living (ADLs) are important in activity tracking, security monitoring, and life support in elderly healthcare. Recently, many research projects have employed wearable devices to detect and analyze ADLs. However, most wearable devices obstruct natural movement of the body, and the analysis of activities lacks adequate consideration of various real attributes. To tackle these issues, we proposed a two-fold solution. First, regarding unobtrusive detection of ADLs, only one small device is worn on a finger to sense and collect activity information, and identifiable features are extracted from the finger-related signals to identify various activities. Second, to reflect realistic life situations, a weighted sequence alignment approach is proposed to analyze an activity sequence detected by the device, as well as attributes of each activity in the sequence. The system is validated using 10 daily activities and 3 activity sequences. Results show 96.8 {\%} accuracy in recognizing activities and the effectiveness of sequence analysis.",

abstract="Independent living of senior citizens is one of the main challenges linked to the ageing population. Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including the decline in cardiopulmonary conditions, weaker muscle functions and a declined neuromuscular control of the movements, which result in a higher risk of fall and a higher vulnerability for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With respect to cognitive functions, senior citizens may suffer from a decline of memory function, less ability to orientate and a declined ability to cope with complex situations. This is by itself a big societal challenge with impact in multiple sectors. In this paper we present an innovative ICT solution, named eWALL, that aims to address these challenges by means of an advanced ICT infrastructure and home sensing environment; thus differentiating from existing eHealth and eCare solutions. The system of eWALL will extend the state-of-the-art of Assistive Platforms and will significantly increase the independent living of seniors.",

abstract="The success of mobile networks has been driven by the services offered, i.e. voice in second generation and multimedia services in third generation networks. Similarly, a key issue for the success of future generation networks is considered to be the provision of enhanced, always available, personalised services. At the same time, the complexity and heterogeneity of the infrastructure of mobile network operators increases as Radio Access Technologies continue to evolve and new ones emerge. All these issues call for self-management and learning capabilities in future generation network systems. Cognitive, reconfigurable systems encompassing self-management and learning capabilities have been devised as a solution in this direction. Cognitive systems determine their behaviour, in a self-managed way. This is done reactively or proactively, based on goals, policies, knowledge and experience obtained through learning. This paper focuses on the user device and presents a Cognitive Device Management System that comprises mechanisms for dynamically selecting the optimal device configuration, taking into account user preferences, device environment characteristics (context), policies, and knowledge established through machine learning functionality.",

abstract="Sustaining independent living for elderly people in their own homes is desirable for various reasons. As older people become frail or disabled, a `gap' appears between the abilities they still have and the abilities that are required for independent living. To a certain extent robots may close this gap by providing functionality lost through frailty or disability. A scenario was created involving a re-enablement coach robot. This scenario was discussed with older people, informal carers, and care professionals in focus groups in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and France. The results provided insights into the acceptability of robots and showed that older people were open to the idea of having a robot supporting them in their daily life. Participants were also willing to have a robot perform higher level coordinating tasks while playing the role of the re-enablement coach. However, participants wanted the robot to operate at the same level of intelligence as a human carer. This implies that more attention needs to be given to the development of the social skills and behaviour of such robots. Additionally, participants acknowledged that such a robot would create tension between respecting the autonomy of the user (i.e. robot obeys all commands given by the user) and the promotion of independence in the long term (i.e. robot is programmed to maintain the abilities the user still has). Our results indicate that people preferred to resolve this tension in favour of autonomy. This choice, however, may decrease the user's abilities in the longer term and thereby undermine users' ability to live independently.",

Falls detection was implemented by analyzing whether the postures classified as `lying' or `sit-tilted' posture are deemed normal or abnormal, based on the analysis of time, users' current position and posture transition. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach can detect various types of falls efficiently (i.e., in real-time within a smart phone processor) and also correctly (95 {\%} and 93 {\%} true positives for falls ending with `lying' and `sit-tilted' respectively). The approach is reliable for different subjects and different situations, since it is not only based on empirical thresholds and subject-based training models, but in addition it is underpinned by theory.",

pages="883--898",
abstract="Although existing wakeup scheduling techniques suggest end-to-end delay guarantees for real-time applications, their fixed wakeup schedules may not meet such constraints when multiple sensors compete for the event delivery at the same time. In this paper we propose a new MAC protocol called SPEED-MAC that can provide real-time delay guarantees with much lower energy consumption for both single-source and multi-source events. The main ideas underlying the protocol are twofold. First, we introduce a novel wakeup technique called signaling wakeup, which is small only enough to detect the event occurrence. By employing the signaling wakeup we can minimize the event report latency as well as the idle listening. Second, to resolve the collisions and contentions incurred by multi-source events, the protocol employs adaptive wakeup that combines static scheduling with contention-based media access control depending on the type of traffic. The result of our analytic evaluation confirms that SPEED-MAC can provide real-time delay guarantees even for a large-scale network assuming a low event rate. We have implemented SPEED-MAC on both NS-2 and MICA2 platforms, and evaluated both the energy and the network performance of the protocol for various scenarios including multi-source, multi-sink, source-to-sink, sink-to-source, multi-cast and broadcast traffic. Our experimentation results show that SPEED-MAC can achieve an order of magnitude energy savings while providing near optimal latency compared to the existing solutions.",

Five different test study cases are presented, four in Slovenia and one in Austria, each with different specific target user groups and their own dynamics. According to the project disposition goals the focus was on the elderly. Methods, such as think-aloud protocol in combination with a guided interview and observation of verbal as well as of non-verbal responses, were used. To ensure the repeatability of tests and to help guide the process, a special questionnaire was developed. The research questions focused on: the navigation and interaction concept, the content, the readability, and the overall acceptance and the perception of value of the TV-WEB service. More than 74 users participated in the user experience studies, 27 of them 65 years old or older. The results indicate that the presented navigation and interaction concept is indeed intuitive and simple enough to be used by most users with no or little effort. This is especially proven by the results from studies at both elderly citizens homes, where the majority of participants were 65 years old or older.",

abstract="With the increasing demands for high-quality health-care services, medical cyber-physical systems over wireless body sensor networks have emerged as a promising solution for vital life signals monitoring. These systems require the communication protocols to be both reliable and real-time in data transmissions. IEEE 802.15.4 can be regarded as the canonical protocols in this area owing to its low-power and low-cost features. However, it falls short of reliability and timeliness guarantees. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive MAC protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4, namely Ada-MAC. The proposed protocol combines schedule-based on time-triggered protocol and contention-based CSMA/CA mechanism. It can not only enable dynamic Guaranteed Time Slots allocation but also provide differentiated services for different nodes according to their data types. The proposed protocol is implemented on the OMNeT++ platform. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of Ada-MAC in comparison with the traditional IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. The results show the superiority of the proposed protocol in terms of reliability and timeliness.",

Conventional brain images do not provide sufficient information to diagnose AD at an early stage. To delay the progression of memory impairment, there is a dire need to develop systems capable of early AD diagnosis. This paper describes a proposed fuzzy method for inferring the risk of dementia using the brain cortical thickness and hippocampus thickness. The aim is to develop a reliable index that allows the evaluation of brain health. The dementia index poses potential to become a biologically based biomarker for the clinical assessment of patient's dementia. Results show that the inference value of patient with mild cognitive impairment is significantly higher than that of healthy (control) or schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Our results suggest that a higher inference value indicates that the patient is at higher risk and is more likely to eventually progress to AD. The system is also tested with age-associated memory impairment patients. The results confirm that our model is able to distinguish between these four patient groups.",

Visualizing the output of these remote rendering applications is typically achieved through native applications or, when considering a browser environment, through plug-ins. In this paper, several solutions are presented that enable deployment of these applications on standard web browsers, even those from the pre-HTML5 era. The focus in this paper is on two specific use case scenarios, taking into account that the proposed solutions are generic enough to be applied to a range of similar applications. The technologies presented cover the entire range of sub-processes contained in a complete remote rendering solution, such as the establishment of interaction feedback channels and delivery of images as part of the rendering pipeline. Depending on factors such as application requirements, developer preferences, feature availability in the web browser or raw performance figures, a custom solution can be composed from the options discussed in this paper. This is illustrated by applying them to the two aforementioned use cases, each with specific requirements and challenges, and benchmarking these example setups in terms of performance. A comparison of advantages and disadvantages is presented to guide developers in applying the technologies under real-life conditions.",

abstract="As wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) can be used in many different domains, WSAN applications have to be built from two viewpoints: domain and network. These different viewpoints create a gap between the abstractions handled by the application developers, namely the domain and network experts. Furthermore, there is a coupling between the application logic and the underlying sensor platform, which results in platform-dependent projects and source codes difficult to maintain, modify, and reuse. Consequently, the process of developing an application becomes cumbersome. In this paper, we propose a model-driven architecture (MDA) approach for WSAN application development. Our approach aims to facilitate the task of the developers by: (1) enabling application design through high abstraction level models; (2) providing a specific methodology for developing WSAN applications; and (3) offering an MDA infrastructure composed of PIM, PSM, and transformation programs to support this process. Our approach allows the direct contribution of domain experts in the development of WSAN applications, without requiring specific knowledge of programming WSAN platforms. In addition, it allows network experts to focus on the specific characteristics of their area of expertise without the need of knowing each specific application domain.",

abstract="Data science augments manual data understanding with machine learning for potential performance increase. In this paper, data science methodology is examined to enhance machine learning application in smartphone based automatic human activity recognition (HAR). Eventually, a modified feature engineering and a novel post-learning data engineering are proposed in the machine learning framework as the alternate of data understanding for an effective HAR. The proposed framework is examined on two different HAR data sets demonstrating a possibility of data-driven machine learning for near an optimal classification of activities. The proposed framework exhibited effectiveness and efficiency when compared with the existing methods. The modified feature engineering resulted in 42{\%} fewer features required by support vector machine to yield 97.3{\%} correct recognition of human physical activities. However, the addition of post-learning data engineering further improved the model to perform 99{\%} accurate classification, which is an almost optimal performance.",

A project started during the 1990s is still facing the task to introduce a policy system for the commercial sector. The project had its origin in a merger with another German insurer and the system has since evolved over about 18 years. The project team encounters manifold technical and organisational issues as well as external factors which have led the project to a state which requires a decision about its continuance. Driven by a new political agenda that fosters the replacement of mainframe solutions and the use of standard rather than in-house solutions, decisions needed to be made concerning the sourcing strategy: should the system be implemented in-house or with the help of an external partner? Should it be realised by standard software or custom development? A steering committee meeting is set up to decide how to proceed. This case chronicles the series of events leading to that upcoming steering committee and the status quo of the system.",

abstract="This paper explores the question of how foresight and futures research can identify and address ethical issues in the field of Information Systems (IS). Starting from the premise that such IS are part of socio-technical systems, the interaction between technology and human actors raise ethical concerns. Early recognition of these concerns can address ethical issues and improve the use of the technology for a range of social and organisational goals. This paper discusses research conducted in two futures research projects. Both projects investigated emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) and ethics. The first project established approaches for identifying future technologies and their related ethical concerns. This led to the identification of 11 emerging ICTs and their associated ethical concerns. The second project took these general ethical concerns and focused on their role in IS. Specifically, how IS professionals view future emerging technologies, their associated ethical concerns, and how they think these concerns could be addressed. The key findings are that IS professionals are primarily interested in the job at hand and less so in the ethical concerns that the job might bring; ethics is a concern that is best left for others to deal with. This paper considers the implications of research on ethics in emerging ICTs and draws general conclusions about the relevance of future technologies research in IS.",

We also examine the ten most popular free mVoIP apps for Android devices, and analyse the communications to determine whether the voice and text communications using these mVoIP apps are encrypted. The results indicate that most of the apps encrypt text communications, but voice communications may not have been encrypted in Fring, ICQ, Tango, Viber, Vonage, WeChat and Yahoo.

abstract="Congestion control in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is crucial. In this article, we discuss congestion control and the adaptive load-aware problem for sensor nodes in WSNs. When the traffic load of a specific node exceeds its the available capacity of the node, a congestion problem occurs because of buffer memory overflow. Congestion may cause serious problems such as packet loss, the consumption of power, and low network throughput for sensor nodes. To address these problems, we propose a distributed congestion control protocol called adaptive load-aware congestion control protocol (ALACCP). The protocol can adaptively allocate the appropriate forwarding rate for jammed sensor nodes to mitigate the congestion load. Through the buffer management mechanism, the congestion index of neighboring sensor nodes, and an adjustment of the adaptive forwarding rate, the degree of congestion is alleviated markedly. The performance in allocating the forwarding rate effectively to neighboring sensor nodes also improves. The ALACCP can avoid packet loss because of traffic congestion, reduce the power consumption of nodes, and improve the network throughput. Simulation results revealed that the proposed ALACCP can effectively improve network performance and maintain the fairness of networks.",

In this paper, we propose an IP-based mobility management protocol named Fast handover Proxy Mobile IPv6 for Sensor networks (FPMIPv6-S). FPMIPv6-S provides network-based mobility support for 6LoWPAN WSN when a sensor node moves between two Personal Area Networks. It is an improved version of the PMIPv6 protocol proposed for mobility management in IPv6 networks. FPMIPv6-S messages are carried by RPL protocol. Analytical evaluation of the proposed protocol shows significantly improved performance with respect to network mobility cost (signalling traffic) when compared to PMIPv6 and RPL alone. We also integrated the FPMIPv6-S protocol in the NS-3 simulator and performed a thorough performance comparison of FPMIPv6-S and RPL.",

abstract="Advancements in technology have transformed mobile devices from being mere communication widgets to versatile computing devices. Proliferation of these hand held devices has made them a common mean to access and process digital information. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can conveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, web-services (applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans) are not as commonly provided/consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating this and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has the potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the major challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service registry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile mobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for traditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided `solely' over mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end computing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in the form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility of our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the proposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the proposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) registry is also included. The evaluation of our framework has shown propitious results in terms of battery cost, scalability, hindrance with native applications.",

abstract="Recent advancements in wireless communication have made it possible to use low-power invasive or non-invasive sensor nodes to remotely monitor patients through wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, reliable and secure data transmission in WBANs is a challenging task. The issues such as privacy and confidentiality of patient related data require the reliable and secure data routing so that data can be kept safe from the malicious nodes. On the other hand, conventional biometric and cryptographic algorithms cannot be used in WBANs as they are, most of the time, complex and do not consider the misbehaving nature of nodes. Moreover, wireless nature of in vivo biomedical sensor nodes produces electromagnetic radiations which result in increased temperature; that could be harmful particularly for sensitive tissues. Therefore, trust and temperature based lightweight and resource efficient solutions are ultimate pre-requisite for WBAN. In this paper, we propose a trust and thermal-aware routing protocol for WBANs that considers trust among and temperature of nodes to isolate misbehaving nodes. This multi-facet routing strategy helps in providing a trusted and balanced network environment and restricts hotspot/misbehaving nodes to be part of trusted routes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol performs better in terms of packet drop ratio, packet delay, throughput and temperature under varying traffic conditions as compared other state-of-art schemes.",

abstract="Congestion in wireless sensor networks degrades the quality of the channel and network throughput. This leads to packet loss and energy dissipation. To cope with this problem, a two-stage cognitive network congestion control approach is presented in this paper. In the first stage of the proposed strategy, initially downstream nodes calculate their buffer occupancy ratio and estimate congestion degree in the MAC layer. Then, they send the estimated value to both network and transport layers of their upstream nodes. The network layer of the upstream node uses TOPSIS in order to rank all neighbors to select the best one as the next relay node. In the second stage, transport layer of the given node adjusts the transmission rate using an optimized regression analysis by RSM. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed method not only decreases packet loss, but also significantly improves throughput and energy efficiency under different traffic conditions, especially in heavy traffic areas. Also, Tukey test is used to compare performance of algorithms as well as to demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly better than other methods.",

We present the results of benchmarking both the computational power and network performance of the ``Iridis-Pi.''

abstract="One of the most critical and challenging issues when developing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is how to extend the network lifetime. Sensors are energy-constrained devices that require developing minimization techniques and mechanisms in order to exploit perfectly the energy and to prolong as long as possible the overall network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a limited energy consumption model for P2P wireless sensor networks, which takes a benefit of the Chord assets and adapts this last one so that it will be suitable for P2P WSNs. Chord in its basic form optimizes the path length by minimizing the number of hops, but it does not optimize the energy, since it was designed for wired networks. The key idea of our proposal is to optimize both the number of hops and the energy consumption to provide an energy-efficient routing scheme for P2P WSNs. The proposed enhanced Chord scheme makes a use of only Cluster-Heads (with the strongest level of energy) to construct the ring, which reduces the Chord topology while preserving the network connectivity. In the enhanced Chord scheme, Cluster-Heads are elected automatically and dynamically over the time, which helps to extend the network longevity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme proves good performances in terms of hops number, alive nodes over the time and energy efficiency.",

abstract="Centerline is generally used to measure topological and morphological parameters of blood vessels, which is pivotal for the quantitative analysis of vascular diseases. However, previous centerline extraction methods have two drawbacks on complex blood vessels, represented as the failure on ring-like structures and the existing of multi-voxel width. In this paper, we propose a monocentric centerline extraction method for ring-like blood vessels, which consists of three components. First, multiple centerlines are generated from the seed points that are chosen by randomly sprinkling points on blood vessel data. Second, multi-centerline fusion is used to repair the notches of centerlines on ring-like vessels, and the local maximum of distance from oundary is employed to remedy the missing centerline points. Finally, monocentric processing is devised to keep the vascular centerline with single voxel width. We compared the proposed method with Wan et al.'s method and topological thinning on five groups of data including synthesized vascular datasets and MR brain images. The result showed the proposed method performed better than the two contrast methods both by visual inspection and by quantitative assessment, which demonstrated the performance of the proposed method on ring-like blood vessels as well as the elimination of multi-voxel width points.",

In this paper, we introduce the case of a leading firm in China called Mingdao that provides an ESS platform via the SaaS delivery model. Our teaching case gives insights into how Mingdao experienced its platform's early tortuous design and development, defined its business and revenue model, and improved its platform's various functions and features. Such organizational experiences not only reflect the opportunities and challenges of the ESS market in China, but also present a new way of communication, collaboration, and sharing on the enterprise social network platform.

abstract="Computational radio frequency identification (CRFID) sensors present a new frontier for pervasive sensing and computing. They exploit ambient light or radio frequency (RF) for energy and use backscatter communication with an RFID reader for data transfer. Unlike conventional RFID tags that only transmit identifiers, CRFID sensors need to transfer potentially large amounts of data to a reader during each contact. Existing EPC Gen2 protocol is inefficient in dealing with a small number of CRFID sensors transferring a large amount of buffered data to the RFID reader and it has no specific design for adaptation to dynamic energy harvesting and channel conditions. In this article, we propose to adopt dynamic frame length and charging time for CRFID backscatter communication, aiming to adapt to the changing energy harvesting and channel conditions and improve the system goodput. First, optimal frame length and charging time that maximizes the goodput are obtained by solving the formulated goodput optimization problem. Then we propose a dynamic frame length and charging time adaptation scheme (DFCA) that increase or decrease the frame length and charging time at runtime based on the goodput measurement. Simulations show that our proposed DFCA scheme outperforms current fixed-frame-length approach and can converge to theoretically optimal under different energy harvesting and channel conditions.",

abstract="Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have emerged as fast growing networks with aims to provide safety, and comfort to the onboard passengers. But, in this environment reliable data dissemination to the destination nodes is one of the biggest challenges as there may be a congestion in the network due to blind flooding of messages to their final destination, called as broadcast storm which may lead to the performance degradation with respect to the metric such as-message delivery, reliability and response time. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a reliability-aware intelligent data dissemination protocol for broadcast storm problem in VANETs. We have solved the above specified problem using game theory concepts in which players, strategy space and decisions with respect to the current state of the system. To reduce the message overhead with respect to the communication cost among the players of the game, in the proposed scheme, messages are routed to the next destination by selecting the most reliable path in an intelligent manner. A coalition game is formulated among the vehicles by considering vehicles as the players in the game. Each player in the game has an initial payoff value based upon the parameters such as-communication range, storage requirements, and computation power. Based upon the payoff value of the players in the game, different coalitions/clusters are formulated among the players in the proposed scheme. Then, the players send the messages to the other vehicles/players within the same coalition which increases the reliability of transmission. In the proposed scheme, messages are unicasted to their final destination in an intelligent manner. Different algorithms are designed for coalition formation, maintenance, and reliability-aware data dissemination. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as-service time, packet delivery ration, and throughput. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as compared to the other state-of-the-art existing schemes.",

abstract="This paper presents an asynchronous cascading wake-up MAC protocol for heterogeneous traffic gathering in low-power wireless sensor networks. It jointly considers energy/delay optimization and switches between two modes, according to the traffic type and delay requirements. The first mode is high duty cycle, where energy is traded-off for a reduced latency in presence of realtime traffic (RT). The second mode is low duty cycle, which is used for non-realtime traffic and gives more priority to energy saving. The proposed protocol, DuoMAC, has many features. First, it quietly adjusts the wake-up of a node according to (1) its parent's wake-up time and, (2) its estimated load. Second, it incorporates a service differentiation through an improved contention window adaptation to meet delay requirements. A comprehensive analysis is provided in the paper to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in comparison with some state-of-the-art energy-delay efficient duty-cycled MAC protocols, namely DMAC, LL-MAC, and Diff-MAC. The network lifetime and the maximum end-to-end packet latency are adequately modeled, and numerically analyzed. The results show that LL-MAC has the best performance in terms of energy saving, while DuoMAC outperforms all the protocols in terms of delay reduction. To balance the delay/energy objectives, a runtime parameter adaptation mechanism has been integrated to DuoMAC. The mechanism relies on a constrained optimization problem with energy minimization in the objective function, constrained by the delay required for RT. The proposed protocol has been implemented on real motes using MicaZ and TinyOS. Experimental results show that the protocol clearly outperforms LL-MAC in terms of latency reduction, and more importantly, that the runtime parameter adaptation provides additional reduction of the latency while further decreasing the energy cost.",

Especially in a peer-to-peer (PTP) network, this may also lead to congestion and unfair usage of the links by users with superior link conditions. In this paper, in order to address the above mentioned problems a socially fair user scheduling algorithm (SFUSA) for a PTP is proposed. The proposed algorithm selects a leader from the PTP who will download data and share it within the PTP using a short range ad-hoc wireless network. In order to select the leader SFUSA takes into consideration the traffic conditions in the link of individual users from the data access point along with social fairness factor of the users. It is shown through simulations that the proposed algorithm solves the problem of congestion at the data access point, along with increased retention of peers in a PTP with enhanced user satisfaction.",

However, due to the huge data rate, it is still infeasible to process streaming WAMI in a real-time manner and achieve the goal of online, uninterrupted target tracking. In this paper, a pseudo-real-time Dynamic Data Driven Applications System (DDDAS) WAMI data stream processing scheme is proposed. Taking advantage of the temporal and spatial locality properties, a divide-and-conquer strategy is adopted to overcome the challenge resulting from the large amount of dynamic data. In the Pseudo Real-time Exploitation of Sub-Area (PRESA) framework, each WAMI frame is divided into multiple sub-areas and specified sub-areas are assigned to the virtual machines in a container-based cloud computing architecture, which allows dynamic resource provisioning to meet the performance requirements. A prototype has been implemented and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

This survey article provides an overview of the recent investigations where both vision and inertial sensors are used together and simultaneously to perform human action recognition more effectively. The thrust of this survey is on the utilization of depth cameras and inertial sensors as these two types of sensors are cost-effective, commercially available, and more significantly they both provide 3D human action data.

The eye movement is captured using silver chloride (AgCl) surface electrodes placed around eyes. The captured signal is further processed and transmitted using a VLC link to control smart home devices. To validate the proposed EOG-VLC based smart device control scheme, experiments were conducted. For the ease of the experiments, instead of an actual smart home device, we employed a digital door lock to verify its accurate control operation. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed smart device control scheme operates accurately and reliably. Therefore, since the proposed scheme is based on a less hazardous VLC link, it is envisioned that the scheme can pave the way for greener and safer smart homes, particularly benefiting disabled and elderly people.",

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using defensive jamming technique to protect enterprise Wi-Fi networks from potential eavesdroppers. This non-cryptographic approach requires neither any pre-shared key or high deployment costs. Defensive jammers geographically confine the wireless coverage of Wi-Fi access point, and thus block the message reception outside an arbitrary boundary at a physical layer. We provide a theoretical model fine tuning the jamming parameters for jammer placement.

abstract="With the development of GPS, Internet, and mobile devices, the map searching services become an essential application in people's lives. However, existing map searching services only support simple keywords based location search, which neglect users' complex search requirements, such as searching a hotel surrounded by station, shopping mall, cinema, etc. In this paper, we propose a map searching framework which maps users' complex search requirements into a graph pattern match problem. In this framework, the user's query requirements are mapped into a undirected graph, where the vertexes indicate the searched locations, and the edges represent the distance between connected locations. In this way, we propose a common pattern searching algorithm to give the top k matches groups and arrange them using a similarity. The similarity is defined by multi-model information, i.e., the graph structure, location categories, review stars, and review counts. Moreover, this method also allows user to input ambiguous and uncertain query condition with sketching query map. To adapt the method to large-scale data, we also filter the candidate groups by effective pruning methods.

abstract="Due to the existence of false positive rate of the traditional depression diagnosis method, this paper proposes a multi-modal fusion algorithm based on speech signal and facial image sequence for depression diagnosis. Introduced spectrum subtraction to enhance depressed speech signal, and use cepstrum method to extract pitch frequency features with large variation rate and formant features with significant difference, the short time energy and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients characteristic parameters for different emotion speeches are analyzed in both time domain and frequency domain, and establish a model for training and identification. Meanwhile, this paper implements the orthogonal match pursuit algorithm to obtain a sparse linear combination of face test samples, and cascade with voice and facial emotions based proportion. The experimental results show that the recognition rate based on the depression detection algorithm of fusion speech and facial emotions has reached 81.14{\%}. Compared to the existing doctor's accuracy rate of 47.3{\%}, the accuracy can bring extra 71.54{\%} improvement by combining with the proposed method of this paper.

abstract="The energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) provisioning of wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are two major issues that impact the application of such networks. Recent studies demonstrate that network performance can be greatly improved by involving multiple sinks. However, mainstream WMSN routing protocols are generally designed to account for a single sink. This paper proposes a QoS-aware multi-sink opportunistic routing (QMOR) to efficiently deliver multimedia information under QoS constraints for WMSNs. We begin with an optimal nodes selection problem to reduce redundant multimedia data. Then, we focus on selecting and prioritizing forwarder list to enhance transmission efficiency. Finally, the multi-sink-aware operations are integrated into an optimization opportunistic routing framework, with an objective to minimize energy consumption subject to delay and reliability constraints. Our simulation results demonstrate that the QMOR performs better than typical WMSN QoS routing algorithm, in terms of the video transmission quality and energy utilization efficiency.",

abstract="Nodes in wireless sensor networks are highly resource constrained and topology of such networks remains highly dynamic due to sudden death of sensor nodes and break of links. When mobility to such nodes is introduced, it gives rise to a highly complex network system since the topology becomes even more dynamic. Providing security in the routing layer of wireless sensor network is a highly critical issue mainly due to the stringent resource constraints and dynamic topology. In this paper, we propose a Secure Hierarchical and Role based Routing Protocol for Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (SHaRP) which is a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic approach. In the SHaRP framework, the sensor field is divided into some logical clusters and each cluster contains nodes with different roles such as ordinary sensor node (OSN), cluster head (CH) and gateway node (GN). Different keys are used by the nodes with distinct roles for message encryption and message decryption. The overall security has been entrusted on different roles in a distributed manner instead of relying on one authority and that is why this approach is safe from single point of failure problem. This also enhances the security in the network system. In this paper, we focus more on various security aspects in the routing process rather than the issues like cluster formation and role distribution. We shift most of the computing overhead to the base station as it is assumed to be a resourceful and reliable node. This obviously improves the energy efficiency of the protocol. We also report a security analysis along with implementation issues of the proposed protocol.",

abstract="In this paper, typical learning task including data condensation, binary classification, identification of the independence between random variables and conditional density estimation is described from a unified perspective of a linear combination of densities, and accordingly a direct estimation framework based on a linear combination of Gaussian components (i.e., Gaussian basis functions) under integrated square error criterion is proposed to solve these learning tasks. The proposed direct estimation framework has three advantages. Firstly, different from most of the existing state-of-the-art methods in which estimating each component's density in this linear combination of densities and then combining them linearly are required, it can directly estimate the linear combination of densities as a whole, and it has at least comparable to or even better approximation accuracy than the existing density estimation methods. Secondly, the time complexity of the proposed direct estimation framework is O(l                        3) in which l is the number of Gaussian components in this framework which are generally viewed as the Gaussian distributions of the clusters in a dataset, and hence l is generally much less than the size of the dataset, so it is very suitable for large datasets. Thirdly, this proposed framework can be typically used to develop alternative approaches to classification, data condensation, identification of the independence between random variables, conditional density estimation and the similarity identification between multiple source domains and a target domain. Our preliminary results about experiments on several typical applications indicate the power of the proposed direct estimation framework.",

abstract="Using existing virtual reality (VR) panorama systems to take panorama VR photos is a lengthy and inconvenient process involving the use of many photos. To relieve such inconvenience, this paper was researched and developed VR panorama rig systems that will enable automatic imaging through smartphone control. The X-axis and Y-axis rotations of the VR panorama rig system were automated through the control of two stepping motors, one attached to the X-axis, and the other attached to the Y-axis. In addition, for the imaging using smartphones, a method was proposed that would enable remote automatic imaging through shutter release by the micro controller and camera installed in the VR panorama rig system. Using the proposed system, an imaging time of 30 min in total can be reduced to 5 min with automatic rotation and automatic imaging. Through experiments, it was verified that the proposed method improve the accuracy of rotation angles and shorten imaging time during panorama VR imaging. In addition, the proposed method remarkably improved the efficiency of the entire process by substantially reducing the panorama stitching process, which requires large amounts of time and work and new organizing tools, so that most processes can progress automatically.",

Smart device makers endeavor to improve processing power and displays for better viewing experience. Ultimately, the common goal shared by content providers, network service providers, and smart device manufactures is to improve the QoE for users. QoE is both an objective and a subjective metric measuring the streaming quality experience by end users. It may be measured by streaming bitrate, playback smoothness, video quality metrics like Peak to Signal Noise Ratio, and other user satisfaction factors. There have been efforts made to improve the streaming experiences in all these aspects. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing literatures on QoE of video streaming to gain a deeper and more complete understanding of QoE quality metrics.

abstract="Delay jitter, which can affect the performance of controlled physical system and result in system instability, is an important issue for supporting instantaneity in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to guarantee continuous, real-time and dependable operation. Thus, it is significant to establish an algorithm to smoothing the delay jitter. In this paper, first, we compare several delay jitter smoothing algorithms, discuss their merits and demerits, and then propose one new algorithm over the existing algorithms, called derivative least square (DLS), which can eliminates the reverse way delay variation spikes. Second, we address the problem of most delay jitter smoothing schemes, namely they used uniformly distributed random numbers to simulate network delay data, which deviates from real network delay. To demonstrate the validity and reliability of DLS, except uniform distribution, Pareto distribution, of which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is more close to the CDF of real network delay, is applied to conduct the experiment. The experimental results show that compared with the other three existing algorithms, DLS can be more effective and reliable in predicting the play-back delay.",

In this paper, we propose a scheme for evaluating the condition of a user's skin based on their everyday activities collected from their postings. For such an evaluation, users should regularly send microscopic images of their skin to a server using their smartphone. Meanwhile, the server collects the user postings from their SNS and analyzes them to identify activities that might have an influence on their skin. Finally, the server provides the user with a report containing a comparison of their past and current skin conditions, a statistical summary of their occasional events collected from their SNS, and a set of advices for improving their skin condition including skin care products. We built a prototype system and performed various experiments to show the effectiveness of our scheme. We report some of the results.",

abstract="Many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require events be detected around moving targets and delivered to a user, whose location may also change over time. Consequently, it is not desirable to have a single sensor node serving as the sink node for centralized event processing. Furthermore, an event usually occurs across different locations and lasts for a period of time that are unknown in advance. Hence it cannot be detected by a static set of sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a general framework for such dynamic in-network event detection in WSNs. This framework enables a flexible number of sensor nodes to dynamically collaborate in detecting and delivering any specified event. So far there has been no such work reported in the literature. We have designed a protocol for the sensor nodes to autonomously determine whether they should participate in and which tasks they should perform to collaboratively process an event. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed framework using MicaZ motes and evaluated it through both simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework is effective and efficient in terms of energy cost and event processing delay.",

The proposed two processing units, PU1 and PU2, in the presented FastICA hardware architecture can be reused for the centering operation of preprocessing and the updating step of the fixed-point algorithm of the FastICA algorithm, and PU1 is reused for Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization operation of preprocessing and fixed-point algorithm to reduce the hardware cost and support 2-to-16 channel FastICA. Apart from the FastICA processing, the proposed hardware architecture supports re-reference, synchronized average, and moving average functions. The cost-effective and variable-channel FastICA hardware architecture is implemented in 90 nm 1P9M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process.

The link feasibility is examined for practical sensor models at two different frequencies (2.4 GHz and 868 MHz) and two corresponding bit rates (250 and 38.4 kbps) and shows the possibility of communications between the HAP and sensors at all scenarios. The CCA is optimized to improve the power gain inside the cell and reduce the out-of-cell sidelobe radiation using a modified Dolph-Chebyshev CCA. The comparison with conventional antenna models that give the same coverage radii shows that the link performance in terms of bit energy to noise power spectral density ratio can be improved by 11.37 dB for cells of 8 km radius and by 16.8 dB in the case of 30 km radius cells which make the link at 2.4 GHz to be feasible and realizable compared to using conventional antenna techniques.",

In this paper, we propose a fast and robust framework for detecting and localizing violence in surveillance scenes. For this purpose, a Gaussian Model of Optical Flow (GMOF) is proposed to extract candidate violence regions, which are adaptively modeled as a deviation from the normal behavior of crowd observed in the scene. Violence detection is then performed on each video volume constructed by densely sampling the candidate violence regions. To distinguish violent events from nonviolent events, we also propose a novel descriptor, named as Orientation Histogram of Optical Flow (OHOF), which are fed into a linear SVM for classification. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both detection accuracy and processing speed, even in crowded scenes.",

abstract="Mobile adhoc network is a mixture of various mobile sensor nodes that are dispersed in the environment. The key idea of this system uses MANET environments to publicize the truths by increasing the data transmission rate. This influences to changed security problems such as collision, conflict et cetera. These problems would decrease the scattering of the packet ratio. In the preceding research method Interference Avoidance using CoEfficient of Restitution Measure (IA-CERM) is accomplished. This would compute the ``restitution'' of a collision of a node that is accomplished due to discovering the incoming packets from above one node by opening up this calculation, mounting enhanced route could be accomplished by reducing the interference effect. On the other hand these techniques are short of from the interference all through the subsistence of various paths existence. This is solved in the presented research methodology by proposing the new research methodology called as Multi-Path Interference aware Route Path Establishment (MP-IRPE). In this stage, dynamic analysis route behavior is carried out to discover the route path breakage priory. The non-interfering numerous paths will be chosen parallel while the data's broadcasting via the principal path to avoid the path breakage. Therefore the instantaneous re-routing could be carried out without delay; consequently the waiting time could be minimized significantly. In this work optimal routing is done with the consideration of multiple QoS parameters using pareto-optimal approach as like in our previous work QoS and interference aware routing in dynamic MANET. The QoS parameters considered are ``bandwidth, power, delay, link stability and reliability''. The whole assessment of the research method is performed and executed in the NS2 simulation environment. So, it is shown that the proposed methodology give improved result compared to the existing techniques. While comparing with other familiar protocols, MP-IRPE gives fine qualities in relation to overhead latency, and packet losses. In addition, these outcomes end to be relatively self-sufficient from the degree of mobility.",

The emerging energy harvesting technology, allowing devices to harvest energy from external sources automatically without human intervention, is promisingly applied to M2M communications networks, which can therefore operate permanently. However, currently available IEEE 802.11 protocols do not consider supporting energy-harvesting devices efficiently. Our research focuses effort in enhancing IEEE 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) with widely-deployed numerous devices powered by energy-harvesting modules so as to realize an energy-efficient M2M communications network. We propose DeepSleep with the aim of improving energy-efficiency and reducing the overall outage probability, application layer loss rate and collision probability. The effectiveness of DeepSleep is demonstrated by NS-2 platform. An analytical model is provided to select DeepSleep parameters. Applying DeepSleep, an energy-harvesting device can have less energy wastage on idle listening and overhearing, and have a higher channel access priority when waking up from a relatively longer period of sleeping. In addition, the channel access fairness is considered in DeepSleep design. In addition, all devices benefit when DeepSleep and 802.11 PSM co-exist in the network, which implies DeepSleep has potential to be deployed in existing WLANs.",

abstract="Understanding crowd behavior using automated video analytics is a relevant research problem in recent times due to complex challenges in monitoring large gatherings. From an automated video surveillance perspective, estimation of crowd density in particular regions of the video scene is an indispensable tool in understanding crowd behavior. Crowd density estimation provides the measure of number of people in a given region at a specified time. While most of the existing computer vision methods use supervised training to arrive at density estimates, we propose an approach to estimate crowd density using motion cues and hierarchical clustering. The proposed method incorporates optical flow for motion estimation, contour analysis for crowd silhouette detection, and clustering to derive the crowd density.

abstract="In the agricultural domain, proper storage conditions of crops is important to avoid losses due to degradation of crop quality. Currently, monitoring storages is often done manually and by using only a few samples. This makes the process time-consuming and in many cases the few samples taken cannot ensure a good overview of the entire storage. This paper describes the challenges of providing a good network coverage, sufficient network lifetime, a physical design able to cope with the harsh environments met in deployments, and cost. How these challenges were approached in the development of a wireless sensor network based system that provides continuous, automatic, and up-to-date information on a crop storage, while presenting the data in an easily accessible manner, is also described. The design decisions, challenges, and practical experiences from real-world large scale deployment of the system are also discussed. It is concluded that the network works well for the intended application and that the intended users also see a value in the provided service.",

journal="Wireless Networks",

abstract="The key management has a fundamental role in securing group communications taking place over vast and unprotected networks. It is concerned with the distribution and update of the keying materials whenever any changes occur in the group membership. Wireless mobile environments enable members to move freely within the networks, which causes more difficulty to design efficient and scalable key management protocols. This is partly because both member location dynamic and group membership dynamic must be managed concurrently, which may lead to significant rekeying overhead. This paper presents a hierarchical group key management scheme taking the mobility of members into consideration intended for wireless mobile environments. The proposed scheme supports the mobility of members across wireless mobile environments while remaining in the group session with minimum rekeying transmission overhead. Furthermore, the proposed scheme alleviates 1-affect-n phenomenon, single point of failure, and signaling load caused by moving members at the core network. Simulation results shows that the scheme surpasses other existing efforts in terms of communication overhead and affected members. The security requirements studies also show the backward and forward secrecy is preserved in the proposed scheme even though the members move between areas.",

Load balanced clustering effectively organize the network into a connected hierarchy. Clustering is a discrete problem that can have more than one solution under different operating constraints. In this scenario, meta-heuristic algorithms are found suitable because they give set of solutions in acceptable time constraints. In the literature, several analytical and meta-heuristic approaches have been developed for load balanced clustering. In this paper, a novel harmony search based energy efficient load balanced clustering algorithm is presented and it is tested on a large sample network. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach has faster convergence and gives reliable and efficient load balanced clustering as compared to conventional harmony search algorithm (HSA) and several other methods in the literature. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed approach is also verified for different cases of fixed and variable parameters of HSA.",

abstract="Video streaming over Internet has been gaining momentum and several quality adaptation schemes have been reported to improve quality of the streamed videos. Most of these schemes focus on adjusting the video encoding rate to match certain network conditions. This paper presents a new quality adaptation algorithm for real-time video streaming over Internet. The proposed algorithm is based upon simultaneous adaptation of multiple key parameters such as video frame rate, resolution, and frame quality to achieve the best possible video quality and minimize possibility of service interruption in lossy networks. Furthermore, the current network status and motion of the streamed video sequence have also been taken into account throughout the adaptation process. A video conferencing test-bed which incorporates the Adobe Flash Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP) is built and utilized to investigate the effect of various combinations of the video parameters under study on the quality of sample video clips streamed at slow, medium and fast motions. A quality-adaptation algorithm based on experimental investigations is then developed and its performance is assessed using both subjective and objective evaluations. The obtained results and observations demonstrate superior performance of the developed adaptation algorithm as compared to equivalent algorithms with fixed video quality settings at similar test conditions.",

However, testing and debugging of each product, even from the same family, is still done independently. This can be very expensive. To solve this problem, we need to explore how test cases generated for one product can be used for another product. We propose a genetic algorithm-based framework which integrates software fault localization techniques and focuses on reusing test specifications and input values whenever feasible. Case studies using four software product lines and eight fault localization techniques were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Discussions on factors that may affect the effectiveness of the proposed framework is also presented. Our results indicate that test cases generated in such a way can be easily reused (with appropriate conversion) between different products of the same family and help reduce the overall testing and debugging cost.",

abstract="The 60 GHz unlicensed frequency band has been adopted to support high data rate WLAN applications. The problem of this frequency band is that the wireless signal is vulnerable to the shadowing of objects. Especially in indoor scenarios, humans may frequently block the signal paths that cause disconnections of devices. This problem can be mitigated by using multiple antennas that can create rich signal paths between the devices. The idea presented in this paper is to employ a distributed antenna system (DAS) architecture enabled by radio-over-fiber technology to alleviate the shadowing problem. In the DAS architecture, multiple remote antenna units (RAUs), each of them equipped with an antenna array, are connected with the same WLAN access points via optical fibers. But there are questions that need to be answered, including the beamforming strategy with multiple RAUs, and the placement and the required number of the RAUs. These questions are related to factors like room size, population density, etc. We discuss these questions in this paper and present our findings through theoretical models and extensive simulations, which can be referred to for practical implementations. We find that the proposed 60 GHz DAS can significantly improve the link connectivity. Even when only two RAUs are used, the signal coverage can be improved to an acceptable percentage in heavy shadowing scenarios.",

abstract="Efficient key establishment is an important problem for secure group communications. The communication and storage complexity of group key establishment problem has been studied extensively. In this paper, we propose a new group key establishment protocol whose computation complexity is significantly reduced. Instead of using classic secret sharing, the protocol only employs a linear secret sharing scheme, using Vandermonde Matrix, to distribute group key efficiently. This protocol drastically reduces the computation load of each group member and maintains at least the same security degree compared to existing schemes employing traditional secret sharing. The security strength of this scheme is evaluated in detail. Such a protocol is desirable for many wireless applications where portable devices or sensors need to reduce their computation as much as possible due to battery power limitations. This protocol provides much lower computation complexity while maintaining low and balanced communication complexity and storage complexity for secure group key establishment.",

abstract="Nowadays, complex smartphone applications are developed that support gaming, navigation, video editing, augmented reality, and speech recognition which require considerable computational power and battery lifetime. The cloud computing provides a brand new opportunity for the development of mobile applications. Mobile Hosts (MHs) are provided with data storage and processing services on a cloud computing platform rather than on the MHs. To provide seamless connection and reliable cloud service, we are focused on communication. When the connection to cloud server is increased explosively, each MH connection quality has to be declined. It causes several problems: network delay, retransmission, and so on. In this paper, we propose proxy based architecture to improve link performance for each MH in mobile cloud computing. By proposed proxy, the MH need not keep connection of the cloud server because it just connected one of proxy in the same subnet. And we propose the optimal access network discovery algorithm to optimize bandwidth usage. When the MH changes its point of attachment, proposed discovery algorithm helps to connect the optimal access network for cloud service. By experiment result and analysis, the proposed connection management method has better performance than the 802.11 access method.",

Emotion-aware mobile computing utilizes mobile and computing technology to detect the affective state of a person. It is a new active research area and will bring many attractive applications and services with the development of 5G. Emotion-aware mobile computing has two main veins: analysis and computation. With the support of big data and cloud computing technology, mobile users are able to obtain better performance in terms of resource intensive service. The whole process of emotion-aware mobile computing requires data collection, data transmission, data analysis, data cognition, and emotion-aware action feedback. In order to detect the accurate emotion, massive data are required to be processed in each step. Therefore, the energy consumption is not an ignorable issue in this technology. In this paper, a framework of energy efficient emotion-aware mobile computing system is proposed. It considers the energy saving from both local user part and remote data centers part. In the local user part, the energy efficient data transmission approach is introduced while in the remote data centers part, the renewable energy based geo-distributed data centers are considered. The results from the analysis demonstrate that the proposed framework is useful to provide energy saving while keeping quality of service (QoS).",

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) models fluid behaviors at the microscopic scale, similar to the information diffusion in social media that is determined by the collective behavior of many personal retweeting of topics. We propose an information diffusion model inspired by the fundamental idea of LBM to analyze and simulate users' communicating behaviors and processes in Micro-blogging. The micro-blog space is regarded as an artificial physical system with social phenomena such as micro-blog bursting. The macroscopic properties of the information diffusion model are explored to simulate and predict the trend of information diffusion for any specific topic. A novel visualization style mimicking fluid dynamics is proposed to help understand the scale of information diffusion and the popularity of a topic. The flow visualization based on the speed of information diffusion is useful in discovering typical information diffusion patterns for different types of topics in social networks.

abstract="Age estimation has been widely used and became more and more important, for its usefulness in various applications. However, accurately predict the age for an unlabeled image is difficult, because there are many factors that have impact on the appearance of a person. Some people look younger than his/her true age, while the others look much older. Therefore, predict an age group or a specific age for a facial image is not good enough. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the age of facial image into a dynamic range or a discrete age set rather than a single age or age group. Furthermore, we introduce a new measurement, i.e. Confidence Interval/Confidence Level to evaluate the performance of proposed method.

abstract="In time driven applications we are often bound to make a keen compromise between the sampling resolution (or sampler architecture) and available resources. This is especially true in WSNs (Wireless Sensor NetworkS), although the complexity of event driven environments present us new opportunities for optimizations. In this paper we propose a multi resolution sampling protocol for event driven WSNs that can dynamically adapt to event signatures and can efficiently schedule resource intensive samplers. The system can monitor the environment by a resource optimized sampler which is only to detect events and not to store or process any samples. When scheduled the high resolution sampler is activated to sample the appropriate physical property of the phenomenon marked by the event, via resolution optimized hardware. Since it takes time to detect an event (triggered by the signal we already ought to sample) and to power up the high resolution, resource intensive sampler, we must start the sampling before the signal is detected. This calls for dynamic event forecasting, which is the main feature of the proposed system.",

abstract="Advanced communication systems, such as long term evolution (LTE) and LTE-advanced (LTE-A) systems, promise to increase the number of users with high-speed data exchange. However, it leads to spectrum scarcity because of the huge size of data exchange with limited spectrum resources. Cognitive radio (CR) technique is considered the best solution for this spectrum scarcity problem. Spectrum sensing (SS), one of the CR techniques is used to detect the spectrum hole of primary user (PU) without interference with PU. In this paper, several SS approaches for LTE and LTE-A systems are investigated in the CR system. These SS approaches are based on two techniques, namely energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection techniques. The first technique includes four approaches of auto-correlation based advanced energy, time domain detection, Welch periodogram and two-stage model algorithms, while the second technique contains two approaches, namely pilot induced cyclostationary and second order cyclostationary algorithms. According to the analysis, the two-stage model and the second order cyclostationary algorithms are better than the other algorithms because they produce accurate results at the expense of system complexity. Hence, in general a good SS algorithms would require some trade-off between complexity and accuracy.",

In this paper, a honeycomb structure based data gathering scheme, HSDG, is proposed for wireless sensor networks with a mobile sink. By partitioning the network into a honeycomb structure and giving each partition a direction value, every sensor node can obtain the latest location of the mobile sink dynamically with a small amount of broadcasting overhead. HSDG uncouples the moving strategy of mobile sink from the data forwarding mechanism, and three subscheme HSDG{\_}RM, HSDG{\_}DGM, and HSDG{\_}EGM are proposed. Our schemes are investigated from average energy consumption, maintenance cost, packet loss rate and the number of packets collected.

abstract="Recently, several industrial studies have concluded that compliance management is one of the major challenges companies face nowadays. In practice, runtime compliance monitoring is of utmost importance for compliance assurance as during the design-time compliance checking phase, only a subset of the imposed compliance requirements can be statically checked due to the absence of required variable instantiation and contextual information. Furthermore, the fact that a business process model has been statically checked for compliance during design-time does not guarantee that the corresponding running business process instances are usually compliant due to human and machine errors. The problem of runtime monitoring of business process compliance becomes more challenging when business processes are executed in cloud computing environments. In this context, the compliance process can not rely on external components as the whole execution environment is mainly controlled by the cloud providers. In this article, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem by adopting and configuring the business process models into a form that augment the associated compliance rules so that they can be monitored without the need to rely on external monitoring components. Compared to approaches that depend on an external monitoring component, our approach requires less sophisticated infrastructure when hosted on the cloud as well as less traffic footprint as communication with an external component for monitoring is no longer needed.",

abstract="Recommender systems have been one of the most prominent information filtering techniques during the past decade. However, they suffer from two major problems, which degrade the accuracy of suggestions: data sparsity and cold start. The popularity of social networks shed light on a new generation of such systems, which is called social recommender system. These systems act promisingly in solving data sparsity and cold start issues. Given that social relationships are not available to every system, the implicit relationship between the items can be an adequate option to replace the constraints. In this paper, we explored the effect of combining the implicit relationships of the items and user-item matrix on the accuracy of recommendations. The new Item Asymmetric Correlation (IAC) method detects the implicit relationship between each pair of items by considering an asymmetric correlation among them. Two dataset types, the output of IAC and user-item matrix, are fused into a collaborative filtering recommender via Matrix Factorization (MF) technique. We apply the two mostly used mapping models in MF, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Alternating Least Square, to investigate their performances in the presence of sparse data. The experimental results of real datasets at four levels of sparsity demonstrate the better performance of our method comparing to the other commonly used approaches, especially in handling the sparse data.",

abstract="In wireless sensor networks (WSN), nodes usually use multi-hop communication to transmit sensed data to the base station. Consequently, sensors near the sink deplete their energy quickly and the sink will be isolated from the network. Moving the sink all around the network can alleviate this problem. Yet, sink mobility causes some challenging issues in WSNs which makes it almost impossible to use the classic routing protocols of WSNs with static sink. Therefore, it is required to develop new routing protocols or extend the existing ones. This paper presents an energy-efficient hybrid routing method for WSNs with mobile sink that combines proactive and reactive schemes. Our model is also applicable to the battlefield with a vehicle as the mobile sink. The primary objective of the proposed method is to increase the lifetime of sensor networks by reducing control messages and average hop counts, different traffic patterns flexibility and the protocol usability for most applications. The proposed method suggests several new algorithms to fulfill its purposes. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method extends the network lifetime from 5 to 9 {\%} compared to the existing techniques. A distinguishing attribute of this method is the decreased amount of control message overhead compared with similar approaches.",

In this paper, we propose a sensor deployment scheme, which can achieve full coverage of the monitoring area and prolong network lifetime. We consider a real world situation where the initial energy of the sensors is different from each other. First, to achieve full coverage using as few sensors as possible, we compute the average angle between the sensor nodes. Then, we provide two methods to achieve energy balance. In the first method, we propose a sweep-based scheme to move the sensors as requested. In the second method, we transform the deployment problem into the multiple knapsack problem and based on ant colony optimization algorithm, we propose a deployment strategy to improve the network lifetime.",

Further- more, a captured sensor node might generate a fictitious data and misguide the Sink (BS). Hence, secure communication between nodes have generally vital importance. Secret shared keys are needed to be established among sensor nodes for secure communication among them. In the present work a new algorithm is introduced to construct such a tree of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. This algorithm implements a sleep/wake scheduling technique to keep redundant nodes inactive while maintaining initial sensing coverage with active nodes. Redundant nodes can replace the failure nodes to keep network tasks that enhances the network lifetime by efficient utilization. Hence the objective of this research work is to jointly design the scheme for sensor scheduling, tree construction with active nodes, and secret pair-wise keys establishment with their parent and children such that the network lifetime can be maximized.

abstract="A major drawback of signature-based intrusion detection systems is the inability to detect novel attacks that do not match the known signatures already stored in the database. Anomaly detection is a kind of intrusion detection in which the activities of a system are monitored and these activities are classified as normal or anomalous based on their expected behavior. Tree-based classifiers have been successfully used to separate the abnormal behavior from the normal one. Tree pruning is a machine learning technique used to minimize the size of a decision tree (DT) in order to reduce the complexity of the classifier and improve its predictive accuracy. In this paper, we attempt to prune a DT using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and apply it to the network intrusion detection problem. The proposed technique is a hybrid approach in which PSO is used for node pruning and the pruned DT is used for classification of the network intrusions. Both single and multi-objective PSO algorithms are used in the proposed approach. The experiments are carried out on the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. This dataset has been widely used as a benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection problems. The results of the proposed technique are compared to the other state-of-the-art classifiers and it is observed that the proposed technique performs better than the other classifiers in terms of intrusion detection rate, false positive rate, accuracy, and precision.",

abstract="The forest fire occurs every year and brings huge losses to human life and property. How to predict the trend of forest fire accurately for commanders to make decisions in a very short period of time, has become a hot issue of research in recent years. In many cases, temporal and spatial variation of wind direction and wind speed become the main factors in affecting the spread of forest fire. Research on local wind field in micro scale is helpful to improve the accuracy of the prediction of forest fire spreading, but in reality, the data provided by meteorological department are large scale wind field data. Micro scale of the local wind field data mostly rely on the speculation based on the experience of people. So the system which can transform the large scale wind field data to the micro scale local wind field data to improve the prediction accuracy of forest fire spreading is especially necessary. In this paper, according to the characteristics of the near surface wind field we calculate the wind speed by the wind profile, get differential of wind direction of each grid position through the diagnosis of the wind field model, so as to realize the finer micro scale wind field in the complex topography. Wind field and forest fire model can be displayed in real time visualization platform. In the final of this paper, we selected multiple fire cases contained with the southern typical fire cases which have the complete data as the research object to analyze, and have implemented the simulation of forest fire inversion in the self-developed software FFSimulator v1. 0. The simulation of local wind field, fixed wind field and the no wind field forest fire are conducted under the conditions of the same terrain and the same combustible material. With the comparison of simulation results and the case study of forest fire burning area and spread edges, the experimental results show that the simulation using local wind field data of forest fire is more accurate in forecasting the trend of fire spreading, and can provide more favorable reference for making fire prevention and fire fighting decisions and transportation planning in forest.",

In this study, an energy-balanced strategy that contributes to redistributing energy consumption of the network is proposed for WSNs through the innovative use of complex networks synchronization theory. The betweenness centrality in complex networks is used to measure the importance of the node in the network. Constructing energy consumption synchronization functions and decreasing the maximum betweenness of the node in this study improves the synchronization capacity of energy consumption and weakens the effect of key nodes on the performance of the network, the effect of key edges is also investigated in this study. Experiment results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed strategy delays the appearance of the first death node, therefore prolongs the lifetime of the network effectively and helps achieve balance in the energy consumption of nodes.",

abstract="A novel crystal oscillator circuit with differential quadrature outputs is presented in this paper. It couples two differential Pierce structures with an annular cascade structure to realize differential quadrature outputs directly. A prototype of the circuit was fabricated in SMIC 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS process technology. The measurement results show that the maximum quadrature phase mismatch of adjoining signals is lower than 1.3{\textdegree} and the maximum amplitude mismatch is less than 1 {\%}. Compared to the conventional quadrature signal implementations such as poly phase filter network, or a current mode logic divider, our proposed circuit can directly achieve differential quadrature outputs with much better phase noise and excellent differential quadrature matching. It proves potential application prospect in many radio frequency transceiver systems which require rigorous matching characteristics of differential quadrature local oscillator for excellent performance of image rejection.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) located in certain environments may get segregated into disjoint segments due to breakdown of one or more sensor nodes. This results in the failure of the entire network. It is necessary to restore the connectivity among the disjoint segments to ensure the accuracy of the data collected by the sink node. Relay nodes (RNs) aid in improving network life time and reducing the data latency. We can ensure full connectivity of the network by positioning relay nodes at certain locations in the deployment area. Therefore optimal relay nodes locations need to be identified to design a fully connected WSN. In this paper, we use moth flame optimizer (MFO) algorithm, interior search algorithm (ISA) and bat algorithm (BA) to identify the optimal positions for the placement of RNs. The proposed work uses the heuristic fully connected network to check the connectivity of the network. Extensive simulations have been carried out and the results show the superiority of MFO compared to BA, ISA and minimum spanning tree based M1tRNP approach.",

abstract="Collision problem is critical for the performance of coexisting Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). This paper presents a collision analysis of CSMA/CA based MAC protocol in the view of collision probability under duty cycled superframe structure. Firstly, we discuss two types of chief collisions at a micro level (i.e., staggered collisions and direct collisions) in the presence of hidden and exposed terminals, respectively. Then we discuss various direct collisions between RTS/CTS frames in slotted CSMA/CA. Furthermore, we highlight a special type of direct collisions which can neither be detected by interfering nodes nor discovered before the collisions of DATAs (i.e., indiscoverable collisions). A hypothesis, several propositions and conclusions are presented to explain which is the domination of the collisions and how the direct collisions are released. Numerical results verify our conclusions and confirm that the indiscoverable collisions turn out to be another key issue in coexisting WBANs. The simulation in mobile environment with time-varying traffic is carried out to show the impact of collisions on network performance. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive collision analysis at the micro level for the evolution of CSMA/CA based MAC protocol and the first estimation of indiscoverable collisions in duty cycled WBANs.",

The obtained experimental results by using real world wireless sensor network nodes are proposed as a complement to the simulation results, previously measured in the Network Simulator 2 `NS-2', in order to prove these improvements from a practical point of view. We introduced a new mechanism to the proposed protocol in order to meet the memory constraint. The goal is to protect the time critical data from being dropped when the coordinator queue is full.

Only the two are matched can a receiver decrypt the ciphertexts and verify whether it is from valid data signer. We introduce key insulation mechanism into our scheme by dividing the system lifetime into several time periods. When key exposure happens, the system will evolve into the next time period to preserve the forward security. We eliminate bilinear parings in our KI-CP-ABSC thus the computation burden on the terminal devices are reduced sharply.

The method first obtains a proper initial threshold based on Bayes decision theory to ensure accurate initial segmentation, and then an adaptation mechanism is designed to automatically adjust the threshold to improve user-dependent accuracy. A dataset of over 1,200 samples from 12 gestures and 25 subjects is created for evaluation.

abstract="Lifetime enhancement has been the major constraint of developing wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Most of previous related works separately considered dynamics and heterogeneity of WSNs, and did not consider energy-harvesting (EH) sensors, which can absorb natural power (e.g., solar and wind power) to extend lifetime of sensor devices. Therefore, this work investigates the problem of extending the lifetime of dynamic heterogeneous WSNs with EH sensors to enhancing the total WSN lifetime. This problem can be characterized as finding the maximal number of covers each of which is a part of all sensors so that all targets can be monitored by these sensors. Since the case for static WSNs has been shown to be NP-complete, the concerned problem is also NP-complete. Hence, this work first models this problem mathematically, and then proposes a novel harmony search algorithm with multiple populations and local search (HSAML) for this problem with dynamics, heterogeneity, and EH sensors. By simulation, the network lifetime, stability, and executing time of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. From experimental results, the proposed HSAML performs better than the conventional algorithm in terms of average network lifetime for larger-scale problems (i.e., when the number of common and EH sensors is small). In addition, the results confirm that adding EH sensors really helps extend the total WSN lifetime.",

FLI provides a fuzzy linearization of the building map hence the creation of a fuzzy linguistic model of the system.

A Sugeno type-0 fuzzy inference system is proposed and submitted to a supervised learning through the neuro-fuzzy ANFIS algorithm.

abstract="The need to implement techniques to monitor optical fiber links in passive optical networks (PONs), based on the principle of reflectometry, has motivated various research projects. Such studies are especially important for networks with tree topology or hierarchical topology, due to the difficulty to determine in which specific fiber branch there was rupture. This work proposes a novel model based on fiber Bragg grating to solve the complexity in the monitoring of point-multipoint networks. This mode uses multiple access techniques by division of optical codes in phase, to monitor the PONs. The work involved developing a novel PON monitoring model to detect fiber optic branches with problems that are analyzed by means of autocorrelation of optical pulses reflected by Bragg gratings. These Bragg gratings are strategically arranged in network terminal units. The results obtained through simulations demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach applied in Bragg grating 63 chips for identifies fault, in real time, in the network with 8, 16, 32 or 63 users. The system satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to monitor PONs, using fewer Bragg gratins and couplers, compared to the other models found in the literature, such as fault location in passive optical networks using T-Optical time-domain reflectometer and wavelength-selective isolators, remote coding scheme based on waveguide Bragg grating in power line communication splitter chip for PONs monitoring, optimal fiber link fault decision for optical 2D coding-monitoring scheme in passive optical networks, and centralized PONs monitoring scheme based on optical coding.",

In this distributed approach and in contrast to centralized schemes, each node periodically exchanges the local clock reading with its immediate neighbor nodes. Then, each node employs these time informations to calculate its relative offset and skew with respect to its neighbor nodes using a weighted average consensus based technique.

abstract="Pulse shaping is used in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based systems to reduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) power and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which are considered the major weaknesses in OFDM-based systems. A novel family of Nyquist-I pulses called sinc exponential pulse (SEP) is proposed, and it is characterized by two new design parameters that provide extra degrees of freedom for a certain roll-off factor, $\alpha$. SEP effectively decreases the relative magnitude of the two largest side lobes of the SEP frequency function, which minimizes the ICI power and reduces the PAPR in OFDM systems. Furthermore, the SEP possesses a broader main lobe, which provides sufficient improvement in bit-error-rate (BER). The behavior of the SEP is examined in the time and frequency domain by tuning its design parameters to obtain the sub-optimum SEP. Theoretical and simulation results show that the sub-optimum SEP performs better than other existing pulses in terms of ICI power, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) power, BER, and PAPR in OFDM-based systems.",

The consumers in each interest-group share some relevant preferences which guarantee that the interest-group as a whole satisfies some desired properties of similarity. As a result, forming these interest-groups requires the availability of personal data of different consumers. This is a crucial requirement for different recommender systems. With the increasing trend of service providers to collect a large volume of personal data regarding their end-users, presumably to better serve them. However, a significant part of the data that is typically collected is not essential to the service being offered, or to the completion of the services it was presumably released for. Gathering such unnecessary data can be seen as a privacy threat, and storing it exposes the end-users to further unavoidable risks. In this paper, a privacy aware group based recommender system is proposed for the automated discovery of appropriate interest groups in multimedia services. A fog based middleware (FMCP) was introduced that runs at end-users' sides and allows exchanging of their information to facilities recommending and creating interest-groups without disclosing their real preferences to other consumers. The membership of consumers in various interest groups allows receiving highly appropriate and reliable multimedia content-related advices. The system utilizes two protocols to attain this goal.

Due to its better performance in monitoring the target environment, MMSN has already been applied to many fields and scenarios. However, MMSN also faces with various security threatens and data privacy is one issue urgently to be solved. In this paper, we propose an attribute based encryption scheme to guarantee the secure data sharing in MMSN. In our scheme, a user can only get access to the encrypted multimedia data if his private key satisfies with the access structure. We divide the system lifetime of MMSN into discrete time periods and embed the current time period information into user's private key. When time evolves, only part of the private key has to be updated and the system public parameters remain unchanged. This can reduce the key-updating computation cost and minimize the energy consumption for system parameter transmission when attribute revocation or private key exposure happens. By security proof and efficiency analysis, we prove our scheme is confidential and of higher efficiency, which makes it more appropriate for secure data protection in MMSN.",

abstract="Quality of service (QoS)-adaptive service configuration is crucial for seamless access to video services in cloud-assisted video surveillance systems. To maintain seamless access to video on a user's preferred device, suitable video transcoding services are needed. It is a challenging task to choose and configure these services for various devices to ensure QoS-adaptive user experiences. To configure these services for the desired user devices, a suitable configuration algorithm is needed. Therefore, this paper describes a QoS-adaptive service configuration approach to choose the optimal configuration for the preferred user devices in varied contexts so that the user can access the services ubiquitously. We implemented a cloud-assisted video surveillance prototype to show how the proposed method can handle ubiquitous access to target video for possible QoS-adaptive and video processing requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, and frame rates. The results show that the proposed configuration method outperforms the other comparable approaches.",

The proposed technique is based on the use of directional motion history images (DMHIs), which is an extension of the popular optical-flow method for object tracking. Zernike moments of each DMHI are computed in order to perform the classification. The technique incorporates automatic temporal segmentation of isolated utterances. The segmentation of isolated utterance is achieved using pair-wise pixel comparison. Support vector machine is used for classification and the results are based on leave-one-out paradigm. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves better performance in visemes recognition than others reported in literature. The benefit of this proposed visual speech recognition method is that it is suitable for real-time applications due to quick motion tracking system and the fast classification method employed. It has applications in command and control using lip movement to text conversion and can be used in noisy environment and also for assisting speech impaired persons.",

Results show that five patterns are obtained and annotated as traffic, industrial, residential, commercial, and steady ones. Each type owns special characteristics on time basis or day basis. Furthermore, calculating the reconstruction correlation of tensors with respect to sites, time, and days approximately approaches to 0.95--0.96, and it can be employed with high evaluation values of the model.

Using many replications of a relatively small number of the most popular items a significant performance improvement can be achieved. Our method was verified using real video streaming data taken from traces of live content distribution networks. Simulation results show that replicating a relatively small number of video files can significantly reduce the incoming bandwidth from the Internet backbone, as well as the (time) latency for content delivery. The proposed scheme is particularly suitable for IP-based TV services, for which the content popularity can be very often predicted with relatively high accuracy. In addition, we propose a hybrid cache management scheme, in which the cache is partitioned into two components.

abstract="In recent years, high-utility itemset mining has emerged as an important data mining task. However, it remains computationally expensive both in terms of runtime and memory consumption. It is thus an important challenge to design more efficient algorithms for this task. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel algorithm named EFIM (EFficient high-utility Itemset Mining), which introduces several new ideas to more efficiently discover high-utility itemsets. EFIM relies on two new upper bounds named revised sub-tree utility and local utility to more effectively prune the search space. It also introduces a novel array-based utility counting technique named Fast Utility Counting to calculate these upper bounds in linear time and space. Moreover, to reduce the cost of database scans, EFIM proposes efficient database projection and transaction merging techniques named High-utility Database Projection and High-utility Transaction Merging (HTM), also performed in linear time. An extensive experimental study on various datasets shows that EFIM is in general two to three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-art algorithms                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}d{\}}^2{\$}{\$}                                                                                    d                        2                                                                            HUP, HUI-Miner, HUP-Miner, FHM and UP-Growth+ on dense datasets and performs quite well on sparse datasets.

The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user's preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation.",

abstract="This study suggests to use popularity based caching for IP-based TV (IPTV) services over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Each peer in a P2P network can use two levels of cache hierarchy: an internal cache and a neighboring peer cache. Using this property, our main focus is on caching the globally most popular video files nearby the clients, in order to reduce the IPTV service delay, increase the quality of service provided to the clients, and reduce the traffic over the Internet backbone. The proposed framework was applied on real data traces from live P2P networks. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the Least Recently Used (LRU) and the Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache management schemes. This study is motivated by the vision of large P2P networks consisting of many volunteers serving as peers, each of which has a relatively small cache size, in terms of the number of video items it can store. Since the performance of both the LRU and LFU schemes is very poor for small cache, there is a need for another cache management scheme, which outperforms these schemes, especially for small cache size. The proposed distributed popularity-based caching scheme can significantly increase the performance of P2P networks used for video streaming, with respect to the existing networks, that use the LRU or LFU schemes. The performance metric used for comparison is the cache hit ratio and the expected delay for content delivery. In both parameters a significant improvement is demonstrated.",

The majority of the existing signals detection and classification methods presume that the received signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The performance of the modulation classification algorithms degrades severely under the non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a robust algorithm to identify the modulation type of digital signal contaminated with non-Gaussian impulse noise and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) using a sparse signal decomposition on hybrid dictionary. The algorithm first detects and removes the impulse noise using sparse signal decomposition thereafter it classifies the modulation schemes using cyclostationary feature extraction algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method under different non-Gaussian impulse noise and AWGN conditions. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated using well known classifiers available in the literature.",

To find similar cells from a OpenSlide file, we have to use high performance computer equiped with multi-core and large size memory. In this paper, we propose a method to find similar cell images with resource limited computer. For this purpose, we exploit several technique to minimize system resource requirement and adapt imaging process scheme that enhances the accuracy of finding similar cell images from a OpenSlide file. We adapt a leveling, tiling and sub tiling to the OpenSlide file and extracting the feature points accurately using the hybrid feature extracting algorithm that adapts advantages of ORB and Blob algorithm.

In the medical image processing community, image super-resolution has been playing a vital role to make the computer based diagnosis more efficient and accurate. Resolution enhancement through conventional interpolation methods strongly affects the precision of consequent processing steps such as segmentation and registration. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized K-SVD dictionary learning based medical image super-resolution algorithm. First, the dictionary is trained using the modified version of the K-SVD dictionary learning procedure. The sparse coding phase of the K-SVD dictionary learning scheme is then enhanced incorporating a simple and an efficient regularized version of orthogonal matching pursuit. In addition, the dictionary update stage allows for an arbitrary number of atoms at the same time and sparse coefficient vector. In the SR reconstruction procedure, ROMP is adopted to find out for the vector of sparse representation coefficients for the underlying patch. In the final part, mathematical optimization finalizes the SR work effectively. The numerical analysis and experimental simulation prove the feasibility and robustness of our proposed methodology compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

abstract="A wideband single-ended input and differential output low noise amplifier (LNA) employing the common-gate (CG) common-source (CS) structure is presented. The output of the CS transistor is utilized to boost the effective transconductance of the CG stage. The gain balance won't be affected by the g                        m-boosting stage, because its gain is constant, and independent of process, voltage, and temperature. The composite CS stage, consisting of two parts, is first proposed to cancel the gain imbalance induced by the back-gate effect. The first part of the CS transistors employs the body-coupling technique, and the other part are the conventional CS transistors. For a proof-of-concept, the proposed balun-LNA is fabricated in a 0.13 $\mu$m CMOS process. The frequency band of the circuit is 0.5--3.7 GHz. The measured in-band average and maximum gain imbalance are 0.34, 0.7 dB, respectively. The phase imbalance range is −1{\textdegree} to 5{\textdegree}. A noise figure of 3.7--6.2 dB, and a minimum IIP3 of −7.1 dBm are obtained. Good input/output matching are achieved through the frequency band. The LNA consumes a power of 10.2 mW from a 1.5 V supply.",

abstract="Automatic modulation classification plays a key role in cognitive radio for recognizing the modulation scheme. In this paper, we propose a new classifier based on sparse signal decomposition using an overcomplete composite dictionary (constructed using cyclostationary coefficients) for the classification of modulation format of primary user or to identify noise. The basic principle of the classifier is to classify the received signal modulation format based on reconstructed sparse coefficients after solving                                                                           {\$}{\$}l{\_}1{\$}{\$}                                                                                    l                        1                                                                             norm minimization using the overcomplete dictionary. Then, relative energies of reconstructed sparse coefficients are compared for recognition of modulation format of the received signal. It is a promising candidate for the cognitive radio due to its robust classification ability. The performance of the proposed classifier is compared with other well known classifiers available in literature. Results show the superiority of the proposed classifier over other classifiers.",

abstract="In the modern society, the forms of disasters are getting larger and more diverse by abnormal weather phenomena due to rapid social changes. As human and economic damage is increasing by these disasters, interest in disaster observation and prevention is increasing and studies have been carried out in various fields. In order to minimize disaster damage, National Disaster Information Center provides disaster-related information such as disaster situations, risk index, local situation and so on. At present, however, various descriptive studies on action tips in the event of a disaster, disaster alert, disaster communications network have been in progress but there are few studies on prediction or simulation for preventing disasters etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a slope-based intelligent 3D disaster simulation using a physics engine. The proposed method is to infer a variety of disaster situations that may occur in reality through ontology and apply it to 3D simulation. Disaster situation ontology constitutes context information of outside, inside, disasters etc. and generates rule bases using Jena 2.0 inference engine. Inference results are derived in the form of XML and applicable to a variety of devices. The expression of 3D simulation virtual space is divided into interior and exterior. Interior constitutes the index information based on actually measured terrain and then expresses it into 3D compound type terrain data. Exterior expresses six planes into a hexahedron by using Sky Box technique. Simulation operates object collision, movement, surroundings etc. in real time by using a physics engine and represents a disaster situation in 3D virtual space by using particles function. Based on ontology based context awareness, environment context information on slope, including landslides, snow, rain, fogs, fire, explosion, and smoke, is developed into the slope based intelligent 3D disaster simulation. As a result, depending on geomorphic characteristics, disaster management service can realistically and visually be offered to users in 3D virtual reality. In addition, it is possible to experimentally apply disaster situations virtually through 3D virtual reality, and thereby judge their potential risk.",
