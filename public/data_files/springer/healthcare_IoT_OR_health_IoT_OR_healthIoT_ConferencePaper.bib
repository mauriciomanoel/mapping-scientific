abstract="As Internet of Things (IoT) is entering mainstream, data privacy and security in information exchange becomes a major concern and a barrier for potential adopters, especially in healthcare regime. Information from health IoT devices and services is sensitive and confidential. While many existing works have proposed enhancements and security prospects for individual devices and components in IoT ecosystems, they still do not address the underlying challenge which is the lack of sufficient security within systems. Effective security has to be built-in, not patched upon. To efficaciously tackle the challenge in distributed IoT systems, we present a security context framework which applies adaptive security contexts to properly track data of interest. The proposed solution can achieve accountability and track information propagation, involving devices, services and parties who have responsibility and potential legal liability. This could help leverage not just technical but also policy and legal aspects to enable health IoT adoption.",

abstract="Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies present enormous potential for the intensified healthcare support of senior or disabled citizens. Everyday objects will have the capability of directly interacting with each other and with humans. In this context we propose NCeH -- a middleware solution that hides heterogeneity and offers a single common configuration and processing component for all nodes of IoT applications developed on top of it. The middleware is intended for the caring of people with special needs, such as video-vigilance, monitoring and so on, with multi-function, and is currently applied as a prototype in collaboration with cerebral palsy, blind and seniors caring institutions.",

abstract="The health Internet-of-Things (IoTs) applications have motivated to design nanoscale transistor based biosensors. Therefore, in this work, we mainly focus on how emerging transistors such as tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) can be an alternative beyond-CMOS features for biosensor design and to further increase the low power design strategy to enable it for IoT applications. For this purpose, a charge plasma based dielectrically modulated TFET is proposed in this work, where source region is having SiGe material (with Si and Ge composition equal to 0.5) to improve the ON-state current. The charge plasma concept is employed to make the fabrication process simpler and to avoid the random dopant fluctuations (RDFs) and higher thermal budget. The significant improvement in the sensitivity of the proposed dielectrically modulated junctionless (DMJL) TFET biosensor with different dielectric constant and charge density, and a comparison with conventional MOSFET-based sensor enables its potential application for the Health-IoT applications.",

The popularity of intelligent mobile medical devices, wearable bio-medical sensor devices, cloud computing and big data analysis have dramatically changed the usage pattern and business rule of Health-IoT.

In this paper, a comprehensive trustworthy mobile solution based on architecture modeling with fuzzy-set theory towards Health-IoT is proposed. In particular, the solution is an semantics-based and fuzzy set theory mechanism to calculate trustworthiness for every stakeholders in mobility ecosystem for Health-IoT. An analytic methodology is presented backed with theoretical metrics and evaluated experimentally.

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is a game changer for the connected society. Safe and reliable operation of IoT connected devices is of paramount importance and thus, security and privacy is a foundational enabler for IoT. In this paper, we arrive at a synthesis methodology for the IoT and demonstrate how information flow among the connected devices using a three tier architecture enables us to assess the required security and privacy of the IoT based on the given security and privacy capabilities of the components. Our methodology uses a recent information security model called RWFM (Readers-Writers Flow Model) and shows how flexible approaches of synthesis of IoT through frameworks like Django can be integrated to realize the security/privacy requirements of the IoT. We demonstrate how the methodology concretely enables us to derive the constraints to be satisfied by the underlying components and enabled communications. A case study of a healthcare IoT implementation is discussed to illustrate the advantages of the methodology.",

Context awareness plays a critical role in realizing the vision of the IoT, providing rich contextual information that can help the system act more efficiently. Since context in healthcare has its unique characteristics, it is necessary to define an appropriate context aware framework for healthcare IoT applications. We identify this context as perceived in healthcare applications and describe the context aware procedures. We also present an architecture that connects the sensors that measure biometric data with the sensory networks of the environment and the various IoT middleware that reside in the geographical area.

abstract="In twenty-first century, the size and scope of the Internet has been increasing as smart devices have ability to communicate with one device to another and share data over the Internet. This is known as Internet of things (IoT). Scalability of the entire system increases in case of more devices in IoT system. So in IoT system, main challenges are to maintain scalability and throughput. To meet these challenges, various architectures are used for implementing IoT applications such as SOAP-based, RESTful, broker-based SOA architecture. While service-oriented architecture provides system integration, interoperability, business agility. Though service-oriented architecture is mainly used for implementing various IoT applications, it faces some challenges such as security, interoperability, and context awareness. Event-driven service-oriented architecture (EDSOA) is a new architectural style which is an extension of broker-based architecture and most suitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we have tried to cover all these architectures.",

abstract="We present an intelligent data management framework that can facilitate development of highly scalable and mobile healthcare applications for remote monitoring of patients. This is achieved through the use of a global log data abstraction that leverages the storage and processing capabilities of the edge devices and the cloud in a seamless manner. In existing log based storage systems, data is read as fixed size chunks from the cloud to enhance performance. However, in healthcare applications, where the data access pattern of the end users differ widely, this approach leads to unnecessary storage and cost overheads. To overcome these, we propose dynamic log chunking. The experimental results, comparing existing fixed chunking against the H-Plane model, show 13 {\%}--19 {\%} savings in network bandwidth as well as cost while fetching the data from the cloud.",
