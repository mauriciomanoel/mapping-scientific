abstract="The Internet of Things is one of the most promising technical revolutions of our age. The idea of integrating sensors to common objects and linking to the Internet offers a wide range of new possibilities. However, establishing standard communication protocols, storing heterogeneous data and guaranteeing security to the transmitted information need to be studied. As a support, web services have been released to establish the way how web applications interchange information by using XML, JSON or other plain formats. In this paper, we describe a general Back-End solution to store heterogeneous data collected from different sources. We used the stack named ``MEAN'' to program web services, and JSON as the data model to interchange information. On this study, we show the advantage of using JSON and a NoSQL database to integrate different solutions developed in projects that involve the Internet of Things philosophy.",

abstract="The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can be described as connecting everyday devices and wearables to the Internet in order to intelligently link them together, thus enabling new forms of communication between things (medical devices) and people (patients) and between things themselves. This paper describes a context-aware access control model that hinges on the role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and the capability-based access control (CapBAC) models. A prototype access control mechanism based on the model is intended to be incorporated into a personal health record (PHR) platform.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is a priority topic for research and innovation in ICT as well as a major trend for its development in the next period. Due to the large variety of IoT based solutions and their economic and social impact, the healthcare is among most relevant application domains to illustrate this trend. The paper presents the main adopted design and development decisions to build a platform for prototyping IoT based assistive applications with health monitoring capabilities. The prototyping approach is expected to improve the quality and speed up the deployment of these interdisciplinary solutions. A special emphasis was put on the platform architecture which is based on an IoT reference model and a reference architecture to take advantage of, and be compliant with relevant solutions in this field. The functional and information views of the platform architecture are detailed and the main development solutions are outlined.",
