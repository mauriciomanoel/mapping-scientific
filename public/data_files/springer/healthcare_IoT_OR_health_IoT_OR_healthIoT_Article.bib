abstract="There is increased interest in deploying big data technology in the healthcare industry to manage massive collections of heterogeneous health datasets such as electronic health records and sensor data, which are increasing in volume and variety due to the commoditization of digital devices such as mobile phones and wireless sensors. The modern healthcare system requires an overhaul of traditional healthcare software/hardware paradigms, which are ill-equipped to cope with the volume and diversity of the modern health data and must be augmented with new ``big data'' computing and analysis capabilities. For researchers, there is an opportunity in healthcare data analytics to study this vast amount of data, find patterns and trends within data and provide a solution for improving healthcare, thereby reducing costs, democratizing health access, and saving valuable human lives. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of different big data analytics integrated healthcare systems and describe the various applicable healthcare data analytics algorithms, techniques, and tools that may be deployed in wireless, cloud, Internet of Things settings. Finally, the contribution is given in formation of a convergence point of all these platforms in form of SmartHealth that could result in contributing to unified standard learning healthcare system for future.",

abstract="With the development of IoT (Internet of Thing), big data analysis and cloud computing, traditional medical information system integrates with these new technologies. The establishment of cloud-based smart healthcare application gets more and more attention. In this paper, semi-physical simulation technology is applied to cloud-based smart healthcare system. The Body sensor network (BSN) of system transmit has two ways of data collection and transmission. The one is using practical BSN to collect data and transmitting it to the data center. The other is transmitting real medical data to practical data center by simulating BSN. In order to transmit real medical data to practical data center by simulating BSN under semi-physical simulation environment, this paper designs an OPNET packet structure, defines a gateway node model between simulating BSN and practical data center and builds a custom protocol stack. Moreover, this paper conducts a large amount of simulation on the real data transmission through simulation network connecting with practical network. The simulation result can provides a reference for parameter settings of fully practical network and reduces the cost of devices and personnel involved.",

abstract="Among the extensive and impressive collection of applications enabled by IoT, smart and interactive healthcare is a particularly important one. To gather rich information indicator of our mental and physical health, IoT based sensors are either worn on the body or embedded in the living environment. Moreover, by incorporating the mobile computing technology in IoT based healthcare systems, the reactive care system can be transformed to proactive and preventive healthcare systems. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT based smart student m-healthcare monitoring framework is proposed. This framework computes the student diseases severity by predicting the potential disease with its level by temporally mining the health measurements collected from medical and other IoT devices. To effectively analyze the student healthcare data, an architectural model for smart student health care system has been designed. In our case study, health dataset of 182 suspected students are simulated to generate relevant waterborne diseses cases. This data is further analyzed to validate our model by using k-cross validation approach. Pattern based diagnosis scheme is applied using various classification algorithms and then results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and response time. Experimental results show that Decision tree (C4.5) and k-neighest neighbour algorithms perform better as compared to other classifiers in terms of above mentioned parameters. Moreover, the proposed methodology is effective in decision making by delivering time sensitive information to caretaker or doctor within specific time. Lastly, the temporal granule pattern based presentation reterives effective diagnosis results for the proposed system.",

abstract="Diabetes, blood pressure, heart, and kidney, some of the diseases common across the world, are termed 'silent killers'. More than 50 {\%} of the world's population are affected by these diseases. If suitable steps are not taken during the early stages then severe complications occur from these diseases. In the work proposed, we have discussed the manner in which the Internet-of-Things based Cloud centric architecture is used for predictive analysis of physical activities of the users in sustainable health centers. The architecture proposed is based on the embedded sensors of the equipment rather than using wearable sensors or Smartphone sensors to store the value of the basic health-related parameters. Cloud centric architecture is composed of a Cloud data center, Public cloud, Private cloud, and uses the XML Web services for secure and fast communication of information. The architecture proposed here is evaluated for its adoption, prediction analysis of physical activities, efficiency, and security. From the results obtained it can be seen that the overall response between the local database server and Cloud data center remains almost constant with the rise in the number of users. For prediction analysis, If the results collected in real time for the analysis of physical activities exceed any of the parameter limits of the defined threshold value then an alert is sent to the health care personnel. Security analysis also shows the effective encryption and decryption of information. The architecture presented is effective and reduces the proliferation of information. It is also suggested, that a person suffering from any of the diseases mentioned above can defer the onset of complications by doing regular physical activities.",

abstract="The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has made medical equipment smaller and smarter, while computing environment has shifted from server-client wire/wireless communication networks toward diverse portable laptops, smartphones, tablet PCs, and PDAs. The communication between smaller IoT devices has added to the accuracy and convenience of distance healthcare services. However, security issues in communication sessions resulting from the leakage of personal medical information, infringements of privacy and improper management of medical information are looming large. Since personal medical information is transmitted between wire/wireless devices, the threats to secure distance medical service could be detrimental to further advancement of IoT in healthcare. Hence, this paper proposed a method of addressing the vulnerabilities to a range of attacks in the communication between medical devices. The proposed IoT-based communication protocol used random numbers and session keys to transmit hashed and encrypted data, and underwent a formal verification, where the transmitted data remained intact against data extraction and other attacks.",

Frailty of old age, susceptibility to diseases, and impairments are inevitable issues that these senior adults need to deal with in daily life. Recently, there has been an increasing demand on developing elderly care services utilizing novel technologies, with the aim of providing independent living. Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring. We investigate the existing approaches by considering the elderly requirements at the center of the attention. In addition, we evaluate the main objectives and trends in IoT-based elderly monitoring systems in order to pave the way for future systems to improve the quality of elderly's life.",

With computation at user-end, it provides a fog-based computing paradigm to generate time senstive results, which along with cloud storage presents a comprehensive Fog-Cloud computing paradigm. Because of these reasons, the work presented in this paper focuses on utilizing the potential of IoT Technology to provide a novel Fog-Cloud architecture for efficient healthcare services in smart office. Specifically, a Fog-Cloud architecture has been proposed to monitor and analyze various health attributes of a person during his working hours. Moreover, the framework indulges various activities in the ambient office environment with the purpose of analyzing it for health severity. In order to realize this, a probabilistic measure, named as Severity Index (SI) is defined to evaluate the adverse effects of different activities on personal health. Finally, an application scenario of temporal healthcare predictive monitoring and alert generation is discussed to depict the ideology of Smart Office Healthcare. In order to validate the system, an experimental implmentation is performed on heterogenous datasets. The results obtained in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed model is highly efficient and accurate for providing appropriate healthcare environment during working hours of a person in a smart office.",

With the aid of machine learning algorithms and cloud computing services, the stress prediction algorithm produces adaptive and personalized prediction models based on the user's context gathered from their smartphone. The prediction models are able to adapt the changing nature of both the user's stress status and the surrounding environment.

abstract="Healthy people are important for any nation's development. Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called ``Big Data.'' Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called ``Intelligent Building,'' depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system has the capability of efficiently processing WBAN sensory data from millions of users in order to perform real-time responses in case of emergencies.",

abstract="In this research, we propose virtual caregiver (VCareGiver), a virtual caregiver as a cyber-physical smart home (CPSH) companion to support the daily life activities of elderly people through their gestures. The CPSH will act as a virtual caregiver who will understand the need of an elderly person and be present with him/her ubiquitously at any time and at any location within his/her house. VCareGiver will help in solving two important problems. Firstly, a large population is at their old age who needs help in their daily chores, since the family members are unable to give full support (e.g. reminding the to-do list, maintaining appointments, taking medicine on right time, sending SMS, saving energy due to consumption of electricity, controlling home appliances, etc.) due to busy schedule. Secondly, due to the old age movement problem, they need support in doing activities through gesture. In this research, we want to test the viability of the virtual caregiver as a physical assistant. The gestures of an elderly subject in the physical world are recognized by a multi-sensory IoT-based framework that is passed to the CPSH, which analyses the gestures and generates a command to perform certain physical world activity and finally produce the visualization. A proof of concept CPSH has been implemented through the web, and smartphone based applications. More than 100 different gestures have been incorporated into the CPSH system through which different daily life activities can be performed. Initial test results are very encouraging and show the prospect of such virtual caregiver, which can revolutionize the quality of life of our prospective elderly generation.",
