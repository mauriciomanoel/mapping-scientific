abstract="As health data are very sensitive, there is a need to prevent and control the health data with end-to-end security solutions. In general, a number of authentication and authorization schemes are available to prevent and protect the sensitive data, which are collected with the help of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The transport layer security (TLS) protocol is designed to transfer the data from source to destination in more reliable manner. This protocol enables a user to overcome the no lost or reordered messages. The more challenge with TLS is to tolerate unreliability. In order to overcome this issue, Datagram transport layer security (DTLS) protocol has been designed and used in low-power wireless constrained networks. The DTLS protocol consists of a base protocol, record layer, handshake protocol, ChangeCipherSpec and alert protocol. The complex issue with the DTLS protocol is the possibility of an attacker could send a number of ClientHello messages to a server. This scenario would cause a denial-of-service (DOS) attack against the server. This DoS attack enables new connection between the attacker and server, increasing attacker bandwidth, and allocation of resources for every ClientHello message. In order to overcome this issue, we have proposed a smart gateway-based authentication and authorization method to prevent and protect more sensitive physiological data from an attacker and malicious users. The enhanced smart gateway-based DTLS is demonstrated with the help of Contiki Network Simulator. The packet loss ratio is calculated for the CoAP, host identity protocol, CoAP-DTLS and CoAP-enhanced DTLS to evaluate the performance of the proposed work. Data transmission and handshake time are also calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the enhanced DTLS.",

In this paper, a heterogeneous secure scheme is proposed to build a secure channel between WSNs and Internet server in the IoTs. To achieve better security with minimum cost in WSNs, certificateless and online/offline technique are used. In addition, to increase the scalability at the Internet server side, public key infrastructure is used. As compared with four existing heterogeneous schemes, the proposed scheme has less energy consumption and computational cost.

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is one of several technology trends, and IoT applications are found in a wide range of industry sectors such as healthcare and critical infrastructure. Authenticated key exchange schemes play an important role in protecting user and data privacy and ensuring the security of data-in-transit in IoT infrastructure (e.g. via user identification and provision of secure communication). However, designing secure authenticated key exchange (AKE) schemes remain a challenging task. In this paper, we reveal that Challa et al.'s three-factor AKE scheme is vulnerable to a number of known attacks. Then, we present an improved signature-based three-factor authenticated key exchange protocol and prove its security under the extended model of Bellare et al. (Tecnologia Electronica E Informatica 1807:139--155, 2000). A comparative summary is also presented, which demonstrates that our proposed scheme is sufficiently lightweight for IoT deployment and outperforms those of Challa et al.

abstract="Recently, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has drawn considerable attention from both industry and academia. In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie--Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT.",

pages="72--85",
abstract="In this article, we present a unified perspective on the cognitive internet of things (CIoT). It is noted that within the CIoT design we observe the convergence of energy harvesting, cognitive spectrum access and mobile cloud computing technologies. We unify these distinct technologies into a CIoT architecture which provides a flexible, dynamic, scalable and robust network design road-map for large scale IoT deployment. Since the prime objective of the CIoT network is to ensure connectivity between things, we identify key metrics which characterize the network design space. We revisit the definition of cognition in the context of IoT networks and argue that both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency are key design constraints. To this end, we define a new performance metric called the `overall link success probability' which encapsulates these constraints. The overall link success probability is characterized by both the self-sustainablitiy of the link through energy harvesting and the availability of spectrum for transmissions. With the help of a reference scenario, we demonstrate that well-known tools from stochastic geometry can be employed to investigate both the node and the network level performance. In particular, the reference scenario considers a large scale deployment of a CIoT network empowered by solar energy harvesting deployed along with the centralized CIoT device coordinators. It is assumed that CIoT network is underlaid with a cellular network, i.e., CIoT nodes share spectrum with mobile users subject to a certain co-existence constraint. Considering the dynamics of both energy harvesting and spectrum sharing, the overall link success probability is then quantified. It is shown that both the self-sustainability of the link, and the availability of transmission opportunites, are coupled through a common parameter, i.e., the node level transmit power. Furthermore, provided the co-existence constraint is satisfied, the link level success in the presence of both the inter-network and intra-network interference is an increasing function of the transmit power. We demonstrate that the overall link level success probability can be maximized by employing a certain optimal transmit power. Characterization of such an optimal operational point is presented. Finally, we highlight some of the future directions which can benefit from the analytical framework developed in this paper.",

Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring.

However, this future paradigm will only be possible if the right decisions can be made based on the analysis of huge volumes of collected data: i.e. if the dependability of C-IoT is ensured. To address this challenge, we studied a simplified view of a C-IoT architecture composed of devices using three different technologies that have enabled the existence of IoT (RFID, NFC and Beacons). However, our proposal could be extended to any other devices in the context of C-IoT.

IoT is an emerging concept, based on the convergence of legacy technologies, like RFID, WSN and smart objects, for connecting billions of ``things''. Such a massive connectivity generates a huge data for analysis, processing, mining and storage. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of IoT is also raising significant technical and application challenges. Many countries are innovating and adapting IoT for the development of the country's economy. Korea, being a digitally advanced country, is already ranked second in ``suitability of preparedness for IoT opportunities''. In this paper, we first mention the vision, capabilities and status of IoT. Next, we discuss the architectural requirements and popular global IoT projects. Subsequently, we review the history, research plans and applications of Korean IoT. Finally, our work concludes with a list of major open issues and challenges faced by the Korean IoT industry with pointers to possible solutions.",

abstract="In several earlier papers, the author defined and detailed the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with other servgoods---thus, constituting an Internet of Things (IoT) or servgoods. More importantly, real-time decision making is central to the Internet of Things; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Indeed, real-time decision making (RTDM) is becoming an integral aspect of IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), including its improving abilities at voice and video recognition, speech and predictive synthesis, and language and social-media understanding. These three key and mutually supportive technologies---IoT, RTDM, and AI---are considered herein, including their progress to date.",

abstract="With the recent development of Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) and the potential of Cyber Physical System (CPS), people's daily activities become smarter, and intelligent. The combination of CIoT and CPS can greatly enhance the quality of people's life. To this end, this article proposes CIoT-CPS that comprises of two main models: user activity cognitive model and image authentication model.The user activity cognitive model (UACM) is a machine-learning model to have the meaningful data. The image authentication model is to verify the authenticity of images captured by various devices, such as smart phones, digital cameras, and other camera-embedded portable devices. The authenticity of an image is breached when parts of images are assembled to produce a new image (known as a splicing forgery), or a part of an image is copied or pasted into another part of the same image (known as a copy-move forgery). In the proposed verification method, an opposite color local binary pattern (OC-LBP) texture descriptor is applied to a questioned image. The image is first decomposed into an RGB (red, green, blue) and a luminance and chroma color spaces. The OC-LBP measures the interrelation between pixels of different color components. The intensive computation involving six color components and a gray version is performed in the cloud, where a server can be dedicated to doing this job. The histograms of the OC-LBP are concatenated with weights to produce a final feature vector of the image. A support vector machine is applied as a classifier, which classifies the image as authentic or forged. Several experiments were performed to verify the suitability of those models or approaches. The proposed approaches show a good accuracy compared to other competing approaches.",

abstract="Wireless network devices are used for the Internet of Things in a variety of applications, and although the IoT has many benefits, there are some security issues in this area. Hacking tools that are widely used in wireless communication enable the attacker to export the information stored in the device memory. Devices within the IoT should not allow this information to be accessed without an authentication. In this paper, we propose an efficient device authentication protocol without certification authority for the Internet of Things. Compared to the existing Constrained Application Protocol, the proposed protocol increases efficiency by minimizing the number of message exchanges. Since our protocol is based on a keyed hash algorithm, the Certificate of Authority is not required. Experimental results show that the proposed authentication protocol improves the security level and reduces the resource consumption of devices.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a comprehensive environment that consists of a large number of sensors and mediators interconnecting heterogeneous physical objects to the Internet. IoT applications are prominent in many areas such as smart city, smart workplace, smart plants, smart agriculture and various ubiquitous computing areas. The research roadmap of IoT spans across vast domains such as mobile computing, wireless and sensor networks, service oriented computing, middleware, cloud computing and big data analytics, taking advantage of several recent breakthroughs in the respective domains. Primarily, the challenges associated with realization of IoT scenarios can be summarized across three layers: sensing and smart devices layer, connectivity layer and cloud layer. The first layer deals with the physical objects, including energy-efficient communication of the devices and developing the associated standards so that the interaction among the devices is seamless. The connectivity layer deals with the sensor data acquisition and provisioning, through gateways and sinks. The top cloud layer deals with resource provisioning for storage and processing of the acquired data, in extracting domain specific information. The participation of smart phones both as sensors and the gateways, brings in the scope for mobile web services and mobile cloud services, into this cloud based IoT architecture. The paper takes the cross-layered approach and tries to address the primary challenges of IoT through mobile web and cloud services.

The VCCA selects the cluster head (CH) that has the highest network capacity through a classification process of cluster variables in accordance with the characteristics in order to configure a clustered network, which differs for different IoT applications. To achieve this, the VCCA employs a fuzzy inference system (FIS) that calculates an outcome through rule-based variable mapping for low complexity in the CH election and high scalability of cluster variables. In addition, experimental simulations using MATLAB are conducted to evaluate the performance of the VCCA. The simulation results show that the VCCA exhibits better network performance compared to the existing algorithms in terms of throughput, end-to-end latency, network lifetime, and energy consumption.",

The major problems facing by blind people fall in the category of navigating through indoor and outdoor environments consisting of various obstacles and recognition of person in front of them. Identification of objects or person only with perceptive and audio information is difficult. An intelligent, portable, less expensive, self-contained navigation and face recognition system is highly demanded for blind people. This helps blind people to navigate with the help of a Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) and a system equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Face recognition can be done using neural learning techniques with feature extraction and training modules. The images of friends, relatives are stored in the database of user Smartphone. Whenever a person comes in front of the blind user, the application with the help of neural network gives the voice aid to the user. Thus this system can replace the regular imprecise use of guide dogs as well as white sticks to help the navigation and face recognition process for people with impaired vision.In this paper, we have proposed a novel image recognition and navigation system which provides precise and quick messages in the form of audio to visually challenged people so that they can navigate easily.

Traditional batteries in IoT produce environmental concerns and have limited operational life. Harvesting and converting ambient environmental energy is an effective and important approach for sustainable green power used in wireless and portable devices in IoT. This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art development of different energy harvesting sources including mechanical, light/solar, wind, sound, RF, biomechanical and pyroelectric energy. Power density generated from ambient source ranges widely from 0.001 $\mu$W/cm2 (RF WiFi) to 100 mW/cm2 (outdoor solar). Depends on application areas and working principles, typical power consumptions of IoT sensor nodes are in the order of mW (1--750 mW) in active mode and $\mu$W (0--60 $\mu$W) in sleep mode (Mathna et al. in Talanta 75:613--623, 2008; Magno et al. in IEEE Trans Ind Electron 61:1871--1881, 2014; Baranov et al. in Sens Actuators A 233:279--289, 2015; Somov et al. in Procedia Eng 87:520--523, 2014; Spirjakin et al. in Sens Actuators A 247:247--253, 2016; Samson et al. in Sens Actuators A 172:240--244, 2011). Therefore, efficient energy storage and management strategies are important for IoT development. These parts are discussed in order to provide the sustainable power. MEMS based energy harvesting devices may be widely employed in various areas, such as military monitoring, remote weather station, bluetooth headsets, and environment detection.

The Internet of Things (IOT) integrates many technologies, such as Internet, Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, WiFi, GPRS, 3G, etc., which can enable different ways to obtain the location information of various objects. Location-based service is a primary service of the IOT, while localization accuracy is a key issue. In this paper, a higher accuracy localization scheme is proposed which can effectively satisfy diverse requirements for many indoor and outdoor location services. The proposed scheme composes of two phases: (1) the partition phase, in which the target region is split into small grids; (2) the localization refinement phase, in which a higher accuracy of localization can be obtained by applying an algorithm designed in the paper. A trial system is set up to verify correctness of the proposed scheme and furthermore to illustrate its feasibility and availability. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the localization accuracy.",

Nowadays, many third party service providers are providing a large number of IoT services. Suggesting suitable services to IoT users based on objects they own has not been tackled yet. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of leveraging recommendation algorithms, especially graph-based, to IoT. We propose a graph-based model for IoT systems and conduct experiment in which analyze and explore correlations between performances of different algorithms. We show that the graph-based recommendation algorithm can be used to develop an effective recommender system for the IoT.

abstract="Developments in Internet of Things (IoT) Technology have been effectively utilized in different industrial sectors for monitoring, surveillance, and remote decision-making. The ability to acquire in-depth information about ubiquitous events has proliferated numerous opportunities for using this technology in sensitive domains like national defence security. In this paper, a comprehensive IoT-based framework is presented for analyzing national integrity of defence personnel with consideration to his/her daily activities. As reported by investigating agencies of many countries, routinely engagements of defence personnel are one of the premier reasons for vulnerability to national defence through intentional and unintentional information outflow of defence secrets. The work presented in this research is focused on monitoring various activities of defence personnel to determine his/her integral behavior in daily life. Specifically, Integrity Index Value is defined for every defence personnel based on different social engagements, and activities for detecting the vulnerability to national security. In addition to this, a probabilistic decision tree based automated decision making is presented to aid defence officials in analyzing various activities of a defence personnel for his/her integrity assessment. In order to validate the proposed framework, three challenging data sets have been considered for experimental evaluation. The computed results are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques for overall assessment. Results show that the proposed model achieves better performance in monitoring and analyzing activities of defence personnel for effective decision making.",

abstract="Progression of the internet technologies has led to the emergence of internet of things (IoT). One of the familiar deployment of IoT is through radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. In recent times, RFID based systems are one of the most widely spread applications for tagging and keep tracking purposes in IoT deployment. This is due to their powerful features compared to their counterparts of similar techniques such as barcodes. In contrast, radio-frequency identification systems suffer from various attacks and security threats. The wireless channel used for communication is responsible for the majority of these vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a new radio-frequency identification authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to eliminate these vulnerabilities. In addition, we use elliptic curve Diffie--Hellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol to generate a temporary shared key used to encrypt the later transmitted messages. Our protocol achieves a set of security properties likes mutual authentication, anonymity, confidentiality, forward security, location privacy, resistance of man-in-the-middle attack, resistance of replay attack and resistance of impersonation attack. We implement our proposed protocol in real RFID system using Omnikey smartcard reader (Omnikey 5421) and NXP Java smartcards (J3A040). Implementation results shows that our proposed protocol outperform in term of time complexity as compared to other similar protocols and requires less number of operations.",

This is because IoT devices support health tracking, security monitoring, consumer tracking, forecasting, and so on. However, the huge interconnectedness in IoT architectures complicates traceability and faulty data propagation is not easily detected since there are challenges with data origin authentication. Thus, this research proposes a provenance technique to deal with these issues. The technique is based on associative rules and lexical chaining methodologies, which enable traceability through the identification of propagation routes of data and object-to-object communications. Through visualization tools, the proposed methodologies also enabled us to determine linkability and unlinkability between IoT devices in a network which further leads to mechanisms to check correctness in sensor data propagation.",

IoT unlocks many exciting new opportunities in a variety of applications in research and industry domains. However, many have complained about the absence of the real-world IoT data. Unsurprisingly, a common question that arises regularly nowadays is ``Does the IoT already exist?''. So far, little has been known about the real-world situation on IoT, its attributes, the presentation of data, and user interests. To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More specifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler engine to collect large-scale real-world IoT data for the first time. We make the results of our work available to the public in order to assist the community in the future research. In particular, we collect the data of nearly two million Internet connected objects and study trends in IoT using a real-world query set from an IoT search engine. Based on the collected data and our analysis, we identify the typical characteristics of IoT data. The most intriguing finding of our study is that IoT data is mainly disseminated using Web Mapping while the emerging IoT solutions such as the Web of Things are currently not well adopted. On top of our findings, we further discuss future challenges and open research problems in the IoT area.",

In this paper, an integrated three-stage model is presented based on IoT technology for the optimization of procurement, production and product recovery, pricing and strategy of return acquisition. The remaining value is used to measure the return condition. The model considers three recovery options related to refurbishing, component reuse and disposal, and the value deterioration for satisfying the product demand in each stage of product life cycle (PLC). A novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on two heuristic methods is proposed to solve the problem.

IoT technologies and Internet Protocol connectivity enable wide ranges of network devices to communicate irrespective of their resource capabilities and local networks. In order to provide seamless connectivity and interoperability, it is notable to maintain secure end-to-end (E2E) communication links in IoT. However, device constraints and the dynamic link creations make it challenging to use pre-shared keys for every secure E2E communication scenario in IoT. Variants of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) are adopted for constructing dynamic and secure E2E connections among the heterogeneous network devices with imbalanced resource profiles and less or no previous knowledge about each other. We propose a solution called collaborative HIP (CHIP) with an efficient key establishment component for the high resource-constrained devices in IoT. CHIP delegates the expensive cryptographic operations to the resource rich devices in the local networks. Finally, by providing quantitative performance evaluation and descriptive security analysis, we demonstrate the applicability of the key establishment in CHIP for the constrained IoT devices rather than the existing HIP variants.",

A middleware can ease application development by providing the necessary functional components for service registration, discovery and composition. Recently, there have been a large number of proposals for IoT middleware solutions, and a few recent studies have surveyed and qualitatively evaluated these IoT middleware proposals against a variety of functional features. This paper is an extension of these studies with an evaluation of four representative middlewares in a small-scale scenario to provide a more in-depth perspective of the state of the art with reference to the scale and heterogeneity of dynamic IoT environments. The results show a number of issues. Service registration, discovery and composition components still require human intervention. With such a large number of available services, these components need to be automated to enable fast deployment and adaptation of IoT applications. The scalability evaluation of new proposals should follow a holistic approach, as opposed to considering only individual components. Finally, support for user's non-functional requirements is limited to best-effort QoS.",

abstract="The pervasive use of smart objects is encouraging the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where even the most common and simple object is expected to acquire information from the surrounding ambient and to cooperate with other objects to achieve a common goal . In such a heterogeneous and complex scenario, optimal allocation of resources to application tasks (e.g., available energy, computing speed, storage capacity) is paramount to fairly distribute them and not overload some objects. In this paper, we focus on finding the optimal assignment to the physical devices that can perform the same task needed by the running applications. To this, we rely on the technologies that have been already developed around the notion of Virtual Object (VO), which is the digital counterpart of the physical object and is used to augment its functionalities with the use of virtualization technologies. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we extend the current functionalities of VOs to make them capable of implementing a distributed strategy for the allocation of tasks among objects: the information model is enhanced to include the Quality of Information (QoI) notion and the possible different architectural solutions are presented. Secondly, we propose a distributed algorithm where VOs negotiate to reach a consensus on resources allocation, in order to distribute the workload among the objects that can cooperate to the same task and to ensure that the QoI requirements are fulfilled. Simulation results show that, compared to a static frequency allocation, the algorithm enhances the performance of the system with an average improvement of 27{\%} in network lifetime and confirms the compliance to QoI requirements.",

The innovative design for the IoT paradigm has mainly based on ``Virtualization technology'' to provide the full interaction for the user within the system environment. Meanwhile, it alleviates potential system complications. In this end, this paper seeks to introduce a new vision of an IoT virtualization framework based on Sensor-as-a-Service (SenaaS) to maximize the utilization of sensor functionalities. Moreover, the paper offers an adaptor oriented structure technique by using ITA Sensor Fabric (aka Information Fabric) which relies on Publish/Subscribe mechanism to realize an oriented communication between things. In our proposed framework, ITA Sensor Fabric used as a parallel measure with the semantic approach for mitigating the principle issues in the sensor arena. Furthermore, the proposed framework uses Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSA) to enhance the SenaaS performance with the time-sensitive services and ensure the required level of the Quality of Service (QoS). The effectiveness of the proposed framework tested by using MATLAB and NS2-based simulations in terms of delay time, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and jitter. Finally, all the experimental results proved that BSA has a significant influence on the time-sensitive services more than their analogues of algorithms.",

In this paper, we propose a new location privacy technique called the enhanced semantic obfuscation technique (ESOT) to preserve the location information of a user. Experimental results show that ESOT achieves improved location privacy and service utility when compared with a well-known existing approach, the semantic obfuscation technique.",

abstract="This paper proposes a recommendation system based on big data framework and rule-based system in the era of Internet of Things. With the emergence of the smart devices beginning from smart phones extends to the general electronic devices such as smart tv sets, refrigerators, washing machines, robot vacuums, and so on. Such smart devices make it possible to collect the device-usage logs of end users whereby a system is able to analyze it to find the usage patterns of the end users and make recommendations to the end users. Furthermore, this allows to make recommendations on the individual users since the smart devices have their own identifiers such as MAC address and IPv6 address. The smart devices also have matched information with the end user id/s. In this study, we propose a method for analyzing the devise-usage patterns in semi-real time based on the big-data system architecture. We also present a recommendation framework which makes device-usage recommendations by using a rule-based system architecture with the analyzed usage patterns. Lastly, we introduce a segmentation-based analysis and recommendation framework to make recommendations based not only on his or her own usage patterns, but also on the common usage patterns of the users who are living in a similar context. The segmentation is formed also based on the types of the device usages, so that the analysis can be performed in a batch process thereby enabling to make the recommendations in real time based on the pre-analyzed usage patterns.",

The new technology provides more facilities and enhancements to the existing healthcare services as it allows more flexibility in terms of monitoring patients records and remotely connecting with the patients via cloud of things. However, there are many security issues such as privacy and security of healthcare data which need to be considered once we introduce wearable devices to the healthcare service. Although some of the security issues were addressed by some researchers in the literature, they mainly addressed cloud of things security or healthcare security separately and their work still suffers from limited security protection and vulnerabilities to some security attacks. The proposed new healthcare system combines security of both healthcare and cloud of things technologies. It also addresses most of the security challenges that might face the healthcare services such as the man in the middle (MITM), eavesdropping, replay, repudiation, and modification attacks. Scyther verification tool was also used to verify the robustness and correctness of the proposed system.",

The proposed IoT healthcare monitoring system consists of number of mobile doctors, patient and mobile ambulance. Performance rank (PR) index is calculated for each mobile ambulance based on the medical capacity (b) of the mobile ambulance, the number of patients currently using the mobile ambulance (n), and the Euclidean distance from a neighboring mobile ambulance. The minimum PR index is considered as best ambulance to provide a service to the patient. Random waypoint mobility model is used to simulate the proposed IoT based healthcare monitoring system. The proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm is compared with various node selection algorithms such as cluster based routing protocol, workload-aware channel assignment algorithm and scenario-based clustering algorithm for performance evaluation. The packet delivery fraction, normalized routing load and average end-to-end delay are calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm.

The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) is underpinned by the integration or mass customization of services and/or goods. The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as goods and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced as ``ServGoods'', resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage to the industrialized countries where the consuming customers are at the same time the co-producing producers. Adding sensors to these ServGoods and letting them connect or communicate among themselves or with other ServGoods can result in an Internet of Things (i.e., connected ServGoods).

The decentralized approach can be enabled using manufacturing objects that are capable of negotiating with their environment, observing it, making decisions according to these observations, and sharing information on their status and needs. For these purposes, automatic identification (auto-ID) technology is required. Automatic identification involves techniques for automatically identifying things by using tokens with individual codes, collecting information on them, and transferring that information automatically into computer systems. In general, not only techniques such as barcode, optical character recognition (OCR), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) are associated with auto-ID but also other techniques that are less used in manufacturing can be highlighted. The present study seeks to map the existing techniques for automatic identification of objects and to determine their most potential targets of use in manufacturing.",

However, as the number of PHDs increase, the number of other peripherals connected in PAN also increases. Therefore, PHDs are now competing for medium access with other devices, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of health applications in the PAN. In this article we present a reference architecture to prioritize PHD connections based on their state and requirements, creating a healthcare Smart Gateway. Healthcare context information is extracted by observing the traffic through the gateway. A standard-based approach was used to identify health traffic based on ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards. A reference implementation was developed showing the relevance of the problem and how the proposed architecture can assist in the prioritization.

abstract="As IoT technologies have become more available, healthcare patients increasingly want to be provided with services at places other than hospitals or their homes. Most patients with implantable devices still visit hospitals, sometimes using a self-driving car or public transportation to obtain services. When an emergency situation develops for a patient in a vehicle lacking the means to address the crisis, the patient's life cannot help but be in danger. The present paper proposes an IoT healthcare service model that will enable patients with a medical sensor to be provided healthcare services in a vehicle installed with IoT devices. To solve problems in existing models that do not include electromagnetic interference-based (EMI) multiple property management and control, the proposed model involves medical sensors with different multiple-property information guarantee targeted SINRs and minimum blackouts. The model also features the ability to connect to hospital healthcare service centers using the IoT devices installed in vehicles, thereby enabling information on the patient's condition and first aid needs to be transmitted in real time. To secure the patient's biometric data during information transmission, the proposed model weights that information to enhance the efficiency of the IoT devices. Performance evaluation results revealed that compared to existing algorithms, the communication strength of the proposed model is an average of 5.2{\%} higher, and network efficiency between IoT devices and medical sensors is an average of 7.6{\%} higher. In addition, the overhead on IoT devices was an average of 3.5{\%} lower.",

journal="Cluster Computing",

abstract="The Internet of healthcare things is essentially a new model that changes the way of the delivery and management of healthcare services. It utilizes digital sensors and cloud computing to present a quality healthcare service outside of the classical hospital environment. This resulted in the emergence of a new class of online web 4.0 services, which are termed ``cloud healthcare services''. Cloud healthcare services offer a straightforward opportunity for patients to communicate with healthcare professionals and utilize their personal IoHT devices to obtain timely and accurate medical guidance and decisions. The personal IoHT devices integrate sensed health data at a central cloud healthcare service to extract useful health insights for wellness and preventive care strategies. However, the present practices for cloud healthcare services rely on a centralized approach, where patients' health data are collected and stored on servers, located at remote locations, which might be functioning under data privacy laws somewhat different from the ones applied where the service is running. Promoting a privacy respecting cloud services encourages patients to actively participate in these healthcare services and to routinely provide an accurate and precious health data about themselves. With the emergence of fog computing paradigm, privacy protection can now be enforced at the edge of the patient's network regardless of the location of service providers. In this paper, a framework for cloud healthcare recommender service is presented. We depicted the personal gateways at the patients' side act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between IoHT devices and cloud healthcare services. A fog-based middleware will be hosted on these fog nodes for an efficient aggregation of patients generated health data while maintaining the privacy and the confidentiality of their health profiles. The proposed middleware executes a two-stage concealment process that utilizes the hierarchical nature of IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. At that, the patients will be empowered with a tool to control the privacy of their health data by enabling them to release their health data in a concealed form. The further processing at the cloud healthcare service continues over the concealed data by applying the proposed protocols. The proposed solution was integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the patients' health data when utilized by a cloud healthcare recommender service to generate health insights. Our approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both patients and service providers.",

In the work proposed, we have discussed the manner in which the Internet-of-Things based Cloud centric architecture is used for predictive analysis of physical activities of the users in sustainable health centers. The architecture proposed is based on the embedded sensors of the equipment rather than using wearable sensors or Smartphone sensors to store the value of the basic health-related parameters. Cloud centric architecture is composed of a Cloud data center, Public cloud, Private cloud, and uses the XML Web services for secure and fast communication of information. The architecture proposed here is evaluated for its adoption, prediction analysis of physical activities, efficiency, and security. From the results obtained it can be seen that the overall response between the local database server and Cloud data center remains almost constant with the rise in the number of users. For prediction analysis, If the results collected in real time for the analysis of physical activities exceed any of the parameter limits of the defined threshold value then an alert is sent to the health care personnel. Security analysis also shows the effective encryption and decryption of information. The architecture presented is effective and reduces the proliferation of information. It is also suggested, that a person suffering from any of the diseases mentioned above can defer the onset of complications by doing regular physical activities.",

Because of these reasons, the work presented in this paper focuses on utilizing the potential of IoT Technology to provide a novel Fog-Cloud architecture for efficient healthcare services in smart office. Specifically, a Fog-Cloud architecture has been proposed to monitor and analyze various health attributes of a person during his working hours. Moreover, the framework indulges various activities in the ambient office environment with the purpose of analyzing it for health severity. In order to realize this, a probabilistic measure, named as Severity Index (SI) is defined to evaluate the adverse effects of different activities on personal health. Finally, an application scenario of temporal healthcare predictive monitoring and alert generation is discussed to depict the ideology of Smart Office Healthcare. In order to validate the system, an experimental implmentation is performed on heterogenous datasets.

The results show that QoS criteria for data rate and latency specified by ISO/IEEE 11073 standard are satisfied by using the proposed energy-aware system. It is also demonstrated that some case studies considered in hospital information systems can be easily realized by the proposed framework by forming a time-saving simulation environment.",

abstract="Nowadays, tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is seen in smart environments such as medical remote care applications which are crucial due to the general aging of the population. With the recent advancements in IoT-based healthcare technologies, activity recognition can be used as the key part of the intelligent healthcare systems to monitor elderly people to live independently at homes and promote a better care. Recently, the evidence theory and its derivates approaches began to take place in the fields of activity recognition in these smart systems. However, these approaches are generally inconsistent with the probability calculus due to the lower and upper probability bounds considering the combined evidences. To overcome these challenges and to get more precisely the reconcilement between the evidence theory with the frequentist approach of probability calculus, this work proposes a new methodology for combining beliefs, addressing some of the disadvantages exhibited by the evidence theory and its derivatives. This methodology merges the non-normalized conjunctive and the majority rules. The proposed rule is evaluated in numerical simulation case studies involving the activity recognition in a smart home environment. The results show that this strategy produces intuitive results in favor of the more committed hypothesis.",

abstract="The rapid introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology has boosted the service deliverance aspects of health sector in terms of m-health, and remote patient monitoring. IoT Technology is not only capable of sensing the acute details of sensitive events from wider perspectives, but it also provides a means to deliver services in time sensitive and efficient manner. Henceforth, IoT Technology has been efficiently adopted in different fields of the healthcare domain. In this paper, a framework for IoT based patient monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is presented to enhance the deliverance of curative services. Though ICUs remained a center of attraction for high quality care among researchers, still number of studies have depicted the vulnerability to a patient's life during ICU stay. The work presented in this study addresses such concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of various events (and anomalies) with temporal associations, followed by time sensitive alert generation procedure. In order to validate the system, it was deployed in 3 ICU room facilities for 30 days in which nearly 81 patients were monitored during their ICU stay. The results obtained after implementation depicts that IoT equipped ICUs are more efficient in monitoring sensitive events as compared to manual monitoring and traditional Tele-ICU monitoring. Moreover, the adopted methodology for alert generation with information presentation further enhances the utility of the system.",

Contactless technology for the WoT requires all parties to agree one common definition and implementation and, in this paper, we propose a new lightweight architecture for the WoT, based on RESTful approaches.

In this paper, we discuss how those technologies can be integrated together and fit into a seamless cycle like the one proposed in the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T). We also provide two case studies from our EiA project. The first case study is to demonstrate how a concept first tested in a virtual environment can be successfully implemented in the real world later when technological advances finally caught up. The data collection step and the ability to manually control smart objects of the W2T cycle are fulfilled in this step. The second case study is to show how the software simulator and hardware implementation are abstracted from the underlying algorithm, and thus, it serves as an example of how virtual worlds can be used as a test bed for W2T, especially with regards to the development of the remaining steps of the W2T cycle.",

This amalgamation of WBAN-based healthcare systems to cloud-based healthcare systems gave rise to serious privacy concerns to the sensitive healthcare data. Hence, there is a need for the proactive identification and effective mitigation mechanisms for these patient's data privacy concerns that pose continuous threats to the integrity and stability of the healthcare environment. For this purpose, a systematic literature review has been conducted that presents a clear picture of the privacy concerns of patient's data in cloud-assisted healthcare systems and analyzed the mechanisms that are recently proposed by the research community. The methodology used for conducting the review was based on Kitchenham guidelines. Results from the review show that most of the patient's data privacy techniques do not fully address the privacy concerns and therefore require more efforts. The summary presented in this paper would help in setting research directions for the techniques and mechanisms that are needed to address the patient's data privacy concerns in a balanced and light-weight manner by considering all the aspects and limitations of the cloud-assisted healthcare systems.",

This study converges smart manufacturing and additive manufacturing to form the long tail of making things as a paradigm shift for the new industrial revolution, which results in an ideal production system with the advantages of both economies of scale and scope. With the introduction of social aspects, socio-cyber-physical system (SCPS)-based manufacturing is proposed from the organizational semiotic perspective and exemplified by the four pillars of Future Internet. Furthermore, an extended version of the long tail is formed by the two modes of SCPS-based manufacturing: wisdom manufacturing and social manufacturing, which reviewed as the logical extension of smart manufacturing and additive manufacturing, respectively. Finally, a general interoperability model for SCPS-based manufacturing is suggested, which can also be applied to other integrated manufacturing systems.",

The need for increased response rate, problem limited storage, accelerated processing and etc. the tendency toward creating a new generation of healthcare system architecture highlight the need for further focus on cloud-based solutions for transfer data and data processing challenges. Integrity and reliability of healthcare systems are of critical importance, as even the slightest error may put the patients' lives in danger; therefore acquiring a behavioral model for these systems and developing the tools required to model their behaviors are of significant importance. The high-level designs may contain some flaws, therefor the system must be fully examined for different scenarios and conditions.

abstract="Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers, depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.",

abstract="Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

In order to overcome the hazards in the network, RFID authentication schemes for e-healthcare have been proposed by researchers. But since the computation ability of the tag is relatively weak, it is necessary to put forward a lightweight and secure scheme for medical systems. Moreover, cloud is widely accepted by people and used in many kinds of systems. So we propose a novel and lightweight RFID authentication scheme with cloud for e-healthcare applications. We use an enhanced formal security model to prove the security of our scheme. In this model the channel between the server and the reader is considered to be insecure and informal analysis is used to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Through the formal and informal analysis, our scheme not only resists the common attacks, but also keeps mutual authentication, information integrity, forward untraceability and backward untraceability. Moreover, both the tag and the reader can reach the anonymity. Our scheme is only hash-based and suitable to realize various security requirements.

abstract="As medical technology has been developing, patients' information (medical information, disease information, etc.) has been diversely used in medical services so that patients' biometric information can be used for remote diagnosis and examinations. However, since the complexity and uncertainty of patient treatment have been increasing, doctors' burden due to hospital work has been also increasing. In the present paper, an analytic hierarchy process based patient information management scheme is proposed that can synchronize diverse medical devices used for patient treatment to hierarchically manage patients' disease information. The purpose of the proposed scheme is to analyze the correlations of medical devices used in medical treatment of patients to induce hierarchical management of patients' disease information through triangle fuzzy of pairwise comparison scales for medical treatment and efficiently perform not only hospital administrative work but also patients' disease analysis and treatment. In addition, using the patients' disease information collected through diverse medical devices, the proposed scheme improves the efficiency of patient treatment methods so that hospitals can calculate the importance of treatment standards in order to hierarchically identify treatment standards. Furthermore, since the proposed scheme enables efficiently selecting treatment methods for patients' diseases, it has a characteristic of being capable of efficiently improve the ambiguousness and inaccuracy of treatment judgments and treatment compared to existing disease treatment methods. According to the results of performance evaluation, the proposed scheme improved work efficiency by 11.9{\%} over existing techniques and reduced medical device administration costs by 10.9{\%}. Furthermore, the proposed scheme improved patients' satisfaction with treatment by 23.6{\%}.",

In this context media (i.e., video) transmission is considered as a quite significant step during first hour of the emergency for presenting a big and better picture of the event. However, the energy hungry media transmission process and slow progress in battery technologies have become a major and serious problem for the evolution of video technology in medical internet of things (MIoT) or internet of medical things (IoMT). So, promoting Green (i.e., energy-efficient) transmission during voluminous and variable bit rate (VBR) video in MIoT is a challenging and crucial problem for researchers and engineers. Therefore, the need arose to conduct research on Green media transmission techniques to cater the need of upcoming wearable healthcare devices. Thus, this research contributes in two distinct ways; first, a novel and sustainable Green Media Transmission Algorithm (GMTA) is proposed, second, a mathematical model and architecture of Green MIoT are designed by considering a 8-min medical media stream named, `Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis' to minimize transmission energy consumption in media-aware MIoT, and to develop feasible media transmission schedule for sensitive and urgent health information from physian to patients and vice vers through extremely power hungry natured wearable devices.

abstract="Despite of various benefits such as a convenience and efficiency, home healthcare systems have some inherent security risks that may cause a serious leak on personal health information. This work presents a Secure User Profiling Structure which has the patient information including their health information. A patient and a hospital keep it at that same time, they share the updated data. While they share the data and communicate, the data can be leaked. To solve the security problems, a secure communication channel with a hash function and an One-Time Password between a client and a hospital should be established and to generate an input value to an OTP, it uses a dual hash-function. This work presents a dual hash function-based approach to generate the One-Time Password ensuring a secure communication channel with the secured key. In result, attackers are unable to decrypt the leaked information because of the secured key; in addition, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of computation cost.",

The innovation of smart things is envisioned through various protocols, but the most prevalent protocols are pub-sub protocols such as Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). An emerging paradigm of communication architecture for IoTs support is Fog computing in which events are processed near to the place they occur for efficient and fast response time. One of the major concerns in the adoption of Fog computing based publish-subscribe protocols for the Internet of things is the lack of security mechanisms because the existing security protocols such as SSL/TSL have a large overhead of computations, storage and communications. To address these issues, we propose a secure, Fog computing based publish-subscribe lightweight protocol using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for the Internet of Things. We present analytical proofs and results for resource efficient security, comparing to the existing protocols of traditional Internet.",

title="Influence of overhead on LTE downlink performance: a comprehensive model",
journal="Telecommunication Systems",
year="2017",
month="Jul",
day="07",
abstract="Overhead resource elements (REs) in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks are used for some control, signaling and synchronization tasks at both the Physical level and Media Access Control sub-level. Accurately computing all the overhead REs is necessary to achieve an efficient system design, which is difficult because LTE is a complex standard that contains a large number of implementation flexibilities and system configurations. The number of such REs depends on both the system configurations and services demanded. Aiming at exploring the influence of overhead on LTE downlink performance, we first parametrize each system configuration---including parameters corresponding to enhancement techniques such as Adaptive Modulation and Coding and Multi-Antenna Transmissions techniques---and those of the resource allocation mechanisms (which depend on users'  services). Second, using such parametrization, we model all overheads for synchronization, controlling and signaling operations in LTE Physical Downlink Shared/Control Channels. This allows for dynamically computing the useful REs (by subtracting the overhead REs from the total ones), both per Transmission Time Interval (TTI) and per frame (and hence, the corresponding bit rates). Our data rate-based performance model is able to accurately compute: (1) the real, exact system data rate or ``throughput'' (instead of approximations); and (2) the maximum number of simultaneous multi-service users per TTI that is able to support (called here ``capacity''). Aiming at understanding the impact of each overhead mechanism, we have carried out a variety of simulations, including different service provision scenarios, such as multi-user with multi-application. The simulation results prove our starting hypothesis that the influence of overhead on LTE performance should not be neglected. The parametrized and dynamic model quantifies to what extent throughput and capacity are modified by overhead---under a combination of system configurations and services, and may provide these performance metrics, throughput and capacity, as inputs to planning, dimensioning and optimization specialized tools.",

Induction of smart gadgetries, people lifestyle equipped with wearables, and development of IoT has revitalized the feature scale of these applications. The landscape of health applications encountering big data need to be replotted on cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources of handheld devices. With this transformation, the outcome from certain health applications is significant where precise, user-centric, and personalized recommendations mimic like a personal care-giver round the clock. To maximize the services spectrum from these applications over cloud, certain challenges like data privacy and communication cost need serious attention. Following the existing trend together with an ambition to promote and assist users with healthy lifestyle we propose a framework of Health Fog where Fog computing is used as an intermediary layer between the cloud and end users. The design feature of Health Fog successfully reduces the extra communication cost that is usually found high in similar systems. For enhanced and flexible control of data privacy and security, we also introduce the cloud access security broker (CASB) as an integral component of Health Fog where certain polices can be implemented accordingly. The modular framework design of Health Fog is capable of engaging data from multiple resources together with adequate level of security and privacy using existing cryptographic primitives.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks have recently been extensively researched due to the flexibility and cost savings they provide. One of the most promising applications of sensor networks is human health monitoring: wireless sensors are placed on the human body to form a wireless body network where the sensor node can continuously monitor real-time physiological parameters or human activities (motion detection). However, along with the flexibility, many problems arise due to a number of factors, including the bad quality of transmission media and the scarcity of resources. Moreover, sensor networks have different characteristics such as a variety of devices, different generated data, etc. From a quality of service (QoS) point of view, the healthcare domain can be seen as a real-time application demand to consider application requirements. Healthcare domains principally have stringent delay and loss requirements. Thus, considering different capabilities and ensuring time data delivery become necessary. Because wireless body area networks (WBAN) deal with human life, any delayed or lost data can endanger the user's life. This paper proposes a differentiated traffic and scheduling scheme for WBAN. It is based on patients' data classification and prioritization according to their current status and diseases. Through queue scheduling and path choice issues, the urgent data are delivered on time to provide a QoS guarantee for WBAN. Finally, it is shown that the proposed scheme is efficient for timely data transfer in WBAN.",

abstract="The Internet of Things' contribution lies in the increased value of information created by the number of interconnections among things and the subsequent transformation of processed information into knowledge for the benefit of society. The Internet of Things' sensors are deployed to monitor one or more events in an unattended environment. A large number of event data will be generated over a period of time in the Internet of Things. In the future, hundreds of billions of smart sensors and devices will interact with one another, without human intervention. Also, they will generate a large amount of data and resolutions, providing humans with information and the control of events and objects, even in remote physical environments. However, the demands of the Internet of Things cause heavy traffic or bottlenecks on particular nodes or on the paths of Internet of Things networks. Therefore, to resolve this issue, we propose an agent, Loadbot, that measures network loads and processes structural configurations by analyzing a large amount of user data and network loads. Additionally, in order to achieve efficient load balancing in the Internet of Things, we propose applying Deep Learning's Deep Belief Network method. Finally, using mathematical analysis, we address the key functions of our proposed scheme and simulate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.",

abstract="In recent years, wireless medical sensor networks meet the web to enable exciting healthcare applications that require data communication over the Internet. Often these applications suffer from data disclosure due to malicious users' activities. To prevent such data disclosure in the healthcare systems, many public key cryptographic techniques have been used. However, most of them are too expensive to implement in the web-enabled wireless medical sensor networks. In 2013, Xun et al. introduced a lightweight encryption algorithm to protect communication between the sensor node and the data servers. Their scheme is based on the Sharemind framework. However, Sharemind framework has a limitation on the number of data storage servers (ie., three servers only). In addition, Xun et al's scheme does not support privacy-preserving patient data analysis for distributed databases of different hospitals. In this paper, we introduce a new practical approach to prevent data disclosure from inside attack. Our new proposal is based on FairplayMP framework which enables programmers who are not experts in the theory of secure computation to implement such protocols. In addition, it support any number of n participants and is suitable for distributed environments. Moreover, in our new scheme, each sensor node needs only one secret key stored in advance to communicate with n different data servers, whereas three secret keys are embedded in advance into each sensor in order to communicate with three data servers in Xun et al's scheme.",

abstract="The design of large scale telecommunication networks is more than the technical allocation of capacity and path routing. By examining the design and allocation of resources in a broader sense, telecommunication network planning and management can better deliver value to the various stakeholders. This is significant especially when deploying networks in economically marginal areas such are rural, remote, or economically depressed regions. This paper presents a planning framework to systematically incorporate the influences, resources and decisions to effectively build or expand a network. Using a stake holders, input, process, output, customer approach, six key areas of society that derive value from better communication infrastructure in relatively unique manners were identified. These areas include healthcare, education, business, and others. The framework presented defines the inputs and outputs that accounts for the range of influences and outcomes in a network planning process. Inputs are broken down into four areas of concern (technical, market, financial, and application trends) that can influence how a network could be designed, along with four output areas (auxiliary activities, deployment strategies, technical design, and ownership and access). Through an extensive literature survey across many industries this framework was established to incorporate the many social economic and technical factors that influence telecommunication network planning and design.",

Now we are entering the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a paradigm in which real-world physical things can be connected to the Internet and provide services through the computing devices attached. The IoT infrastructure is starting to be integrated with ISs thereby diminishing the boundaries between the physical world and the business IT systems. With the development of IoT technologies, the number of connected things and their available physical services are increasing rapidly. Thus, selecting an appropriate service that satisfies a user's requirements from such services becomes a time-consuming challenge. To address this issue, we propose a Physical Service Model (PSM) as a common conceptual model to describe heterogeneous IoT physical services. PSM contains three core concepts (device, resource, and service) and specifies their relationships. Based on the proposed PSM, we define three types of Quality of Service (QoS) attributes and rate candidate services according to user requirements. To dynamically rate QoS values and select an appropriate physical service, we propose a Physical Service Selection (PSS) method that takes a user preference and an absolute dominance relationship among physical services into account. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

abstract="Today's medical industry can be represented by a human-centered u-healthcare paradigm that is available and accessible anywhere, where high-tech IT can serve as the basis at any time and any place. In addition, in the medical industry, studies of many of the developments and applications are actively conducted based on the development of information communication technology. The aim of medical-information systems is the construction of an advanced IT and integrated u-healthcare system that evolves in the direction of integrated medical-based IT-convergence systems. Accordingly, to resolve the problems of telemedicine, in terms of the remote access to medical data, some public and private initiatives have been proposed, ranging from patient-mobility approaches to medical data. In addition, regarding GENICloud, which provides links with the existing future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud, two out of the seven GENIAM APIs have been announced as the common APIs of the future Internet testbeds in GENI, and they have been implemented and are provided. In the present GENI Cloud system, due to the provision of limited APIs, restrictions may occur in the future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud system management. Therefore, this study proposes a cloud-based mobile health service for the enhancement of the quality of service (QoS) including factors such as reliability and response time to resolve the problems of the broadband-communication infrastructure in the existing mobile health service and the delay problem on the wireless body area network. In this paper, we propose the cloud-based u-healthcare network with a QoS-guaranteed mobile health service. For this method, the TMO-distribution object model that was used in the existing research to implement a reliable and efficient cloud system for users was not used, and instead, a cloud-platform environment was built up through the construction of a distributed system based on a cluster-based mobile object. For this purpose, this study considered the characteristics of the wireless-communication environments between the terminals and the cloud servers in the mobile cloud environment and the proposed cloud mobility services and the specialized mobile cloud-control software. Later, for linkages with cloud computing environments and testbeds was proposed. In addition, this study carried out a cloud mobility-control design to provide a service in the mobile cloud environment that is based on the actual future Internet testbeds. Lastly, based on the structured cloud-platform environment, this study designed access interfaces to provide a mobile healthcare service in consideration of the user convenience. For the mobile-service access interfaces, since the same service interfaces can be used to access the characteristics and functions of all of the applications from browsers and device clients, the model-view-controller structure of the platform was designed, including the components for the further improvement of the requirements, reuse, and maintenance of the codes in medium and large distributed systems.",

abstract="With the increasing demand for automated, remote, intelligent, and real-time healthcare services in smart cities, smart healthcare monitoring is necessary to provide improved and complete care to residents. In this monitoring, health-related media or signals collected from smart-devices/objects are transmitted and processed to cater to the need for quality care. However, it is challenging to create a framework or method to handle media-related healthcare data analytics or signals (e.g., voice/audio, video, or electroglottographic (EGG) signals) to meet the complex on-demand healthcare needs for successful smart city management. To this end, this paper proposes a cloud-oriented smart healthcare monitoring framework that interacts with surrounding smart devices, environments, and smart city stakeholders for affordable and accessible healthcare. As a smart city healthcare monitoring case study, a voice pathology detection (VPD) method is proposed. In the proposed method, two types of input, a voice signal and an EGG signal, are used. The input devices are connected to the Internet and the captured signals are transmitted to the cloud. The signals are then processed and classified as either normal or pathologic with a confidence score. These results are passed to registered doctors that make the final decision and take appropriate action. To process the signals, local features are extracted from the first-order derivative of the voice signal, and shape and cepstral features are extracted from the EGG signal. For classification, a Gaussian mixture model-based approach is used. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve VPD that is more than 93{\%} accurate.",

Several issues, such as accurate diagnosis, low-cost modeling, low-complexity design, seamless transmission, and sufficient storage, should be addressed while developing a complete healthcare framework. In this paper, we propose a patient state recognition system for the healthcare framework. We design the system in such a way that it provides good recognition accuracy, provides low-cost modeling, and is scalable. The system takes two main types of input, video and audio, which are captured in a multi-sensory environment. Speech and video input are processed separately during feature extraction and modeling; these two input modalities are merged at score level, where the scores are obtained from the models of different patients' states. For the experiments, 100 people were recruited to mimic a patient's states of normal, pain, and tensed. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an average 98.2 {\%} recognition accuracy.",

Aims to sustainable development is already considered as a major task for sustainable healthcare institutions, hence, identifying the indicators used in evaluation of the improvements towards sustainable healthcare is crucial in ensuring a better quality of life and well-being for Taiwan people. This research data were collected using the causal relationships among nineteen criteria and examined by decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. The method with an expert's interview provides a clear and transparent approach to analyze the cause and effect findings within criteria. Findings show that the critical factor; corporate governance is a very important part of the business strategy and factor of clinical performance is in particular one of the key criteria for sustainable healthcare institutions. Results also indicated that employ a suitable co-payment system should comply with the medical triage system for therapy, which may increase the effective utilization of medical resources. These results identified specific social factors related to the developed indicators that managers should consider the diversification of sustainable management. The identification of these factors can contribute to more integrative social analyses to improve a better quality of life.",

Although IoT-based patient health status monitoring has become very popular, monitoring patients remotely outside of hospital settings requires augmenting the capabilities of IoT with other resources for health data storage and processing. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based service-oriented framework for continuous patient health status monitoring framework that connects WBAN through smartphones to cloud computing. We theoretically model the proposed framework, which is the first attempt in this direction, and study the behaviour of the proposed IoT--WBANs-based framework. Experimental evaluation based on the sensor lifetime, existing cost and energy consumption shows that the proposed framework substantially outperforms the baseline WBANs.",

abstract="Recently, the significance of internet of things (IoT) is rapidly growing in the next generation of information and communication technology due to rapid advances in wireless communication technologies which have triggered the development of low-power, reliable and miniaturized devices. These advances lead to the creation of IoT ecosystem that enables development of various services. Especially, there are a number of attempts to apply communication technology of IoT in the field of healthcare services which deals with medical applications such as a remote medical treatment. In IoT-based healthcare system, in general, a number of medical devices are densely deployed in narrow area. Therefore, they are exposed to signal interference among them which causes significant performance degradation. In this paper, we present an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based network interface and channel selection algorithm for multi-channel MAC protocols in IoT ecosystem that take into account a multitude of decision factors, such as expected channel condition, latency and frame reception ratio. The proposed scheme can provide flexibility for various requirements of different medical services through performing AHP. In particular, the proposed scheme considers IoT-based healthcare system because it is the most complex scenario of fundamental IoT applications. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive simulations, and the simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm provides low latency and high reliability.",

Big data has become a very popular topic in healthcare, where the term primarily refers to the vast and growing volumes of computerized medical information available in the form of electronic health records, administrative or health claims data, disease and drug monitoring registries and so on. This kind of data is generally collected routinely during administrative processes and clinical practice by different healthcare professionals: from doctors recording their patients' medical history, drug prescriptions or medical claims to pharmacists registering dispensed prescriptions. For a long time, this data accumulated without its value being fully recognized and leveraged. Today big data has an important place in healthcare, including in pharmacovigilance. The expanding role of big data in pharmacovigilance includes signal detection, substantiation and validation of drug or vaccine safety signals, and increasingly new sources of information such as social media are also being considered. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the uses of big data for drug safety post-marketing assessment.",

ADR prevalence is 6.7 {\%} throughout hospitals worldwide, with an international death rate of 0.32 {\%} of the total of the patients. This rate is even higher in Ambient Assisted Living environments, where 15 {\%} of the patients suffer clinically significant interactions due to patient non-compliance to drug dosage and schedule of intake in addition to suffering from polypharmacy. These instances increase with age and cause risks of drug interactions, adverse effects, and toxicity. However, with a tight follow-up of the drug treatment, complications of incorrect drug use can be reduced. For that purpose, we propose an innovative system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for the drug identification and the monitoring of medication. IoT is applied to examine drugs in order to fulfill treatment, to detect harmful side effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, liver/renal contradictions, and harmful side effects during pregnancy. The IoT design acknowledges that the aforementioned problems are worldwide so the solution supports several IoT identification technologies: barcode, Radio Frequency Identification, Near Field Communication, and a new solution developed for low-income countries based on IrDA in collaboration with the World Health Organization. These technologies are integrated in personal devices such as smart-phones, PDAs, PCs, and in our IoT-based personal healthcare device called Movital.",

In the system, we use a local binary pattern (LBP) and a co-occurrence matrix from the region of interest (where there is a possible mass) of the mammogram image. Several features are extracted from the LBP and the matrix to describe the mass. A support vector machine is used as a classifier.

To gather rich information indicator of our mental and physical health, IoT based sensors are either worn on the body or embedded in the living environment. Moreover, by incorporating the mobile computing technology in IoT based healthcare systems, the reactive care system can be transformed to proactive and preventive healthcare systems. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT based smart student m-healthcare monitoring framework is proposed. This framework computes the student diseases severity by predicting the potential disease with its level by temporally mining the health measurements collected from medical and other IoT devices. To effectively analyze the student healthcare data, an architectural model for smart student health care system has been designed. In our case study, health dataset of 182 suspected students are simulated to generate relevant waterborne diseses cases. This data is further analyzed to validate our model by using k-cross validation approach. Pattern based diagnosis scheme is applied using various classification algorithms and then results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and response time. Experimental results show that Decision tree (C4.5) and k-neighest neighbour algorithms perform better as compared to other classifiers in terms of above mentioned parameters. Moreover, the proposed methodology is effective in decision making by delivering time sensitive information to caretaker or doctor within specific time. Lastly, the temporal granule pattern based presentation reterives effective diagnosis results for the proposed system.",

abstract="This paper presents a systematic literature review of papers that were published in academic journals on the applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) in supply chain management between the years 2000 and 2015. As the literature on RFID is not confined to specific disciplines or repositories, this paper proposes a discipline-based framework for classifying RFID literature. Five main classification categories are used in this paper: technology, supply chain management, research methodology, application industries, and social aspects. The paper then focuses on the category of supply chain management and reviews 1187 articles that were published between 2000 and 2015 in rated journals. All the papers reviewed are further classified into eight subclasses under this category of supply chain management. The review yields useful insights into the anatomy of RFID literature in supply chain management, enhances evidence-based knowledge, and contributes to informing practice, policymaking and future research. The review reveals that even presently, despite technical and cost challenges, enormous potential exists for the application of RFID in several areas of supply chain management and the prospects are likely to grow into the future. Since RFID solutions have emerged primarily over only the past 20 years, significant research opportunities exist and would need to be addressed to continue to support the technology's maturation, evaluation, adoption, implementation, and diffusion.",

abstract="Electrocardiogram (ECG) as one of the best methods to measure irregular heartbeats is a dispensable method for doctor to diagnose Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients. Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of Door to Balloon (D2B) time, which is defined as the time interval starting when an Acute--Myocardial-Infarction patient arrives at the Emergency Department, and ending when a catheter guide wire crosses the culprit lesion as the acute-myocardial-infarction treatment on the patient in the cardiac catheterization room. Generally, when a patient with acute-chest pain is sent into a hospital (always to Emergency Department), the hospital will collect his/her ECG which needs to be evaluated by a cardiologist to ensure that the patient really has Acute Myocardial Infarction. Then the medical workers deliver the patient to the cardiac catheterization room to operate balloon angioplasty. In previous years, the cardiologist must utilize a PC to connect to the Intranet of the hospital and employ a special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can check the patient's ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since the doctor may stay outdoors and he/she needs some time to find a PC and network. Of course, if the PC has not installed the PACS image browser, the doctor has to download and install it. Consequently, the D2B time should be worsened, thus possibly impacting the patient's life. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a Cloud-based Electrocardiogram System, with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG so as to shorten the D2B time. This system has been online in a medical center in middle Taiwan for more than one year. The shortened D2B time is longer than 10 min, i.e., receiving fine results.",

This study presents a miniature wearable cardiopulmonary monitoring system called ``Smart Chest Strap,'' which consists of an elastic band worn around the user's chest with integrated sensors, a physiological signals acquisition unit, and a mobile phone. The physiological signals including electrocardiogram, respiratory inductance plethysmograph, and accelerations (ACC) are sampled, digitalized, stored, and simultaneously transmitted to a mobile phone via Bluetooth. A medical validation test with participants performing discontinuous incremental treadmill (0--12 km/h) exercise was conducted. The results indicate nearly perfect correlations (0.999, 0.996, 0.994), small mean bias (0.60 BPM, 0.51 BPM, 0.05 g), and narrow limits of agreement ({\textpm}2.90 BPM, {\textpm}1.81 BPM, {\textpm}0.09 g) for heart rate (HR), breathing rate (BR), and ACC represented as vector magnitude units (VMUs). There is a general trend of decrease in accuracy, precision, and correlation for HR, BR, and VMU as velocity increases, but these validity statistics are all within acceptable error limits and clinically accepted. The findings demonstrate that the Smart Chest Strap is valid and will have wider applications in healthcare, sports, and scientific research areas.",

abstract="To enhance the quality of medical care, e-healthcare system becomes a promising system which integrates diverse wireless devices and technologies such as internet of things, wireless body area networks, etc. However, numerous wireless devices and communication requirements will cause the shortage of the wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio is able to exploit spectrum opportunities and increase the communication performance for the e-healthcare system. To access the spectrum safely, the security aspect of spectrum utilization should be carefully addressed. A well-known threat to the spectrum utilization is the primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in which the attackers emulate as the primary users to obtain spectrum opportunities. To defend this threat, in this paper, we propose a triple threshold energy detection (TTED) to identify the PUEA. Based on the TTED, legitimate devices are allowed to access the available channels when the licensed channel is idle or occupied by attackers. To evaluate our proposed access scheme, we derive the achievable throughput while the average transmission time is fixed and exponential distributed, respectively.",

Excessive diagnosis issue is expected to be significantly reduced if establishing the easily configurable IoT server, communication with medical devices, and communication among hospitals by transmitting medical results to users. With the advancement of hacking technology, many hackers are interested in medical information and medical infrastructure, and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) is expanding in Korea. A number of medical ISMS projects are discussed, based on ISO 27791 standards derived from ISO 27001 standards. Large hospitals in South Korea have a variety of platforms that misrepresent personal information, and various platforms deal with sensitive medical information, but small and medium-sized hospitals use platforms that are not considered legal considerations.In this paper, we intend to establish a legal information sharing platform, which is legally considered legally limited and is responsible for the safety of the medical information.In the IoT server with limited resources, light-weighted and user-friendly protocols are frequently utilized over those that derive traffic and consume much resource. Under these circumstances, this study is intended to suggest IoT network that medical devices are able to create ubiquitous environment for users by utilizing simple service discovery protocol as a protocol provided without imposing much burden on limited resources and highly secured extensible messaging and presence protocol.",

The medical data of patients is collected by sensors and transmitted using wireless communication techniques. Different users can access the patient's data with different privileges. Access control is a crucial problem in WBANs. In this paper, we design a new security mechanism named combined public-key scheme in the case of attribute-based (CP-ABES) to address the user access control in WBANs. Our scheme combines encryption and digital signatures. It uses ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to achieve data confidentially, access control, and ciphertext-policy attribute-based signature to realize the identity authentication. The access policy used in our scheme is threshold. Based on this feature, the length of ciphertext and signature of our scheme is constant. Our scheme provides confidentiality, unforgeability, signer privacy and collusion resistance. We prove the efficiency of our scheme theoretically and analyze the security level and energy consumption of our scheme.",

These solutions can also play an important part in intelligent environments, facilitating real-time data collection and input to enable various functionalities. However, there are several challenges regarding the development of mHealth solutions: the most important of these being privacy and data security. Furthermore, the use of cloud computing is becoming an option for the healthcare sector to store healthcare data; but storing data in the cloud raises serious concerns. This paper investigates how data are managed both on mHealth devices as well as in the cloud. Firstly, a detailed analysis of the entire mHealth domain is undertaken to determine domain-specific features and a taxonomy for mHealth, from which a set of security requirements are identified in order to develop a new information security framework. It then examines individual information security frameworks for mHealth devices and the cloud, noting similarities and differences.

The information is transmitted in internet of things (IOT) environment, which can be eavesdrop. Thus, it is essential to ensure that only authorized shareholders can access the transmitted information. Authentication and key agreement protocols are developed to ensure confidentiality and security in IOT. We design a biometric based authentication and key agreement protocol for WSNs. To analyze the security of the proposed protocol, we use formal security proof, which shows that an attacker has a negligible probability of breaking the protocol security. We also use the BAN logic technique to show the correctness of mutual authentication. Additionally, we adopt an informal analysis to discuss the resistance of proposed scheme against various possible attacks on authentication protocols. Additionally, through the comparison of computational efficiency and security attributes with recent results, proposed protocol seems to be more appropriate for WSNs.",

abstract="With the rising trend of the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases all over the world, proactive healthcare systems with wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have attracted people's extensive attention. One of the researches, such as routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) only takes into consideration a single metric, energy, hops or routing quality, and so on. To extend the survival time of the network effectively and maximize the utilization of energy, we need to consider both node metric and link metric that affect the network, and design IRPL (Improved RPL) protocol. We propose the life cycle index (LCI) as path selection objective function. The index takes node metric (node energy and node hops) and link metric (throughput, packet loss, link quality) into consideration. In order to detect and distribute congestion information, we add congestion detection factor to the index. According to node energy, hop and congestion detection factor, we optimize the calculation method of rank. Our method redesigns parent node selection strategy. Not only does the strategy select the best parent node by using the improved index, but also saves other parent nodes that meet the conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a multipath scheme by using the DODAG structure, and use the scheme to solve the congestion problem. The simulation results show that the scheme shows better performance in terms of network load, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, percentage of the optimal parent node change, energy consumption and network lifetime.",

abstract="eHealth is supported by electronic processes and communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) is utilized to realize smart healthcare, backup terminal devices are required for reliable eHealth services, and the IoT control system is essential for the security of IoT applications. In 2013, Yang et al. first added backup terminal devices, a status monitor device and an alarm module to the IoT control system and proposed an authentication mechanism for availability and security. In 2016, Chang et al. found that Yang et al.'s authentication model suffers from some drawbacks. In this paper, we adjust the operation and requirements of the IoT control system and take user anonymity into consideration to propose an authentication model for the IoT control system for reliable and anonymous eHealth services. To ensure anonymity of the user and the accessed service, the real identifiers will not be transmitted for untraceability. The proposed authentication model complies with six essential requirements. Via the proposed authentication model, the IoT control system can ensure reliable and anonymous eHealth services with anonymity, availability and security.",

abstract="In an earlier paper (Tien 2015), the author defined the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance. Finally, just as the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age on October 4, 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the U. S. has inaugurated an age of automata or autonomous vehicles that can be considered to be the U. S. Sputnik of servgoods, with the full support of the U. S. government, the U. S. auto industry, the U. S. electronic industry, and the U.S. higher educational enterprise.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) technologies allow everyday objects including small devices in sensor networks to be capable of connecting to the Internet. Such an innovative technology can lead to positive changes in human life. However, if there is no proper security mechanism, private and sensitive data around humans can be revealed to the public Internet. In this aspect, this paper considers security issues of the IoT. In particular, we focus on various challenges in deploying Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol into a resource constrained environment. DTLS provides secure communication with UDP-based applications the same as TLS does for TCP-based applications. Several standard organizations such as IETF, oneM2M and OMA recommend using the DTLS as a default secure scheme for CoAP which is a new standard specified for resource-constrained environments. To find a practical way to deploy the DTLS in such a constrained IoT environments, we propose an IoT--Cloud collaboration system, where DTLS handshake delegation is the main component. We also implement and evaluate the proposed system in our real IoT testbed, where constrained devices are interconnected with each other in a multi-hop fashion. Evaluation results show that the proposed scheme dramatically reduces DTLS handshake latency, implementation code size and energy consumption.",

The communication between smaller IoT devices has added to the accuracy and convenience of distance healthcare services. However, security issues in communication sessions resulting from the leakage of personal medical information, infringements of privacy and improper management of medical information are looming large. Since personal medical information is transmitted between wire/wireless devices, the threats to secure distance medical service could be detrimental to further advancement of IoT in healthcare. Hence, this paper proposed a method of addressing the vulnerabilities to a range of attacks in the communication between medical devices. The proposed IoT-based communication protocol used random numbers and session keys to transmit hashed and encrypted data, and underwent a formal verification, where the transmitted data remained intact against data extraction and other attacks.",

The synchronous operation between the real shop-floor frontline and virtual production management system is vital in the establishment of smart factories. However, managing a wide variety of sensing devices and processing the large amount of raw captured manufacturing data are difficult for general production operators. In this article, the Coloured Petri net (CPN) technology is combined with IoT technologies to establish an active sensing system of real-time and multi-source manufacturing information (CPN-MIASS). It aims to establish a systematic graphics-based modelling approach for the sensing of manufacturing information and the management of sensor, which can assist the general operators in monitoring and controlling the real-time manufacturing process easily and dynamically. Based on this system and its key components, the multiple sensors can be managed in a `Plug-and-play' manner, and the high-level manufacturing information can be obtained efficiently. In addition, a prototype system is used to validate the usability of the proposed CPN-MIASS.",

Moreover, it is not easy to harmonize things of related action with added or removed devices to aid process being conducted by human or services of applications. In this paper, we propose a concept for supporting a collaboration augmentation of devices used in the IoT. The Device-Rank for the augmenting collaboration of things proposed in this paper is a technology used to rate IoT things based on diverse elements such as the frequency with which users use individual things, the distances to users or service objects, the network QoS, the performance of the things, and their operation histories, such that the resultant information can be used by a cloud-based platform or device itself to calculate the Device-Rank information. This Device-Rank is expected to be accumulated and updated by things or a platform, and exchanged between things such that things can more actively collaborate with other things or services and augment the Device-Rank with the passing of time.",

abstract="Recent real medical datasets show that the number of outpatients in China has sharply increased since 2013, when the Chinese health insurance reform started. This situation leads to increased waiting time for the outpatients; in particular, the normal operation of a hospital will be congested at rush hour. The existence of this problem in outpatient departments causes a reduction in doctors' diagnostic time, and a high working strength is required to address this issue. In this paper, a simultaneous model based on machine learning is proposed for aiding outpatient doctors in performing diagnoses. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) to classify hyperlipemia using the clinical features extracted from a real medical dataset. The results, with an accuracy of 90 {\%}, indicate that our Simultaneously Aided Diagnosis Model (SADM) applied to aid diagnosis for outpatient doctors and achieves the objective of increasing efficiency and reducing working strength.",

The flexibility offered through big data analytics empowers functional as well as firm-level performance. In the first phase of the study, we attempt to analyze the research on big data published in high-quality business management journals. The analysis was visualized using tools for big data and text mining to understand the dominant themes and how they are connected. Subsequently, an industry-specific categorization of the studies was done to understand the key use cases. It was found that most of the existing research focuses majorly on consumer discretionary, followed by public administration. Methodologically, a major focus in such exploration is in social media analytics, text mining and machine learning applications for meeting objectives in marketing and supply chain management. However, it was found that not much focus was highlighted in these studies to demonstrate the tools used for the analysis. To address this gap, this study also discusses the evolution, types and usage of big data tools. The brief overview of big data technologies grouped by the services they enable and some of their applications are presented. The study categorizes these tools into big data analysis platforms, databases and data warehouses, programming languages, search tools, and data aggregation and transfer tools. Finally, based on the review, future directions for exploration in big data has been provided for academic and practice.              ",

pages="180--193",
abstract="This paper proposes a simple terminology for understanding and dealing with two current phenomena; we suggest calling them heavyweight and lightweight IT. Heavyweight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT. The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT should be only loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation.",

Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and `silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.",

abstract="The technology of IoT combined with medical systems is expected to support advanced medical services. However, unsolved security problems, such as misuse of medical devices, illegal access to the medical server and so on, make IoT-based medical systems not be applied widely. In addition, users have a high burden of computation to access Things for the explosive growth of IoT devices. Because medical information is critical and important, but users have a restricted computing power, IoT-based medical systems are required to provide secure and efficient authentication for users. In this paper, we propose a selective group authentication scheme using Shamir's threshold technique. The property of selectivity gives the right of choice to users to form a group which consists of things users select and access. And users can get an access authority for those Things at a time. Thus, our scheme provides an efficient user authentication for multiple Things and conditional access authority for safe IoT-based medical information system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first in which selectivity is combined with group authentication in IoT environments.",

abstract="Medication adherence is essential for the success of home care. However, it is hard to achieve in reality. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional medication assistance system that is composed of a sensor-enabled pill box and a photo message system. While most of the existing medication assistance systems enhance medication adherence by properly alerting the patients; our bidirectional system does it by the enhancement of information sharing and communications between patients and medical staff. The medication dosage states of a patient are detected by a hall-effect sensor attached to the lid of an off-the-shelf pill box. The sensor data is transferred over a ZigBee network located in the patient's home and is stored in a cloud database through a 3G mobile network. Since the raw sensor data might contain erroneous open-close events of the pill box, we developed a data filtering function to eliminate the false-positive events. With the data filtering function, we improved the accuracy of medication monitoring from 60{\%} to 85{\%} during our three-month experiment involving seven patients. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the photo message system that home visiting nurses can use to communicate with the patient. The missed medication ratio was improved from 15{\%} to 4{\%} after the photo message system was installed. The effectiveness of the photo message system continued for two months after the initiation. We also interviewed 15 medical staff about the effectiveness of the medication monitoring with the sensor-enabled pill box and the photo message system.",

abstract="The world is confronted with a variety of interdependent problems, including scarcity, unsustainability, inequality, pollution and poor governance. Tackling such complex challenges requires coordinated action. The present paper proposes the development of a self-organizing system for coordination, called an ``offer network'', that would use the distributed intelligence of the Internet to match the offers and needs of all human, technological and natural agents on the planet. This would maximize synergy and thus minimize waste and scarcity of resources. Implementing such coordination requires a protocol that formally defines agents, offers, needs, and the network of condition-action rules or reactions that interconnect them. Matching algorithms can then determine self-sustaining subnetworks in which each consumed resource (need) is also produced (offer). After sketching the elements of a mathematical foundation for offer networks, the paper proposes a roadmap for their practical implementation. This includes step-by-step integration with technologies such as the Semantic Web, ontologies, the Internet of Things, reputation and recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, governance through legal constraints and nudging, and ecosystem modeling. The resulting intelligent platform should be able to tackle nearly all practical and theoretical problems in a bottom-up, distributed manner, thus functioning like a Global Brain for humanity.",

abstract="The successful use of intelligent agents in healthcare has attracted researchers to apply this emerging software engineering paradigm in more advanced and complex applications. Main success factor is the natural mapping of real world medical problems into cyber world. Multi-agent architecture can easily model the heterogeneous, distributed and autonomous health care systems. The multi agent systems have been applied from single healthcare activity like knowledge based medical system to complex, multi-component based systems like complete healthcare unit. The use of multi agent systems in health care domain has also opened the ways to find out new applications like personalized and socialized health care systems. This versatile use of multi agent systems has also posed new problems for researchers like; security, communication, and different social issues. This work reviews recent years' research and applications of multi agent systems in healthcare published in different research journals, international conferences, and implemented practically. We reviewed five subdomains and three systems in each subdomain. A set of common parameters of these systems has been extracted and compared to analyze systems' merits and deficiencies. Based on our analysis, we have provided recommendations for multi agent systems applied in healthcare domain. Future research directions for interested researchers and practitioners are also discussed. As our own future research work, we intend to study healthcare and multi agent systems in e-commerce.",

As a solution, we propose the concept of Managed Ecosystem of Networked Objects, which aims to create a smart network architecture for groups of Internet-connected objects by combining network virtualization and clean-slate end-to-end protocol design. The concept maps to many real-life scenarios and should empower application developers to use sensor data in an easy and natural way.

abstract="As healthcare is one of major socioeconomic problems in cities, mobile healthcare network becomes one of core components of smart cities, which would improve urban healthcare environment. However, there are wide privacy concerns as personal health information is outsourced to untrusted cloud servers. It is a promising method to encrypt the health data before outsourcing, but how to do diagnosis computations on the encrypted health data remains an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a general architecture of the mobile healthcare network, and define three typical secure medical computations, which include the average heart rate, the long QT syndrome detection, and the chi-square tests. To achieve computations on the ciphertext, we leverage fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt the health data. Different from previous related works, we use more efficient Dowlin's FHE scheme to implement above three medical computations. In our implementation of the average heart rate, only one ciphertext is sent back to the receiver, so homomorphic decryption is needed once. We take an efficient l-bits comparator to implement the long QT syndrome detection, which only needs l XOR operations and one homomorphic multiplication. We first implement the chi-square tests by homomorphic additions and homomorphic multiplications, which can be used to study whether varicose veins is relevant to overweight. Extensive simulations and analytical results show the scalability and efficiency of our proposed scheme.",

abstract="Internet of things technology has recently drawn much attention across industries. IoT technology has gradually been applied to industries and everyday life in general including healthcare, where people can access hospital information systems to view personal health and medical information. Still, due to security vulnerabilities, personal health and medical information is prone to hacking attacks. Thus, concerns over privacy invasion have come to the fore, and at the same time security issues are considered to override information services. This paper proposes a communication protocol based on hash lock, session keys, random numbers and security keys designed to be safe against intruders' hacking attempts in information communication between medical devices. Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program. In brief, the proposed communication protocol for medical devices is safe and secure against diverse attacks.",

Against this backdrop, this study adapts an established research framework to structure the insights of the current body of research on blockchain technology, outline the present research scope as well as disregarded topics, and sketch out multidisciplinary research approaches. The framework differentiates three groups of activities (design and features, measurement and value, management and organization) at four levels of analysis (users and society, intermediaries, platforms, firms and industry). The review shows that research has predominantly focused on technological questions of design and features, while neglecting application, value creation, and governance. In order to foster substantial blockchain research that addresses meaningful questions, this study identifies several avenues for future studies.

abstract="We describe an ontological model for representation and integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) data and apply it to detect human emotional states. The model (BIO{\_}EMOTION) is an ontology-based context model for emotion recognition and acts as a basis for: (1) the modeling of users' contexts, including user profiles, EEG data, the situation and environment factors, and (2) supporting reasoning on the users' emotional states. Because certain ontological concepts in the EEG domain are ill-defined, we formally represent and store these concepts, their taxonomies and high-level representation (i.e., rules) in the model. To evaluate the effectiveness for inferring emotional states, DEAP dataset is used for model reasoning. Result shows that our model reaches an average recognition ratio of 75.19 {\%} on Valence and 81.74 {\%} on Arousal for eight participants. As mentioned above, the BIO-EMOTION model acts like a bridge between users' emotional states and low-level bio-signal features. It can be integrated in user modeling techniques, and be used to model web users' emotional states in human-centric web aiming to provide active, transparent, safe and reliable services to users. This work aims at, in other words, creating an ontology-based context model for emotion recognition using EEG. Particularly, this model completely implements the loop body of the W2T data cycle once: from low-level EEG feature acquisition to emotion recognition. A long-term goal for the study is to complete this model to implement the whole W2T data cycle.",

Information handover among medical staff can also introduce human errors which may place a patient's health and life at risk. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a kind of electronic identification technology that is becoming widely deployed.

abstract="The internet of things (IoT) attracts great interest in many application domains concerned with monitoring and control of physical phenomena. However, application development is still one of the main hurdles to a wide adoption of IoT technology. Application development is done at a low level, very close to the operating system and requires programmers to focus on low-level system issues. The underlying APIs can be very complicated and the amount of data collected can be huge. This can be very hard to deal with as a developer. In this paper, we present a runtime model based approach to IoT application development. First, the manageability of sensor devices is abstracted as runtime models that are automatically connected with the corresponding systems. Second, a customized model is constructed according to a personalized application scenario and the synchronization between the customized model and sensor device runtime models is ensured through model transformation. Thus, all the application logic can be carried out by executing programs on the customized model. An experiment on a real-world application scenario demonstrates the feasibility, effectiveness, and benefits of the new approach to IoT application development.",

abstract="A combination of big data and predictive analytics orchestrated through the Internet of Things (IoT) offers many opportunities for researchers in Information Systems, Operations Management and Strategy to look at old problems in new ways, and to identify completely new research areas. While there is much hype, little research has been conducted that informs companies about how to profitably integrate the IoT with strategic or operational processes. This paper views the IoT through the lens of predictive maintenance -- the use of real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to dynamically manage preventive maintenance policies. These are being used by numerous manufacturing organizations to transition from product-oriented to service-oriented business models. In particular, we analyze optimal preventive maintenance policies in an environment where equipment is subject to a deterioration, which shifts it from its initial, fully-productive state, having a specified, age-dependent failure rate to a less-productive or deteriorated state, having a different, presumably higher, age-dependent failure rate. The deterioration, itself, is a random process.",

abstract="In a critical environment, e.g. in a factory where an employee faces hazardous conditions, monitoring the health status of the employee is important. Thus, continuous connectivity of the employee to the network is the main concern of such networks. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in hazardous areas like factory. The proposed mobility structure for hazardous areas, called MSHA, organizes static nodes as a tree for an efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. MSHA is capable of handling multiple failures of static nodes which disconnect a mobile node from the network. MSHA is highly scalable regarding the number of mobile nodes and the size of the covered monitoring area. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on different factors. The results reveal the superiority of MSHA compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the performance (about 20{\%}) of MSHA specifically in reducing packet loss and hand-off delay caused by the failure of the static nodes. The performance does not degrade with increasing the number of mobile nodes.",

Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called ``Big Data.'' Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called ``Intelligent Building,'' depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system has the capability of efficiently processing WBAN sensory data from millions of users in order to perform real-time responses in case of emergencies.",

abstract="As IoT technology evolves, developments of ubiquitous computing accelerates. At the same time, threats of privacy exposure also increase since the IoT systems expose the information such as user's location or medical status collected from all sorts of things. To handle the data elaborately, the ubiquitous systems need to employ a technology that provides anonymity to prevent exposure of personal information. The group signature scheme is widely used for a cryptographic base for privacy protection which do not reveal user's identity but prove that he/she is a legitimate user. Recently, a number of researches concerning the basic group signature schemes with a differentiated linkability have been conducted to provide a more flexible service. However, existing researches focused on providing flexible services from the service provider's position. The systems are exposed to high possibilities of unnecessary breach of privacy. In this paper, we define a restrictive linkability for the anonymous services that require an adequate linkability with a minimum user-designated privacy exposure in anonymous services and propose an efficient group signature scheme providing restrictive linkability.",

abstract="In many Internet of Things scenarios, a large amount of sensor data is continuously produced and exchanged among devices in smart environments. Handling these data causes great challenges since their processing must occur in a timely manner. Furthermore, the exchanged data must be kept at a minimum in order to efficiently use network resources of constrained devices. Complex event processing (CEP) is an established approach frequently employed to address these challenges. There are many existing means to automatically provision CEP systems, such as Docker or Ansible. However, the resulting instances are generic and need customization to be applied to Internet of Things scenarios. More precisely, data sources and sinks need to be bound and queries need to be defined. This customization is a tedious task when conducted manually.

abstract="Recently, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication systems are found in various user-friendly services that all of us deal with in our daily lives. As these systems are ubiquitously deployed in different authentication and identification applications, inferring information about our behavior will be possible by monitoring our use of them. In order to provide privacy and security requirements of RFID users in novel authentication applications, lots of security schemes have been proposed which have tried to provide secure and untraceable communication for end-users. In this paper, we investigate the privacy of three RFID security schemes which have been proposed recently. For privacy analysis, we use the well-known RFID formal privacy model proposed by Ouafi and Phan. We show that all the studied protocols have some privacy drawbacks, making them vulnerable to various traceability attacks. Moreover, in order to overcome all the reported weaknesses and prevent the presented attacks, we apply some modifications in the structures of the studied protocols and propose an improved version of each one. Our analyses show that the modified protocols are more efficient than their previous versions and new modifications can omit all the existing weaknesses on the analyzed protocols. Finally, we compare the modified protocols with some new-found RFID authentication protocols in the terms of security and privacy.",

abstract="A smart city can utilize information and communication technologies to minimize energy, waste, and resource consumption and attain high-efficiency services, so it directly improves the life quality of all residents. However, it also brings about some security and privacy challenges. For instance, once the ubiquitous network in the smart city is attacked, all of the sensitive information and residents' identities will be revealed. In many application scenarios, the anonymity of residents is a desirable security property. After all, nobody wants to be traced for his daily activity or personal habits. In this paper, we propose a generic identity-based broadcast encryption scheme which can satisfy information's confidentiality and users' anonymity simultaneously under chosen-ciphertext attacks. What is different from our previous work which was published in ACISP 2016 is that we present the proof of confidentiality and focus on the application environment. The generic IBBE construction has a desirable property that its public parameter size and private key size are constant as well as its decryption cost is independent of the number of receivers. Thus, no matter from which point of views, the construction is very appropriate for smart city information system.",

abstract="In current times, multimedia application includes integrated sensors, mobile networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services. In IoT services, if more devices are connected without much constrains, the problem of security, trust and privacy remain a challenge. For multimedia communications through Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), sensor nodes transmit confidential data to the gateway nodes via public channels. In such an environment, the security remains a serious issue from past many years. Only few works are available to support secure multimedia communications performed in IoT-enabled WSNs. Among the few works, Kumari and Om recently proposed an authentication protocol for multimedia communications in IoT-enabled WSNs, which is applicable in coal mine for safety monitoring. The authors claimed in their work that their contributory protocol strongly withstands several security threats such as, user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack, sensor node anonymity issue and others technical design issues. However, this article proved that Kumari and Om's protocol has some design flaws and is susceptible to various security attacks including, user and sensor node impersonation attacks. As a remedy, a robust authentication protocol using smartcard is constructed to solve the security issues found in Kumari and Om's protocol. The proof of correctness of mutual authentication is performed using the BAN logic model. In addition, our further security investigation claimed strong protection against known security attacks. Our protocol is analyzed comprehensively and compared against the similar protocols and the results showed that it is efficient and robust than earlier protocols.",

To realise this, service oriented architectures and the emerging IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) standard are identified as key paradigms. One of the main elements to succeed any service oriented approach is a proficient service discovery protocol. In this paper, we propose EADP: an efficient protocol to announce and discover services in 6LoWPAN networks. EADP adopts a fully distributed approach using an adaptive push--pull model to ensure fast discovery times, low energy consumption and low generated overhead with timely reaction to network dynamics. EADP achieves this by using context-awareness information, delivered by a trickle algorithm. EADP was implemented and evaluated in Contiki using the Cooja simulator. Simulation results show EADP's capability to realise fast discovery times with low cost in terms of energy and overhead. These achievements make EADP very suitable for pervasive LLN applications.",

abstract="Nowadays, big media healthcare data processing in cloud has become an effective solution for satisfying QoS demands of medical users. It can support various healthcare services such as pre-processing, storing, sharing, and analysis of monitored data as well as acquiring context-awareness. However, to support energy and cost savings, the union of cloud data centers termed as cloud confederation can be an promising approach, which helps a cloud provider to overcome the limitation of physical resources. However, the key challenge in it is to achieve multiple contradictory objectives, e.g., meeting the required level of services defined in service level agreement, maintaining medial users'application QoS, etc. while maximizing profit of a cloud provider. In this paper, for executing heterogeneous big healthcare data processing requests from users, we develop a local and global cloud confederation model, namely FnF, that makes an optimal selection decision for target cloud data center(s) by exploiting Fuzzy logic. The FnF trades off in between profit of cloud provider and user application QoS in selecting federated data center(s). In addition, FnF enhances its decision accuracy by precisely estimating the resource requirements for the big data processing tasks using multiple linear regression. The proposed FnF model is validated through numerical as well as experimental evaluations. Simulation results depict the effectiveness and efficiency of the FnF model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

abstract="Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the European economy. A critical challenge faced by SME leaders, as a consequence of the continuing digital technology revolution, is how to optimally align business strategy with digital technology to fully leverage the potential offered by these technologies in pursuit of longevity and growth. There is a paucity of empirical research examining how e-leadership in SMEs drives successful alignment between business strategy and digital technology fostering longevity and growth. To address this gap, in this paper we develop an empirically derived e-leadership model. Initially we develop a theoretical model of e-leadership drawing on strategic alignment theory. This provides a theoretical foundation on how SMEs can harness digital technology in support of their business strategy enabling sustainable growth. An in-depth empirical study was undertaken interviewing 42 successful European SME leaders to validate, advance and substantiate our theoretically driven model. The outcome of the two stage process -- inductive development of a theoretically driven e-leadership model and deductive advancement to develop a complete model through in-depth interviews with successful European SME leaders -- is an e-leadership model with specific constructs fostering effective strategic alignment. The resulting diagnostic model enables SME decision makers to exercise effective e-leadership by creating productive alignment between business strategy and digital technology improving longevity and growth prospects.",

abstract="Mobile crowd sensing significantly facilitates a broad range of emerging applications by treating mobile devices of ordinary users as basic sensing units to distribute sensing tasks and collect sensing data. Owing to the continuity of data sensing and richness of content, resource-constrained mobile devices always outsource their collected data into the cloud for file sharing. The existing work enables only batch decryption limited to RSA algorithm and merely allows one specific file to be shared among multiple authorized receivers by exploiting the technique of attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this paper, a generalized efficient batch cryptosystem GBC and its extension GBCS are firstly proposed to achieve both batch encryption and batch decryption from any public key encryption algorithm. Then, our proposed GBC is further extended to FMFS, TMFS and MMFS to address secure multiple file sharing in the cloud-assisted mobile crowd sensing network, respectively for fine-grained multi-receiver multi-file sharing, file authority transfer and multiple file owners's settings. Finally, formal security proof is given to show our proposed generalized efficient batch cryptosystems GBC, GBCS and secure multiple file sharing schemes are respectively secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2) in the random oracle model and under the assumption on the computational hardness of the subset decision problem in the standard model. Extensive evaluations illustrate our secure multiple file sharing in cloud-assisted crowd sensing network based on the newly-devised GBC dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art in storage, computational and communication overhead.",

However, as news and multimedia data are scattered in a wide variety of forms, it is very difficult to select appropriate ones for the learner. In this paper, we propose a news and related multimedia recommendation scheme based on IoT for supporting NIE lessons. Specifically, news and related multimedia data are collected from the Web, and they are integrated and stored into the server. After that, the learner can easily browse such contents using a mobile device through personalized visualization, which increase the efficiency of NIE lessons.

Since IEEE 802.15.4, suitable for wireless sensor networks, has the prominent advantages such as the low cost and low energy consumption, it is helpful for variety fields that are sources of Internet of Things. They include healthcare monitoring, industrial application, smart grid, home automation, and many energy-critical application suffered from limited resources. In response, many studies have proposed energy efficient solutions, however, they may waste energy as ever. It is because they do not consider the contentions in multi-coordinator environments then the frequent packet collisions are followed by retransmission which consumed unnecessary energy. In this respect, we proposed a new and simply implementable contention mitigation scheme to enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes by reducing the contention degree among neighboring coordinators. In the proposed scheme, the coordinators recognize the network state by exchanging their information with each other. It leads that the coordinators isolate the superframe duration by staggering own beacon transmission. It can alleviate significant contentions among burst packets at the beginning of the superframe. Therefore, the proposed scheme reduces a lot of unnecessary wasted energy in the process of redundant retransmission. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing energy efficient solutions with regard to the network performance.",

pages="1263--1283",
abstract="In recent years, vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has emerged as a new technology which is being used in wide range of applications in the area of multimedia-based healthcare applications. In VCC, vehicles act as the intelligent machines which can be used to collect and transfer the healthcare data to the local, or global sites for storage, and computation purposes, as vehicles are having comparatively limited storage and computation power for handling the multimedia files. However, due to the dynamic changes in topology, and lack of centralized monitoring points, this information can be altered, or misused. These security breaches can result in disastrous consequences such as-loss of life or financial frauds. Therefore, to address these issues, a learning automata-assisted distributive intrusion detection system is designed based on clustering. Although there exist a number of applications where the proposed scheme can be applied but, we have taken multimedia-based healthcare application for illustration of the proposed scheme. In the proposed scheme, learning automata (LA) are assumed to be stationed on the vehicles which take clustering decisions intelligently and select one of the members of the group as a cluster-head. The cluster-heads then assist in efficient storage and dissemination of information through a cloud-based infrastructure. To secure the proposed scheme from malicious activities, standard cryptographic technique is used in which the auotmaton learns from the environment and takes adaptive decisions for identification of any malicious activity in the network. A reward and penalty is given by the stochastic environment where an automaton performs its actions so that it updates its action probability vector after getting the reinforcement signal from the environment. The proposed scheme was evaluated using extensive simulations on ns-2 with SUMO. The results obtained indicate that the proposed scheme yields an improvement of 10  {\%} in detection rate of malicious nodes when compared with the existing schemes.",

abstract="What are the critical requirements to be considered for the security measures in Internet of Things (IoT) services? Further, how should those security resources be allocated? To provide valuable insight into these questions, this paper introduces a security assessment framework for the IoT service environment from an architectural perspective. Our proposed framework integrates fuzzy DEMATEL and fuzzy ANP to reflect dependence and feedback interrelations among security criteria and, ultimately, to weigh and prioritize them. The results, gleaned from the judgments of 38 security experts, revealed that security design should put more importance on the service layer, especially to ensure availability and trust. We believe that these results will contribute to the provision of more secure and reliable IoT services.",

month="Nov",
day="16",
abstract="Outlier detection is critical for many applications such as healthcare, health insurance, medical diagnosis, predictive analytics, pattern recognition, intrusion detection, anomaly or defect detection, video surveillance, credit card fraud detection and text mining. Outlier detection techniques could be statistics, distance- or model based. Techniques, which are based on a single method for outlier detection usually have weaknesses and strengths and are mostly unstable. Outlier detection ensembles harness the strengths of individual detectors and result in stable performance. This paper presents a new parameter based growing self-organizing maps ensemble (GSOME) for outlier detection in multivariate patterns. For outlier detection, the proposed GSOME transforms non-linear relationships between high dimensional patterns into a simple 1D geometric relationship. Whatever the pattern dimensionality is, it is mapped to a single point of a line. The dispersion of mapped points will be used to locate the outliers and measure the degree of outlyingness. Several experiments on both real and synthetic data sets show the promising performance of the proposed GSOME.",

The routing protocol in the IoT environment is Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The current RPL specification defines primary security modes; therefore it is vulnerable to topological attacks. In this paper the RPL routing mechanism, its topological vulnerabilities and two important topological attacks namely version number attack and rank spoofing attack are analyzed. To counter the mentioned attacks, a lightweight Identity Based Offline--Online Signature based scheme is proposed. Our evaluation shows that our proposed scheme is secure in the random oracle model, and in terms of computational cost and energy consumption efficiently counters with these attacks.",

To address these issues, in this paper we present a new model of Internet of Things architecture which combines benefits of two emerging technologies: software-defined networking and Fog computing. Software-defined networking implies a logically centralized network control plane, which allows implementation of sophisticated mechanisms for traffic control and resource management. On the other hand, Fog computing enables some data to be analysed and managed at the network edge, thus providing support for applications that require very low and predictable latency. In the paper, we give detailed insight into the system structure and functionality of its main components. We also discuss the benefits of the proposed architecture and its potential services.",

The SmPHR was developed for Android 4.0.3, and implemented according to the optimized standard protocol for each interface of healthcare services adopted by the Continua Health Alliance (CHA). That is, the Personal Area Network (PAN) interface between the application and PHD implements ISO/IEEE 11073-20,601, 10,404, 10,407, 10,415, 10,417, and Bluetooth Health Device Profile (HDP), and EMRs with a wide area network (WAN) interface implement HL7 V2.6; the Health Record Network (HRN) interface implements Continuity of Care Document (CCD) and Continuity of Care Record (CCR). Also, for SmPHR, we evaluated the transmission error rate between the interface using four PHDs and personal health record systems (PHRs) from previous research, with 611 users and elderly people after receiving institutional review board (IRB) approval. In the evaluation, the PAN interface showed 15 (2.4 {\%}) errors, and the WAN and HRN interface showed 13 (2.1 {\%}) errors in a total of 611 transmission attempts. Also, we received opinions regarding SmPHR from 15 healthcare professionals who took part in the clinical trial. Thus, SmPHR can be provided as an interconnected PHR mobile health service to patients, allowing `plug and play' of PHDs and EMRs through various standard protocols.",

The rapid deployment of high-speed Internet allows humans to interact using a rich set of multimedia data such as texts, pictures, and videos. This position paper proposes to define a new research area called `connected multimedia', which is the study of a collection of research issues of the super-area social media that receive little attention in the literature. By connected multimedia, we mean the study of the social and technical interactions among users, multimedia data, and devices across cultures and explicitly exploiting the cultural differences.

The aim of this review is to present current state-of-the-art approach in the field of wearable system based cancer detection and identify key challenges that resist it from clinical adoption. A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45{\%} research articles and 55{\%} manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3{\%}), skin cancer (36.3{\%}), prostate cancer (18.1{\%}), and multi-type cancer (9{\%}). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system. It is well comprehended that upon sincere orientation of all identified challenges, wearable systems would emerge as vital alternative to futuristic cancer detection.",

Then we design IoT sensing framework for VNA, including cloud services and computation level scalability, inter-cloud architecture supporting telematics applications, and telematics application scenarios. After dissecting mobile cloud computing forming mechanism, we carry out the semantic modeling analysis for inter-cloud service model, and then design a VMS event processing flow to allow the management and cooperation among diverse components by means of event manager. The performance evaluation exemplified by VMS is implemented by means of probabilistic methods. The results show that convenience and efficiency increase in VNA as compared to existing schemes.",

Dissemination of information and advertising services to the targeted nodes is an important aspect in the performance of the future large scale network systems. With the contextual information inferred from available information, delivery of services can be performed in a more efficient way. Context-awareness is a key ingredient in any ubiquitous and pervasive system and provides intelligence to the system, allowing computing devices make appropriate and timely decisions on behalf of users. Semantic support for M2M communication can be enhanced if it leverages the available information and contextual data. In this paper we present a methodology for a context-aware publish-subscribe based approach to dissemination of information and services and a service selection method which is based on the idea of utilizing network information as services that is delivered via application programming interfaces. We propose a fuzzy MADM method and a context similarity measure. The proposed method of information dissemination is based on mining the value of a node based on information inferred from the contextual information of the node and contextually similar nodes. We take into account the quality of contextual information in aggregating contextual information from different sources.",

abstract="The emergence of cloud computing has made it become an attractive solution for large-scale data processing and storage applications. Cloud infrastructures provide users a remote access to powerful computing capacity, large storage space and high network bandwidth to deploy various applications. With the support of cloud computing, many large-scale applications have been migrated to cloud infrastructures instead of running on in-house local servers. Among these applications, continuous write applications (CWAs) such as online surveillance systems, can significantly benefit due to the flexibility and advantages of cloud computing. However, with specific characteristics such as continuous data writing and processing, and high level demand of data availability, cloud service providers prefer to use sophisticated models for provisioning resources to meet CWAs' demands while minimizing the operational cost of the infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel architecture of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs) or commonly referred to as Cloud-of-Clouds. Based on this architecture, we propose two operational cost-aware algorithms for provisioning cloud resources for CWAs, namely neighboring optimal resource provisioning algorithm and global optimal resource provisioning algorithm, in order to minimize the operational cost and thereby maximizing the revenue of CSPs. We validate the proposed algorithms through comprehensive simulations. The two proposed algorithms are compared against each other to assess their effectiveness, and with a commonly used and practically viable round-robin approach. The results demonstrate that NORPA and GORPA outperform the conventional round-robin algorithm by reducing the operational cost by up to 28 and 57 {\%}, respectively. The low complexity of the proposed cost-aware algorithms allows us to apply it to a realistic Cloud-of-Clouds environment in industry as well as academia.",

abstract="In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been introduced to offer promising solutions in many areas. A big challenge faced by the IoT is to integrate heterogeneous information sources and process information effectively. As an important element in information integration, temporal reasoning is highly related to the dynamic, sequential aspect of both the information integration and the decision making process. Focusing on temporal reasoning, this paper introduces a method to represent both qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints in a 2-dimensional (2-D) space. Meanwhile, an efficient constraint-based geometric (CG) algorithm for propagating constraints (including inherent constraints and constraint pairs) on events in a 2-D space is proposed. A geometric recombination and intersection (GRI) method, a part of the CG algorithm, is presented to propagate one constraint pair from a geometric point. The experimental results show that in terms of both constructed and realistic benchmarks, the CG algorithm outperforms the existing Floyd-Warshall's algorithm with the time complexity of O(n                        3), especially for benchmarks with a large number of events.",

abstract="Advancements in technology are radically transforming service, and increasingly providing the underlying basis for service strategy. In this paper, we develop a typology and positioning map for service strategy, in the context of rapid technological change, and outline the process for firms to position or reposition their service strategies. Which strategy to choose is based on the degree to which customer demand is heterogeneous, and the degree to which potential customer lifetime value varies across customers. This results in four strategies: the McService strategy that is standardized and transactional, the Relational Service strategy that is standardized and relational, the Customized Transaction strategy that is personalized and transactional, and the Adaptive Personalization strategy that is personalized and relational. We provide firms a roadmap for identifying a ``sweet spot'' strategy in relation to a segment's realized or potential customer lifetime value, combined with the firm's technological capabilities. Because technological capabilities inevitably advance, firms will tend to move from standardized to personalized and from transactional to relational over time, implying that firms should be alert to technological opportunities to personalize their relationships with customers. Our strategic framework also produces a useful bridge from marketing practice to the conceptual evolution of the service literature, showing how the historical trends toward continuing customer relationships and co-productive personalization should drive strategic thinking in service.",

Cryptographic standards and methods were left outside the scope of this review. Three broad classes of models are being actively investigated and developed: access control for electronic health records, access control for interoperability, and access control for risk analysis. Traditional role-based access control models are extended with spatial, temporal, probabilistic, dynamic, and semantic aspects to capture contextual information and provide granular access control. Maintenance of audit trails and facilities for overriding normal roles to allow full access in emergency cases are common features. Access privilege frameworks utilizing ontology-based knowledge representation for defining the rules have attracted considerable interest, due to the higher level of abstraction that makes it possible to model domain knowledge and validate access requests efficiently.",

In this work, we mainly address the problem of node connectivity analysis based on percolation theory. First, we investigate when it is possible for two nodes to communicate with each other. Based on the results from bond percolation in a two-dimensional lattice, as long as the probability is close less than 0.5 and each sub-square contains at least four nodes, percolation occurs. Then, the conditions for full connectivity in a network graph are established. How two adjacent sub-squares are connected differentiates this work from others. The full connectivity occurs almost surely if each sub-square contains at least one node and the probability of having an open sub-edge is no less than 0.3822. The proposed conditions for percolation and full connectivity are validated by simulations.",

We take these metrics and use case and systematically compare the two middleware platforms in the wild. We identify inefficiencies in implementations and characterize performance variations throughout the day, showing that the metrics may also be used for monitoring. Furthermore, we apply the same metrics and use case to two brokers set up in a controlled environment, providing infrastructure- and networking-independent insights.

Accordingly, this study reviews recent literature on HITs that employ RCTs, which are acknowledged as a reliable solution by the community of health stakeholders. Furthermore, it examines the research efforts in the field and evaluates the relevant functionalities. The literature search strategy was based on PRISMA 2009 Checklist and the CONSORT-EHEALTH Checklist that are two standard methodologies for systematic reviews in Evidence Based Medicine and Health Information Technologies. The analysis of the studies included was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The sources considered in this research include the most common clinical trial registries and academic electronic databases. The studies considered were conducted from 2008 until 2016. The authors considered RCTs having published their results in at least one article. As a result, 55 articles from 42 different journals are considered in this review. The benefits of the HIT delivered interventions are clearly presented in the outcomes of the relevant studies. Significant improvements were observed in the findings of 31 trials from a total of 51 (60.78{\%}) including the acceptance, satisfaction, reliability, usefulness, safety, effectiveness and financial benefit of HITs. The results of this review reveal that HIT and eHealth interventions achieve at least equally reliable and safe outcomes compared with the usual support methods of healthcare.

abstract="Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) are still in their early stage of development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios and applications is tremendous. That range is extended by its inclusion in Internet with IPv6 Low-Power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs). This makes it obvious that multi-technology topologies, security and mobility support will be prevalent in 6LoWPAN. Mobility based communication increases the connectivity, and allows extending and adapting LoWPANs to changes in their location and environment infrastructure. However, the required mobility is heavily dependent on the individual service scenario and the LoWPAN architecture. In this context, an optimized solution is proposed for critical applications, such as military, fire rescue or healthcare, where people need to frequently change their position. Our scenario is health monitoring in an oil refinery where many obstacles have been found to the effective use of LoWPANs in these scenarios, mainly due to transmission medium features i.e. high losses, high latency and low reliability. Therefore, it is very difficult to provide continuous health monitoring with such stringent requirements on mobility. In this paper, a paradigm is proposed for mobility over 6LoWPAN for critical environments. On the one hand the intra-mobility is supported by GinMAC, which is an extension of IEEE 802.15.4 to support a topology control algorithm, which offers intra-mobility transparently, and Movement Direction Determination (MDD) of the Mobile Node (MN). On the other hand, the inter-mobility is based on pre-set-up of the network parameters in the visited networks, such as Care of Address and channel, to reach a fast and smooth handoff. Pre-set-up is reached since MDD allows discovering the next 6LoWPAN network towards which MN is moving. The proposed approach has been simulated, prototyped, evaluated, and is being studied in a scenario of wearable physiological monitoring in hazardous industrial areas, specifically oil refineries, in the scope of the GinSeng European project.",

abstract="Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals often consist of unwanted noises and speckles. In order to remove the noises, various image processing filters are used in various studies. In this paper, FIR and IIR filters are initially used to remove the linear and nonlinear delay present in the input ECG signal. In addition, filters are used to remove unwanted frequency components from the input ECG signal. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the features present in the input ECG signal. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is widely used for pattern recognition. However, traditional SVM method does not applicable to compute different characteristics of the features of data sets. In this paper, we use SVM model with a weighted kernel function method to classify more features from the input ECG signal. SVM model with a weighted kernel function method is significantly identifies the Q wave, R wave and S wave in the input ECG signal to classify the heartbeat level such as Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) and Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs).

The calculated RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R2 and Q2 for the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is low when compared with other approaches such as LDA with MLP, and PCA with SVM and LDA with SVM.

abstract="In an attempt to develop an understanding of existing research trends and to inform the development of new research in the field of telecommunications, literature reviews are being conducted. As an effort for investigating research trend, our research suggests the application of a text mining analysis technique to identify the knowledge structures of academic research in the field of telecommunications policy and to pinpoint future research opportunities. In this study, three analytical techniques were employed: a productivity analysis; a contents analysis based on topic modeling and word co-occurrence; and an author co-citation analysis based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, multidimensional scaling, and a factor analysis. The findings from the research productivity analysis imply that the journal `Telecommunications Policy' has greatly contributed to the publication of studies related to telecommunications policy. Moreover, our research institution analysis results indicate that telecommunication policy studies are undertaken by experts in various research fields. The contents and citation analysis results demonstrate that many studies related to telecommunications policy cover infrastructure-related topics, including the design, arrangement, and distribution of telecommunications networks. By contrast, recent studies are found to focus on the privacy and digital divide issues that may arise in connection with the application of telecommunications networks to other information technologies or industrial areas. However, the area of policy research that focuses on the application of information technologies still concentrates on the methods for the application of existing services---such as broadcasting and multimedia---without paying sufficient attention to the policy issues that may arise from the application of cloud computing, the Internet of Things, or big data analytics, services that have emerged with the recent expansion of wireless communications networks. In this sense, there is a need for discussions about the policies to respond to the increasing use of radio frequencies owing to the expansion of the Internet of Things, and to promote the efficient and safe control of data transmitted in real time on the wireless Internet. Studies of new technologies in the telecommunications policy field should be carried out in view of local and national characteristics. At the same time, further studies should consider efficient and reasonable ways to export telecommunications and networking technologies to countries that seek to invest in or expand their telecommunications networks to new information technologies. Expanding on this research, more text mining techniques for analyzing large amounts of text data and for clustering and visualizing them need to be considered.",

The exposure of ICN to scenarios other than static content distribution is a growing research topic, promising to extend the impact of ICN to a broader scale. In this context, particular attention has been given to the application of ICN in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The current paper, by focusing on local domain IoT scenarios, such as multi-sensory Machine to Machine environments, discusses the challenges that ICN, particularly Interest-based solutions, impose to service discovery. This work proposes a service discovery mechanism for such scenarios, relying on an alternative forwarding pipeline for supporting its core operations.

abstract="IEEE standardized a highly efficient, low power, reliable, deterministic and time--frequency enabled medium access control protocol, IEEE 802.15.4e time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) as an amendment to the medium access control (MAC) protocol defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Once a communication schedule is built, the IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is able to execute such a communication schedule. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH standard lea ves out of scope defining how that communication schedule is built, updated and maintained. In order to fill this gap, we introduce such a scheduling algorithm, called as DIVA. DIVA is specifically designed for IEEE 8092.15.4e TSCH networks. It is a totally distributed scheduling algorithm for divergecast traffic where divergecast means that traffic flows in all directions in contrast to convergecast where traffic flows from leave nodes to root. In order to gain more comprehension about DIVA, we conducted extensive simulations. We also compared DIVA with Berkeley's Aloha-based algorithm.",

abstract="The wireless body sensor network (BSN) is used to detect and transmit physiological data such as vital signs by using radio wave communication. It offers a large saving potential for future healthcare applications because hospitalization of patients with chronic diseases can be kept at a minimum. The radio wave communication on the human body is impacted by the dielectric properties, the posture, and the movement of the body. Under these conditions a highly dynamic link-state and link quality are observed. In this paper we present a study of the link layer behavior of wireless BSNs operating at 2.45 GHz. We report on a wearable body-centric network operation in realistic environments from which we characterize the wireless channels based on a novel test framework. Our test framework uses a 200 ms time resolution for sampling of the wireless links between on-body sensor nodes. We record the received signal strength indicator and link quality indicator values as well as the packet delivery statistics in real-time. Based on recorded experiments we quantify the potential packet delivery performance and energy gain that can be obtained by using dynamic routing and adaptive transmission power schemes, respectively. Subsequently we formulate a set of requirements for the next revision of our prototype wireless BSN developed at Aarhus University School of Engineering in Denmark.",

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) (e.g. self-driving car) are currently being emerged as one of important places that heavily depend on spatial data in order to facilitate intelligent control and improve real-time on-line performance. To expedite and accelerate the realization of cyber-physical systems (hereinafter CPS) in spatial information science, this paper suggests embracing CPS as cross-platform to strengthen fusion-application value of spatial information. This approach illustrates how fusion-added services by spatial information within the CPS framework are created, orchestrated, changed and managed from traditional approach in spatial information science. It offers a sound approach to overcome the uncertainties associated with emerging technology as well as to adequately accommodate real-time operating CPS system in spatial information science. Further, such paradigm of symbolic cross-platform offer new and exciting challenges for foundational research between CPS and spatial information and provide opportunities for maturation of spatial information science in the fourth industrial revolution era.",

abstract="Academic research into RFID technology has largely neglected ethics. What scarce research was being performed has now dwindled despite having some consumers continue to express their ethical concerns. This article aims at reducing this apparent void by exploring the antecedents that cause the public to react when consumers are targeted by RFID technology. Through the analysis of 11 real RFID implementations used to target consumers, our research indicates that several factors can influence consumer response through the distinct nature of the technology, namely, (1) Customization of communications, (2) Imposition of tag use, (3) Segmentation and targeting, (4) Modified role of the sales representative, (5) Physical distance between the consumer and the tag, and (6) Security of transactions. The article then proposes a construct to determine the risk of raising consumer ethical concerns. The construct of ``Connective Proximity'' and its three components (physical proximity, exposure time, and information proximity) are defined. Our research highlights the need for further studies on the ethical considerations of tagging humans and specifically tracking consumers when performing marketing activities with RFID technology. Our article aims at invigorating research on this topic, which has a lot to contribute to both society and corporations.",

abstract="The Internet of Thing (IoT) is evolving into the Internet of Everything (IoE). Combining cloud computing with the IoE has attracted attention for wide area applications as a major service. In addition, low power wide area networks (LPWANs) have become a remarkable communication technology in IoT. Because the LPWAN provides long range communication with low power, it can be widely exploited for IoE applications. To improve quality of service, data traffic should be transmitted by considering its priority. However, this is not easy because the LPWAN has a low data rate and long transmission delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-channel medium access control (MAC) to satisfy these requirements in the LPWAN. Generated data is classified into three categories by considering traffic characteristics and is delivered with different priority in dual channels. The performance evaluation is carried out with computer simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in the LPWAN.",

Therefore, keeping in view the aforementioned needs, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that enhances the working of traditional MapReduce by incorporating parallel processing algorithm. Moreover, complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed parallel processing algorithm. The proposed system architecture both read and writes operations that enhance the efficiency of the Input/Output operation. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce. MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes to generate and process graphs with near real-time. Moreover, the system is evaluated in terms of efficiency by considering the system throughput and processing time. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient.",

abstract="In recent times, vehicular network research has attracted the attention of both researchers and the industry partly due to its potential applications in efficient traffic management, road safety, entertainment, etc. Resources such as communication, on-board unit, storage and computing units, and battery are generally installed in the vehicles participating in intelligent transportation systems. The need to maximize the utilization of these resources has also resulted in interest in cloud based vehicular networks (CVNs), an area of active research. This paper survey the CVNs literature published between 2010 and 2016. In addition, a taxonomy based on three main CVN categories, namely vehicular cloud computing (VCC), vehicle using cloud (VuC) and hybrid cloud (HC), is presented. In the taxonomy, we focus on related systems, architectures, applications and services. Although VCC has been extensively discussed in the literature, a comprehensive survey on the two other categories is lacking. Hence, this motivates our research. Through an extensive comparison of common characteristics among cloud computing, mobile cloud computing, VCC, VuC and HC and overview of the existing architectures, we present a conceptual HC architecture. Finally, we conclude the paper with open issues and challenges.",

abstract="Mobile crowd-sensing can learn the aggregate statistics over personal data to produce useful knowledge about the world. Since personal data may be privacy-sensitive, the aggregator should only gain desired statistics without learning anything about the personal data. To guarantee differential privacy of personal data under an untrusted aggregator, existing approaches encrypt the noisy personal data, and allow the aggregator to get a noisy sum. However, these approaches lack of either efficient support of dynamic joins and leaves, or secure data-integrity verification, or fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose a novel private data aggregation scheme to address these issues for mobile crowd-sensing applications. In our scheme, we first design an efficient group management protocol to deal with the participants' dynamic joins and leaves. Then we enhance the scheme with data-integrity verification by considering the security vulnerability of limited data range. Moreover, we guarantee fault tolerance by leveraging a future message buffering mechanism, enabling continuously obtaining aggregate results and integrity verifications when failures happen. The analysis indicates that our scheme achieves desired properties, and the performance evaluation demonstrates the scheme's efficiency in terms of communication and computation overhead.",

abstract="The huge amount of sensory data collected from mobile devices has offered great potentials to promote more significant services based on user data extracted from sensor readings. However, releasing user data could also seriously threaten user privacy. It is possible to directly collect sensitive information from released user data without user permissions. Furthermore, third party users can also infer sensitive information contained in released data in a latent manner by utilizing data mining techniques. In this paper, we formally define these two types of threats as inherent data privacy and latent data privacy and construct a data-sanitization strategy that can optimize the tradeoff between data utility and customized two types of privacy. The key novel idea lies that the developed strategy can combat against powerful third party users with broad knowledge about users and launching optimal inference attacks. We show that our strategy does not reduce the benefit brought by user data much, while sensitive information can still be protected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that preserves both inherent data privacy and latent data privacy.",

abstract="Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing--structure--property--performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.",

Of the 1911 identified studies, nine met the inclusion criteria of quantitative or mixed methods design, technology-enabled adherence and or retention intervention for US HIV-infected youth. The majority were small pilots. Intervention dose varied between studies applying similar technology platforms with more than half not informed by a theoretical framework. Retention in care was not a reported outcome, and operationalization of adherence was heterogeneous across studies. Despite these limitations, synthesized findings from this review demonstrate feasibility of computer-based interventions, and initial efficacy of SMS texting for adherence support among HIV-infected youth.

abstract="Pharmacovigilance, and generally applications of natural language processing models to healthcare, have attracted growing attention over the recent years. In particular, drug reactions can be extracted from user reviews posted on the Web, and automated processing of this information represents a novel and exciting approach to personalized medicine and wide-scale drug tests. In medical applications, demographic information regarding the authors of these reviews such as age and gender is of primary importance; however, existing studies usually either assume that this information is available or overlook the issue entirely. In this work, we propose and compare several approaches to automated mining of demographic information from user-generated texts. We compare modern natural language processing techniques, including extensions of topic models and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We apply single-task and multi-task learning approaches to this problem. Based on a real-world dataset mined from a health-related web site, we conclude that while CNNs perform best in terms of predicting demographic information by jointly learning different user attributes, topic models provide additional information and reflect gender-specific and age-specific symptom profiles that may be of interest for a researcher.",

abstract="Context-aware computing is the ability of Services and applications to adapt and react to context changes. Context modelling is a core feature of context-aware computing. Although a lot of research has been made in the field of context modelling, most of the context-aware computing proposals prefer to design their own customized context model instead of reusing an existing one. The main reason for this behaviour is that current context models present some problems concerning reusability, extensibility and adaptation. To contribute solving these issues, in this paper we present 3LConOnt, a three-level context ontology that can be easily reused, extended and adapted for specific or generic purposes. The proposed context model consolidates the context knowledge already available from a modular perspective yielding a clear schema of knowledge reutilization. To do so, we gathered context knowledge pieces from different ontologies to be integrated into standardized and well-defined levels of abstraction and modules. The proposal has been validated considering: (1) reusability, extensibility and adaptation by instantiating different smart scenarios; (2) consistency and reasoning by triggering queries to the proposed model based on some competence questions; and (3) reusability in existing ontologies by importing the needed module or level of the model. Additionally, we also illustrate its usability in context-aware Services by modelling a context-aware framework architecture for supporting the whole context life cycle: acquisition, modelling, reasoning and distribution.",

In fact, AAL aims at increasing the life quality of patients, their relatives and the health care providers with a holistic approach. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the AAL domain, presenting a systematic analysis of over 10 years of relevant literature focusing on the stakeholders' needs, bridging the gap of existing reviews which focused on technologies. The findings of this review clearly show that until now the AAL domain neglects the view of the entire AAL ecosystem. Furthermore, the proposed solutions seem to be tailored more on the basis of the available existing technologies, rather than supporting the various stakeholders' needs. Another major lack that this review is pointing out is a missing adequate evaluation of the various solutions. Finally, it seems that, as the domain of AAL is pretty new, it is still in its incubation phase. Thus, this review calls for moving the AAL domain to a more mature phase with respect to the research approaches.",

abstract="With decrease in the cost and the size of sensor devices, we can envision a world of ubiquitous sensor networks. Usually, sensor data needs to be disseminated from the source to data collectors, making the spatially distributed sensor data available for applications. The widespread and ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, e.g., PDAs and cell phones around the world, makes them attractive to be used as mobile data collectors (MDCs) to collect and deliver the sensor data. The goal of this work is to design a dissemination protocol that leads to efficient data delivery from the source sensors to ubiquitous MDCs. We propose the Wait-Focus-Spray (WFS) data delivery scheme for wireless sensor networks with ubiquitous MDCs. The main objective of WFS is to balance the data delivery latency and transmission overhead when considering the existence of ubiquitous MDCs. In WFS, we also propose a corresponding mechanism-probabilistic scattered binary spraying (PSBS), to reduce the spatial redundancy when spraying data copies, which can increase the probability of meeting a MDC. We then present an analytical model based on the Markov chain model to analyze the trade-off between delivery latency and transmission cost in WFS. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme reduces the transmission cost per message while provides comparable delivery delay compared with the alternative approach.",

This method allows for reducing image sizes without reducing the information content of the images in terms of detecting tumors. The proposed method involves first clarifying the brain tumor area using a modified K-means clustering method and initial segmentation using mean shift segmentation. Then a threshold setting is used to convert the gray scale image and remove noise by applying an erode operation. Finally, the brain tumors in the images are detected using a watershed algorithm. The proposed method was compared with two well-known methods namely the conventional K-mean clustering and Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering. We verified the precision and the objectivity of our proposed method. The average precision and recall for our proposed method were excellent with values of 0.914052 and 0.995641, respectively. Our method detected more brain tumors than the conventional K-means clustering and FCM clustering methods and was able to provide for an efficient image data processing with reduced file sizes.",

As we know, the most sophisticated sensory machine is a living organism. Formerly this thought led to the idea of creating a multisensory platform which would mimic the human skin capabilities. Electronic skin can simultaneously monitor many parameters such as temperature, strain, pressure, magnetic field, and intensity of light; it is also possible to emulate tactile and chemical perception. Nanotechnology serves as a tool for the creation of new sensor materials, and the development of printing technologies supports engineering low-cost, thin, lightweight, transparent, easily deformable, and biocompatible (even transient) electronic devices for monitoring external factors and processing information. In this review we discuss the state-of-the-art and prospects of new materials and technologies towards emerging flexible sensors.",

abstract="Alzheimer disease is a significant problem in public health. Alzheimer disease causes severe problems with thinking, memory and activities. Alzheimer disease affected more on the people who are in the age group of 80-year-90. The foot movement monitoring system is used to detect the early stage of Alzheimer disease. internets of things (IoT) devices are used in this paper to monitor the patients' foot movement in continuous manner. This paper uses dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to compare the various shapes of foot movements collected from the wearable IoT devices. The foot movements of the normal individuals and people who are affected by Alzheimer disease are compared with the help of middle level cross identification (MidCross) function. The identified cross levels are used to classify the gait signal for Alzheimer disease diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are calculated to evaluate the DTW algorithm based classification model for Alzheimer disease. The classification results generated using the DTW is compared with the various classification algorithms such as inertial navigation algorithm, K-nearest neighbor classifier and support vector machines. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the DTW method.",

The citizen engagement platform is the outcome of a 3-year Italian national project called PRISMA (Interoperable cloud platforms for smart government;                   http://www.ponsmartcities-prisma.it/                                  ). The aim of the project is to constitute a new model of digital ecosystem that can support and enable new methods of interaction among public administrations, citizens, companies, and other stakeholders surrounding cities. The platform has been defined by the media as a flexible (enable the addition of any kind of application or service) and open (enable access to open services) Italian ``cloud'' that allows public administrations to access to a vast knowledge base represented as linked open data to be reused by a stakeholder community with the aim of developing new applications (``Cloud Apps'') tailored to the specific needs of citizens. The platform has been used by Catania and Syracuse municipalities, two of the main cities of southern Italy, located in the Sicilian region. The fully adoption of the platform is rapidly spreading around the whole region (local developers have already used available application programming interfaces (APIs) to create additional services for citizens and administrations) to such an extent that other provinces of Sicily and Italy in general expressed their interest for its usage. The platform is available online and, as mentioned above, is open source and provides APIs for full exploitation.",

abstract="This article examines a medical biotechnology known as a wireless body area network (WBAN) as a way to discuss how electronic information infrastructure is spatially extending human bodies into physical landscapes. The term extensible body is introduced, framed by the object-oriented philosophy of Graham Harman. WBANs are sensors placed on or inside of the human body to measure, record, and transmit data about the biological processes of a medical patient. I argue that these body-data should be considered components of bodies themselves, not representations of them. Further, I argue that the geographical discourse on relationality should be less about object relations and more about object extensions. Harman's explication of the ``quadruple object,'' and specifically his use of real and sensual objects makes this possible. This questions the spatial beginnings and ends of categorical objects such as bodies and information, the implications of which could have profound impacts on how policies are framed in sectors such as public health, environment, planning, and medicine. The notion of extensibility is crucial in theorizing how, and where, the Geoweb exists as a spatial-technical assemblage of objects and information. The case of WBANs shows that a theorization of the Geoweb must include the built infrastructure of data storage as a spatial extension of being human.",

abstract="Due to the enhancing of life quality, increasing of chronic diseases, changing lifestyles, and an expanding life expectancy, rapid population aging requires a new business model that promotes happiness and emphasizes a healthy body and mind through the ``anytime, anywhere well-being'' lifestyle. Recently, lifecare systems using IoT devices are being released as products that are influential on the overall society, and their effectiveness is continuously proven. In addition, based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, diverse companies are conducting investments and research to develop devices as well as solutions that connect to these devices. Accordingly, in this study, a mining-based lifecare-recommendation method using a peer-to-peer dataset and adaptive decision feedback is proposed. In addition to collecting PHRs, the proposed method measures life-logs such as dietary life, life pattern, sleep pattern, life behavior, and job career; the P2P-dataset preprocessed index information; and biometric information using a wearable device. It uses the Open API to collect the health-weather and life-weather index data from public data, and it uses a smart-band-type wearable device known as a biosensor to measure the heart rate, daily activity, and body temperature. It monitors the current status and conditions through the classification of life data, and it mines big data and uses a decision tree to analyze the association rules and correlations, as well as to discover new knowledge patterns. In the peer-to-peer networking, a lifecare recommendation model that uses adaptive decision feedback has been developed for the peer-to-peer platform. This adaptive decision feedback reflects an individual's importance or sensory level. Accordingly, it proposes more individualized and flexible results and can be configured to support intellectual lifecare. A mining-based lifecare-recommendation mobile service can also be developed to enhance the quality of life, as it provides user-based health management and reduces the medical expenses; accordingly, it enhances the service satisfaction and quality in the lifecare field.",

A Facebook application was created to collect data concerning adherence to the Mediterranean diet, considering the significant risk of cardiovascular and neurological degenerative diseases in subjects with poor adherence to a healthy diet. More than 1400 users were recruited in a short time without any promotional action. Collected data indicate that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is in general greater in older users vs young (,

abstract="With the advancement of communication technologies, the number of devices connected to the internet is increasing exponentially day by day. Multiple IoT applications have been evolved since recent past. Low power consumption, accuracy of transmission and robustness takes the center stage in developing these applications. IEEE 802.15.4 is a low power protocol for low range low data rate scenario. In this paper, we propose a minimal error modified IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver for IoT applications in health care. The health-care scenario, due to its critical nature, calls for an error free communication. We propose a modified frequency offset estimator which performs better in terms of error variance than the existing estimators for IEEE 802.15.4. The simulation result shows that the bit error rate and packet error rate performance of the proposed transceiver are significantly improved compared to the standard architecture. The proposed transceiver reduces the power consumption due to less number of retransmission per packet for successful transmission of the packet.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen rapidly advancing as it is emerging as next technology revolution. IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) plays a main communication interface in IoT since it is able to bridge the lightweight underlying IEEE 802.15.4 protocols and IPv6. Proxy MIPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based localized mobility management which ideal for 6LoWPAN network because the mobile node in the PMIPv6 domain is not involved with IP mobility signalling. However, PMIPv6 is restricted to communicate in single hop network. It is impractical for 6LoWPAN network which is composed of low-power sensor nodes that have limited transmission power. In this paper, a new mobility support mechanism named the Sensor Prefix-Mapping Scheme (SP-MS) is proposed in the context of providing efficient node mobility support. The experiment is carried out by deploying two constrained 6LoWPAN networks with Contiki Operating System and a PMIPv6 backhaul network with OpenAirInterface Proxy Mobile IPv6. The results proved the efficiency of proposed SP-MS; the 0.79 {\%} round-trip delay increment with increasing number of hops when all nodes are sending packets simultaneously is considered insignificant. Besides, the handoff components are optimized to outperform the previous MIPv6 implementation (Roth et al. in Proceedings of the 9th ACM symposium on performance evaluation of wireless ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks, pp. 77--84, 2012) in term of inter-network handoff delay in one hop scenario. These findings suggest the efficiency of proposed SP-MS to support node mobility between multi-hop 6LoWPAN networks based on PMIPv6.",

abstract="Information systems are very crucial in today's organizations, and hence the selection of the right system has become a very critical decision. As time has progressed, with new issues affecting the supply chain and the performance metrics being continually rewritten, the responsibility of the information systems has increased manifold. Nowadays, information systems are expected to perform a number of functions such as information security, big data handling, green supply chain and risk management and thus the basic problem of system selection is now more complex. Also, adding to the complexity is the fact that these new issues are interdependent and most of the times influence other issues in a variety of direct or indirect ways. This study addresses this problem by proposing a new model for information system selection by incorporating the latest trends in the supply chain. It also proposes an integrated methodology, to solve such a problem where interdependence between criteria exists. The advantages of this methodology over other existing techniques are delinking the evaluation of interdependent criteria weights from performance evaluation, flexibility of inputs, ability to handle vagueness and uncertainty in judgements. The methodology is illustrated using a numerical example.",

DPHK predicts and sends predicted data at one time instead of sending the triggered data of these sensor nodes which people is going to pass in several times. Firstly, our system learns the knowledge of transition probability among sensor nodes from the historical binary motion data through data mining. Secondly, it stores the corresponding knowledge in each sensor node based on a special storage mechanism. Thirdly, each sensor node applies HMM (hidden Markov model) algorithm to predict the sensor node locations people will arrive at according to the receivedmessage. At last, these sensor nodes send their triggered data and the predicted data to the sink node. The significances of DPHK are as follows: (a) the procedure of DPHK is distributed; (b) it effectively reduces the connection between sensor nodes and sink node. The time complexities of the proposed algorithms are analyzed and the performance is evaluated by some designed experiments in a smart environment.",

abstract="Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an important technique used for automatic identification and data capture. In recent years, low-cost RFID tags have been used in many open-loop applications beyond supply chain management, such as the tagging of the medicine, clothes, and belongings after the point of sales. At the same time, with the development of semiconductor industry, handheld terminals and mobile phones are becoming RFID-enabled. Unauthorized mobile RFID readers could be abused by the malicious hackers or curious common people. Even for authorized RFID readers, the ownership of the reader can be transferred and the owners of the authorized mobile reader may not be always reliable. The authorization and authentication of the mobile RFID readers need to take stronger security measures to address the privacy or security issues that may arise in the emerging open-loop applications. In this paper, the security demands of RFID tags in emerging open-loop applications are summarized, and two example protocols for authorization, authentication and key establishment based on symmetric cryptography are presented. The proposed protocols adopt a timed-session-based authorization scheme, and all reader-to-tag operations are authorized by a trusted third party using a newly defined class of timed sessions. The output of the tags is randomized to prevent unauthorized tracking of the RFID tags. An instance of the protocol A is implemented in 0.13-$\mu$m CMOS technology, and the functions are verified by field programmable gate array. The baseband consumes 44.0 $\mu$W under 1.08 V voltage and 1.92 MHz frequency, and it has 25,067 gate equivalents. The proposed protocols can successfully resist most security threats toward open-loop RFID systems except physical attacks. The timing and scalability of the two protocols are discussed in detail.",

abstract="A great number of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) based applications, which are telecommunication areas with the highest foreseen growth in the future years, require energy efficient, long range and low data rate wireless communication links. In order to offer a competitive solution in these areas, IEEE 802.11 standardization group has defined the ``ah'' amendment, the first sub-1 GHz WLAN standard, with flexible channel bandwidths, starting from 1 MHz, up to 16 MHz, and many other physical and link layer improvements, enabling long-range and energy efficient communications. However, for some regions, like Europe, the maximum transmitted power in dedicated frequency band is limited to only 10 mW, thus disabling the achievement of ranges which would be close to targeted of up to 1 km. In this paper we examine possibilities for range extension through implementation of half-duplex decode-and forward (DF) relay station (RS) in communication between an access point (AP) and an end-station (ST). Assuming a Rician fading channel between AP and RS, and a Rayleigh fading channel on RS--ST link, we analytically derive results on achievable ranges for the most robust modulation and coding schemes (MCSs), both on downlink (DL) and uplink (UL). Analyses are performed for two different standard adopted deployment scenarios on RS--ST link, and variable end-to-end link outage probabilities. Moreover, we have analyzed whether the considered most robust MCSs, known for supporting the longest range, but the lowest data rates, can meet the defined requirement of at least 100 kb/s for the greatest attainable AP--RS--ST distances. We examine data rate enhancements, brought by coding and using of short packets, for both DL and UL. Finally, we present bit error rate results, obtained through simulations, of a dual-hop DF IEEE 802.11ah relay system for the considered MCs. All presented results confirm that IEEE 802.11ah systems through deployment of relay stations, become an interesting solution for M2M and IoT based applications, due to flexibility they offer in many aspects, meeting requirements for wide transmission ranges in such applications.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) becomes an inevitable technology for ICT convergence. It gathers information from various objects and provides intelligent services through analyzing the information. To collect surrounding information, IoT employs a sensor network, which is a low-power wireless communication network with numerous sensor nodes. Sensor nodes in conventional sensor networks have short transmission range. However, it is required a sensor network with long transmission range as well as low transmission power consumption for various IoT services. Long transmission range of IoT devices affects transmission environment. Lots of sensor nodes (i.e., IoT devices) in the long range sensor network transmit data to a given gateway node in order to deliver data to a network server. The gateway node can experience serious traffic load to relay the data. It causes to drop transmission efficiency. Therefore, for efficient data transmission, a network architecture and a data transmission method for long range IoT services are necessary. This paper proposes the network and data transmission architecture for the long range sensor networks. The proposed network architecture is based on oneM2M IoT standard. It has Infrastructure Node (IN), Middle Node (MN) and Application Service Node (ASN) as network elements. In the proposed method, IN employs cloned MNs to reduce the traffic load at the MN, which is the gateway. ASN delivers data through MN or cloned MNs to the IN. Through the load balancing by the proposed method at the MN, the efficient data transmission for IoT services in long range sensor networks can be provided. The performance of the proposed method is validated by the computer simulation.",

The conceptual framework is structured along three layers - physical, inference and user -- and is based on an information space of events, conditions and actions, linked together in Event-Condition-Action rules and operating according to the interconnection metaphor. The results of the user study have provided some indications for the implementation of the user layer, suggesting which could be the most suitable interaction style for rule design by a community of end users (e.g. a family) and which issues should be addressed in such a wide context.",

The conductive polymer was made by mixing silver fibers into uncured PDMS matrix. The prepared mixture was micromolded by three dimension (3D) printed master using soft lithography technique. Serpentine and spiral like microstructures were embedded on the nonconductive layer of PDMS. The SEM images show uniform dispersion of silver fibers in the composites.

abstract="In this paper, we proposed an secure IoT framework to ensure an End-To-End security from an IoT application to IoT devices. The proposed IoT framework consists of the IoT application, an IoT broker and the IoT devices. The IoT devices can be deployed along a board line or a boundary of the area of IoT broker. The IoT broker manages their own devices and aggregates their sensing data. The IoT application provides users with IoT services. To use the IoT services, it needs to access to sensing data. Especially, the case of real-time healthcare services should consider intermediate security issues because medical information of patients is one of very sensitive privacy information. However, most of IoT protocols such as CoAP and MQTT have no concern about the End-To-End security, they only depended on the security of DTLS. Therefore, we proposed a new IoT framework to satisfy the End-To-End security feature under the CoAP communication. The proposed framework encrypts sensitive data by a symmetric encryption and an attribute-based encryption for efficiencies of communication and computation costs. In addition, each IoT device has a unique identification used as one of their attributes. Consequently, although the IoT broker is one of the intermediate nodes, it decrypts and shows data only if it satisfies all attributes.",

year="2017",
month="Nov",

abstract="In the big data era, the volume of streaming data produced by sensor networks is staggeringly large that enables business intelligence to make well-informed decisions on emerging modern applications. Performing the data analytics and query processing over the fast arriving data streams is a tedious process. The semantic annotation of the data stream provides a high-level description, and a semantic context supports intelligent querying and data analytics. This paper presents a framework called SEmantic Annotation over Summarized sensOr Data stReam (SEASOR) that includes summarization, semantic annotation, and query processing that facilitates sensor data stream analytics. The summarization merges these types of stream values to increase the query performance and decrease the memory space. The semantic annotation is scripted with the help of application-dependent base ontology that extends the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology. The annotation of the sensor stream provides detailed descriptions for the observation of sensors using the base ontology, and it divides the streaming sensor data into several subsets according to the sensing features. The domain model enables the query processor to access the relevant results via an annotated Resource Description Framework (RDF). The query processor uses the extended SPARQL (Cs-SPARQL) to access only the relatively small subset via an annotated RDF file and allows extending the query processing to support windows and the parallel processing of data streams. The experimental results prove that the proposed SEASOR provides timely answers to the user queries and achieves better performance in terms of result accuracy by 95{\%}.",

In order to realize it, the handoff related control messages are designed to transmit in link layer, and resolution for ping-pong handoff is also given. Simulation results show the novel scheme efficiently reduces the amount of handoff messages, which is benefit for energy saving of WSN.

abstract="In the Internet of Things (IoT), data-producing entities sense their environment and transmit these observations to a data processing platform for further analysis. Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making. To show the strengths of the platform, two use cases are detailed and thoroughly evaluated.",

abstract="Advanced sensing and internet of things bring the big data, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for data-driven knowledge discovery. However, it is common that a large number of variables (or predictors, features) are involved in the big data. Complex interdependence structures among variables pose significant challenges on the traditional framework of predictive modeling. This paper presents a new methodology of self-organizing network to characterize the interrelationships among variables and cluster them into homogeneous subgroups for predictive modeling. Specifically, we develop a new approach, namely nonlinear coupling analysis to measure variable-to-variable interdependence structures. Further, each variable is represented as a node in the complex network. Nonlinear-coupling forces move these nodes to derive a self-organizing topology of the network. As such, variables are clustered into sub-network communities. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms traditional variable clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and oblique principal component analysis, but also effectively identifies interdependent structures among variables and further improves the performance of predictive modeling. Additionally, real-world case study shows that the proposed method yields an average sensitivity of 96.80{\%} and an average specificity of 92.62{\%} in the identification of myocardial infarctions using sparse parameters of vectorcardiogram representation models. The proposed new idea of self-organizing network is generally applicable for predictive modeling in many disciplines that involve a large number of highly-redundant variables.",

Part of these strategies is to develop new types of innovation approaches in urban areas, which are characterized, firstly, by a high level of citizen involvement in co-creating Internet-based applications in all sectors of the economy and society; secondly, by the emergence of new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutes, universities, and companies. Such strategies and the resulting ``innovation ecosystems'' are becoming increasingly relevant given the growing economic and social issues and opportunities that cities are currently facing. This special issue investigates these smart city strategies through four smart city case studies and two papers addressing horizontal issues. The case studies aim to analyze the currently emerging strategies and policies related to identify how the opportunities of the Future Internet are being used for the socio-economic development of urban areas. The four cases also address how cities are redefining their innovation structures and how they started to experiment citizens involvement within the context of open innovation, and present lessons learned that are of interest to smart city stakeholders.",

The system stores the required contexts in knowledge ontology, including the physiological information and environmental information of the person under care, as the database of decision. The motion-sensing device enables the person under care to interact with the system through gestures. By the inference mechanism of fuzzy theory, the system can offer advice and rapidly execute service, thus, implementing the EHA. In addition, the system is integrated with the functions of smart phone, tablet PC, and PC, in order that users can implement remote operation and share information regarding the person under care. The health care system constructed in this study enables the decision making system to probe into the health risk of each person under care; then, from the view of preventive medicine, and through a composing system and simulation experimentation, tracks the physiological trend of the person under care, and provides early warning service, thus, promoting smart home care.",

abstract="Nanotechnology is a new and very promising area of research which will allow several new applications to be created in different fields, such as, biological, medical, environmental, military, agricultural, industrial and consumer goods. This paper focuses specifically on nanocommunications, which will allow interconnected devices, at the nano-scale, to achieve collaborative tasks, greatly changing the paradigm in the fields described. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm which allows nanomachines to exchange information using molecules as carrier. This is the most promising nanocommunication method within nanonetworks, since it can use bio-inspired techniques, inherit from studied biological systems, which makes the connection of biologic and man-made systems a easier process. At this point, the biggest challenges in these type of nanocommunication are to establish feasible and reliable techniques that will allow information to be encoded, and mechanisms that ensure a molecular communication between different nodes. This paper focus on creating concepts and techniques to tackle these challenges, and establishing new foundations on which future work can be developed. The created concepts and techniques are then applied in an envisioned medical application, which is based on a molecular nanonetwork deployed inside the Human body. The goal of this medical application is to automatously monitor endocrine diseases using the benefits of nanonetworks, which in turn connects with the internet, thus creating a Internet of NanoThings system. The concepts and techniques developed are evaluated by performing several simulations and comparing with other researches, and the results and discussions are presented on the later sections of this paper.",

While traceability is a critical aspect of majority of RFID applications, realizing traceability for these applications brings many fundamental research and development issues. In this paper, we assess the requirements for developing traceability applications that use networked RFID technology at their core.

abstract="Distributed information infrastructures are increasingly used in the geospatial domain. In the infrastructures, data are being collected by distributed sensor services, served by distributed geospatial data services, transformed by processing services and workflows, and consumed by smart clients. Consequently, Geographical Information Systems (GISs) are moving from GISystems to GIServices. Intelligent GIServices are enriched with new capabilities including knowledge representation, semantic reasoning, automatic workflow composition, and quality and traceability. Such Intelligent GIServices facilitate information discovery and integration over the network and automate the assembly of GIServices to provide value-added products. This paper provides an overview of intelligent GIServices. The concept of intelligent GIServices is described, followed by a review of the state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies relevant to intelligent GIServices. Visions on how GIServices can perceive, reason, learn, and act intelligently are highlighted.

abstract="In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT), which aims to achieve ubiquitous communication among a large number of resource constraint embedded devices, has emerged as a new paradigm in the field of wireless communications. Enabling the IoT essentially requires thousands of low-power and low cost embedded devices to be efficiently and seamlessly interconnected. Consequently, routing protocols play a crucial role in providing the interoperability for IoT components. In order to turn IoT into reality, IETF has standardized the IPv6 Routing Protocols for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). As the pervasiveness of RPL increases, a comprehensive survey of RPL is crucial to pave the way for researchers to understand and contribute in the relevant research area of RPL. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive study of RPL protocol as well as its latest and standardized addition, i.e., point-to-point RPL (P2P-RPL). Specifically, this paper focuses on performance evaluations, research challenges and envisioned opportunities of RPL. In addition, we also introduce a NS-3 framework design of RPL and P2P-RPL protocols. Furthermore, extensive simulation studies are conducted across various scenarios to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of RPL and P2P-RPL protocols. Moreover, research gaps and challenges facing in RPL and P2P-RPL protocols are also addressed. Finally, we summarize the paper by providing valuable insights of enabling technologies and suggestions for future research.",

This paper reviews the literature on `Big Data and supply chain management (SCM)', dating back to 2006 and provides a thorough insight into the field by using the techniques of bibliometric and network analyses. We evaluate 286 articles published in the past 10 years and identify the top contributing authors, countries and key research topics. Furthermore, we obtain and compare the most influential works based on citations and PageRank. Finally, we identify and propose six research clusters in which scholars could be encouraged to expand Big Data research in SCM. We contribute to the literature on Big Data by discussing the challenges of current research, but more importantly, by identifying and proposing these six research clusters and future research directions.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call `data for life', wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.",

abstract="In the past few years, various lightweight cryptographic algorithms have been proposed to balance the trade-offs between the requirements of resource constrained IoT devices and the need to securely transmit and protect data. However, it is critical to analyze and evaluate these algorithms to examine their capabilities. This paper provides a thorough investigation of the randomness of ciphertext obtained from Simeck, Kasumi, DES and AES. The design of our randomness analysis is based on five metrics implemented following the guidance of the NIST statistical test suite for cryptographic applications. This analysis also provides performance and power consumption evaluations for the selected cryptographic algorithms using different platforms and measures. Results from the evaluation reveal that lightweight algorithms have competitive randomness levels, lower processing time and lower power consumption when compared to conventional algorithms.",

abstract="Since heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to evaluate the physiological status of the human body, devices specifically designed for such applications are needed. To this end, we developed a smart electrocardiography (ECG) patch. The smart patch measures ECG using three electrodes integrated into the patch, filters the measured signals to minimize noise, performs analog-to-digital conversion, and detects R-peaks. The measured raw ECG data and the interval between the detected R-peaks can be recorded to enable long-term HRV analysis. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the built-in R-wave detection, robustness of the device under motion, and applicability to the evaluation of mental stress. The R-peak detection results obtained with the device exhibited a sensitivity of 99.29{\%}, a positive predictive value of 100.00{\%}, and an error of 0.71{\%}. The device also exhibited less motional noise than conventional ECG recording, being stable up to a walking speed of 5 km/h. When applied to mental stress analysis, the device evaluated the variation in HRV parameters in the same way as a normal ECG, with very little difference. This device can help users better understand their state of health and provide physicians with more reliable data for objective diagnosis.",

abstract="Cryptographic algorithms rely on the strengths of all their fundamental components and expect them to be harmonious in accomplishing desired levels of security in applications. In order for a security solution to be sophisticated and to provide high security (measured in terms of the security goals it satisfies), the solution needs to typically involve complex mathematical operations and/or multiple stages of operation. While these might offer increased security, such solutions might not be applicable to all systems. We refer to resource-constrained wireless networks, such as radio frequency identification and wireless body area networks, where the resources available on-chip are often decided by the balance between device costs, requirements of longevity and usability. The constraints, thus, require designing solutions that use simple logical operations and are based on reuse of functions, while introducing sufficient unpredictability to increase security. In this paper, we present a key management and message signature generation scheme called HiveSec, whose design is inspired by the symmetry in beehives and the nature of bee swarms, and which offers security through unpredictability and reduced resource usage. We validate our work through simulation studies and security analysis.",

abstract="Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application's interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

abstract="The IoT domain is characterized by many applications that require low-bandwidth communications over a long range, at a low cost and at low power. Low power wide area networks (LPWANs) fulfill these requirements by using sub-GHz radio frequencies (typically 433 or 868 MHz) with typical transmission ranges in the order of 1 up to 50 km. As a result, a single base station can cover large areas and can support high numbers of connected devices (>1000 per base station). Notorious initiatives in this domain are LoRa, Sigfox and the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah (or ``HaLow'') standard. Although these new technologies have the potential to significantly impact many IoT deployments, the current market is very fragmented and many challenges exists related to deployment, scalability, management and coexistence aspects, making adoption of these technologies difficult for many companies. To remedy this, this paper proposes a conceptual framework to improve the performance of LPWAN networks through in-network optimization, cross-technology coexistence and cooperation and virtualization of management functions. In addition, the paper gives an overview of state of the art solutions and identifies open challenges for each of these aspects.",

Future wireless networks must address exponential growth in connectivity, capacity and services, while perpetuating energy and cost reductions. It is therefore, crucial to intelligently evaluate key contenders of 5G evolution. This article provides an overview of ten fundamental concepts that could impact 5G framework. An outline of expected benefits is deliberated in this paper. We discuss compelling need of a new spectrum followed by associated changes in terms of air interface, architecture and MAC layer protocols. For alleviating access complexity in diverse-dense 5G deployment, we make a review on Heterogeneous-Cloud Radio Access Networks and Software Defined Networking. We also discuss two disruptive approaches with high research challenges, non orthogonality and full duplex.",

Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are being billed as the replacement for barcoding, the all-pervasive technology which has underpinned supply chains for the past 35 years. The standards allow for up to thirty trillion, trillion, trillion unique addresses, and the ultimate goal is to create an `Internet of things' in which everyday physical items are networked together. Concerted research effort over the past five years has developed the technology and reduced cost to a point where deployment is now possible. However, the recent heated debate centred on spy chips has highlighted the fact that one person's `ubiquitous computing' is another person's `Big Brother state'.",

abstract="Advances in human-centric technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), application-oriented sensing and smart home, along with recent developments in internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) networks are enabling the design and development of a smarter home with cognitive intelligence. In this paper, we first investigate the integration of smart home and botanical IoT for creating a better living environment to increase people's quality of life. First, we point out that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment, while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the affective interaction between greeneries and home users. It is foreseeable that the emotion-aware capability of smart home 2.0 will bring more intelligent and interactive healthcare applications for urban residents in the future.",

Along with the sensing capability for ubiquitous events, IoT Technology provides means to deliver services in time sensitive and information intensive manner. In this paper, a framework for IoT based activity monitoring of defence personnel is presented to detect the precursors of suspiciousness in terms of information outflow that can compromise the national security. Though maintaining intellectual defence personnel remained a major area of concern for every nation, still investigating reports of recent terrorist attacks in different countries have discovered the number of suspicion factors from their daily activities. The work presented in this study focuses on these factors in terms of efficient monitoring of social activities and analyzing it over suspicious scale. Moreover, Suspicious Index (SI) is defined for every personnel on the basis of their activities that can compromise national security directly or indirectly. Furthermore, automated game theoretic decision making model is presented to aid the monitoring officials in suppressing the probability of information outflow. In order to validate the system, two types of evaluations are performed. In one case, an imitative environment is considered to monitor 10 college students' daily engagements for 7 days. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques of data assessment. In the second case, a mathematical evaluation for the game theoretic decision making is performed. Results in both cases show that the proposed model achieves better performance in efficient monitoring of suspicious activities and effective decision making.",

abstract="In this research, we propose virtual caregiver (VCareGiver), a virtual caregiver as a cyber-physical smart home (CPSH) companion to support the daily life activities of elderly people through their gestures. The CPSH will act as a virtual caregiver who will understand the need of an elderly person and be present with him/her ubiquitously at any time and at any location within his/her house. VCareGiver will help in solving two important problems. Firstly, a large population is at their old age who needs help in their daily chores, since the family members are unable to give full support (e.g. reminding the to-do list, maintaining appointments, taking medicine on right time, sending SMS, saving energy due to consumption of electricity, controlling home appliances, etc.) due to busy schedule. Secondly, due to the old age movement problem, they need support in doing activities through gesture. In this research, we want to test the viability of the virtual caregiver as a physical assistant. The gestures of an elderly subject in the physical world are recognized by a multi-sensory IoT-based framework that is passed to the CPSH, which analyses the gestures and generates a command to perform certain physical world activity and finally produce the visualization. A proof of concept CPSH has been implemented through the web, and smartphone based applications. More than 100 different gestures have been incorporated into the CPSH system through which different daily life activities can be performed. Initial test results are very encouraging and show the prospect of such virtual caregiver, which can revolutionize the quality of life of our prospective elderly generation.",

In the past four decades, the fabless model (which allows a semiconductor firm to operate without a fabrication unit) has changed the global semiconductor industry with significant impact in the Asian regions. In this paper, we trace the origin and evolution of the fabless model through a mixed-method approach, utilizing historic milestones, events, and financial data of publicly-traded semiconductor firms. We have applied theories of institutional entrepreneurship and adaptive ecosystem to identify four stages in this history: differentiation, mobilization, legitimization, and symbiosis to conceptualize the fabless model's co-creation and co-evolution. Our findings indicate that actions of institutional entrepreneurs within specific temporal locations and structures played a crucial role in the fabless business model's origin and co-evolution.",

abstract="Falls are reported to be the leading causes of accidental deaths among elderly people. Automatic detection of falls from video sequences is an assistant technology for low-cost health care systems. In this paper, we present a novel slow feature analysis based framework for fall detection in a house care environment. Firstly, a foreground human body is extracted by a background subtraction technique. After morphological operations, the human silhouette is refined and covered by a fitted ellipse. Secondly, six shape features are quantified from the covered silhouette to represent different human postures. With the help of the learned slow feature functions, the shape feature sequences are transformed into slow feature sequences with discriminative information about human actions. To represent the fall incidents, the squared first order temporal derivatives of the slow features are accumulated into a classification vector. Lastly, falls are distinguished from other daily actions, such as walking, crouching, and sitting, by the trained directed acyclic graph support vector machine. Experiments on the multiple-camera fall dataset and the SDUFall dataset demonstrate that our method is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving 94.00{\%} recognition rate on the former dataset and 96.57{\%} on the latter one.",

abstract="As a significant part of the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has attract much attention in this years. In WBANs, sensors placed in or around the human body collect the sensitive data of the body and transmit it through an open wireless channel in which the messages may be intercepted, modified, etc. Recently, Wang et al. presented a new anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs and claimed that their scheme can solve the security problems in the previous schemes. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that their scheme cannot withstand impersonation attack. Either an adversary or a malicious legal client could impersonate another legal client to the application provider. In this paper, we give the detailed weakness analysis of Wang et al.'s scheme at first. Then we present a novel anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs and prove that it's secure under a random oracle model. At last, we demonstrate that our presented anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs is more suitable for practical application than Wang et al.'s scheme due to better security and performance. Compared with Wang et al.'s scheme, the computation cost of our scheme in WBANs has reduced by about 31.58 {\%}.",

abstract="Data collection is one of the fundamental functions in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Different from a typical WSN with only a single and stationary sink, this paper considers a scenario with multiple mobile sinks. The motivation is for a WSN to support future applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT). In this case, a WSN requires abilities to deliver sensing results to multiple users roaming in the network. There are two difficulties in this problem: sink mobility and multiple sinks. Since sinks are mobile, data delivery paths need to be updated frequently, which causes huge maintenance cost. To resolve this problem, we propose a hop-count-based architecture together with an efficient mobility management scheme. On the other side, sensing results from a large number of sensors are delivered to multiple sinks, which causes lots of packet transmissions. To reduce transmission cost, the concepts of multicast and data aggregation are integrated and applied. We first prove that a distributed multicast decision is a NP-hard problem and then propose a heuristic solution. Afterward, we further merge data aggregation into multicast and propose a distributed many-to-many aggregation scheme. Simulations are constructed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. The results show that both the proposed multicast scheme and many-to-many aggregation scheme can efficiently reduce transmission cost and energy when delivering data to multiple mobile sinks.",

The system consists of a combination of Internet-enabled stationary and mobile WSAN nodes, which resembles an Internet of Things scenario. A distributed warehouse monitoring and control scenario with collaborating stationary and mobile WSAN nodes is used as a motivating example designed and implemented in SystemJ. This example demonstrates the capabilities of SystemJ for designing distributed AmI systems with inherent support for reactivity and composition of concurrent behaviors based on a formal model of computation, without the need for any additional middleware. The approach is compared with existing software agent, robotic and WSAN middleware approaches in designing the same type of systems.",

abstract="Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is the most convenient, cost-effective, accurate, and non-invasive technology for e-health monitoring. The performance of WBAN may be disturbed when coexisting with other wireless networks. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive study and in-depth analysis of coexistence issues and interference mitigation solutions in WBAN technologies. A thorough survey of state-of-the art research in WBAN coexistence issues is conducted. The survey classified, discussed, and compared the studies according to the parameters used to analyze the coexistence problem. Solutions suggested by the studies are then classified according to the followed techniques and concomitant shortcomings are identified. Moreover, the coexistence problem in WBAN technologies is mathematically analyzed and formulas are derived for the probability of successful channel access for different wireless technologies with the coexistence of an interfering network. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted using OPNET with several real-life scenarios to evaluate the impact of coexistence interference on different WBAN technologies. In particular, three main WBAN wireless technologies are considered: IEEE 802.15.6, IEEE 802.15.4, and low-power WiFi. The mathematical analysis and the simulation results are discussed and the impact of interfering network on the different wireless technologies is compared and analyzed. The results show that an interfering network (e.g., standard WiFi) has an impact on the performance of WBAN and may disrupt its operation. In addition, using low-power WiFi for WBANs is investigated and proved to be a feasible option compared to other wireless technologies.",

The contents of this paper are exemplary of what can be achieved though the interaction of students, staff, faculty and, in one example, high school teachers. While the projects completed within the groups involved in this paper have spanned other areas, the focus of this paper is on the biomedical devices, that is, towards improving and maintaining health in a variety of areas. The spirit of the translational research is discovery, invention, intellectual property protection, and the creation of value through the spinning off of companies while providing better health care and creating jobs. All but one of these projects involve wireless radio frequency (RF) energy for delivery. The remaining device can be wirelessly connected for data collection.",

abstract="There is a global trend of the shortage of nature resources, such as water and wildlife, which have suffered dramatic losses due to over-use, pollution, habitat loss, and, increasingly, changes caused by global warming. To make the planet more sustainable, abundant data has to be collected and analyzed from ecosystems for scientific decision-making, restoring and preserving natural resources. In this paper, an integrated systems approach has been proposed for the data acquisition and analysis in information management of an ecosystem; it is a direct extension of an agriculture ecosystem enterprise information system (AEEIS) developed by Xu et al. (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 3:5--17, 2008). The challenges in system development have been discussed, and the significance of the developed system has been illustrated through a thorough discussion and a case study on the genetic coding and expression of antelopes. In the case study, an IoT-based enterprise information system (EIS) has been applied to investigate the effects of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on the adaptation mechanism to high altitude hypoxia. Two remarkable conclusions are (i) the levels of the STAT3 mRNA and protein vary from one tissue to another, and the highest level is in the lung tissue, and (ii) Tibetan antelope's expression of STAT3 mRNA and protein are higher than that from plain sheep. Based on the fact that a Tibetan antelope has a higher adaptability to hypoxia; it has illustrated that the hypoxic STAT3-specific expression is one of the molecular bases of high altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan antelope.",

abstract="The intelligent bed, a mechanical hospital bed equipped with several electronic sensor functions, is an assistive healthcare solution intended to reduce the manual workload of health professionals by providing valuable real-time and non-vital information about patients. Implementation of the intelligent bed in the Chinese health care context has not been fully studied. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of Chinese health professionals during a 12-month implementation period of the intelligent bed in a rehabilitation department at a large tertiary hospital in Guangzhou. A documentary study was carried out 3 months prior to implementation. Participant observation totalling 35 h and qualitative semi-structured interviews with 9 h and 50 min were conducted over a 12-month testing period. Findings in this study highlighted the improved working ergonomics of the intelligent bed in comparison with regular hospital mechanical beds. The bed's other advanced functions, however, were either not used by the staff, quickly abandoned after a month, or never fully implemented. Barriers to full implementation of the bed's functions were the Chinese hierarchical organizational culture, inadequate training of the health professionals on the implementation of the intelligent bed, lack of user-friendliness, and insufficient technical support.",

abstract="We study the potential of cognition and cooperation in Body Area Networks (BANs). On one hand, most BAN-based applications involve end-to-end transmission across heterogenous networks. Cognitive communication has been known to be an effective technology for addressing network heterogeneity. On the other hand, a BAN is normally required to provide reliable communications and operate in a very low power level to conserve energy and reduce the electromagnetic radiation impact on human body. Cooperative communication has been known to enhance the transmission reliability and maintain low transmission power. However, the joint cognitive and cooperative mechanism has not been investigated yet in the literature. In this paper, we propose a network architecture for cognitive and cooperative communications in BANs. An intelligent mobile device is introduced as either a cognitive gateway to interconnect heterogenous networks; or a cooperative relay node to achieve transmission diversity. Two cooperative transmission schemes, Energy-conserved Cooperative Transmission and Reliability-driven Cooperative Transmission, are presented for different applications that have distinct energy consumption or reliability requirement. Optimization problems are formulated to optimally allocate power in the cooperative transmission. Results indicate that cooperative transmission schemes can significantly decrease Bit Error Rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption, compared to the non-cooperative schemes. The BER gain is over one order in the high SNR region, while the energy consumption can save up to 50{\%} in the low BER region.",

abstract="Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a wireless technology used in various applications to minimize the complexity of everyday life. However, it opens a large number of security and privacy issues that require to be addressed before its successful deployment. Many RFID authentication protocols are proposed in recent years to address security and privacy issues, and most of them are based on lightweight cryptographic techniques such as pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), or bitwise logical operations. However, the existing RFID authentication protocols suffer from security weaknesses, and cannot solve most of the security and privacy problems. A new solution is necessary to address security and privacy issues. In this paper, an improved three-pass mutual authentication protocol (ITPMAP) for low-cost RFID tags is proposed to offer an adequate security level for RFID systems. The proposed ITPMAP protocol uses one PRNG on the tag side and heavy-weighted cryptographic techniques (i.e., digital signature and password-based encryption schemes) on the back-end server side instead of lightweight cryptographic techniques to address the security and privacy issues. The ITPMAP protocol is secure against various attacks such as cloning, spoofing, replay, and desynchronization attacks. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, the ITPMAP protocol is adopted to propose the design of three real-life RFID systems; namely: Signing and Verification of Graduation Certificate System, issuing and verification of e-ticketing system, and charging and discharging of prepaid card system. The Unified Modeling Language is used to demonstrate the design of the proposed ITPMAP protocol and systems. Java language is used for the implementation of the proposed systems. In addition, the ``Mifare Classic'' tags and readers are used as RFID apparatuses for the proposed systems.",

abstract="In this technological era, every person, authorities, entrepreneurs, businesses, and many things around us are connected to the internet, forming Internet of thing (IoT). This generates a massive amount of diverse data with very high-speed, termed as big data. However, this data is very useful that can be used as an asset for the businesses, organizations, and authorities to predict future in various aspects. However, efficiently processing Big Data while making real-time decisions is a quite challenging task. Some of the tools like Hadoop are used for Big Datasets processing. On the other hand, these tools could not perform well in the case of real-time high-speed stream processing. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Big Data stream processing approach while mapping Hadoop MapReduce equivalent mechanism on graphics processing units (GPUs). We integrated a parallel and distributed environment of Hadoop ecosystem and a real-time streaming processing tool, i.e., Spark with GPU to make the system more powerful in order to handle the overwhelming amount of high-speed streaming. We designed a MapReduce equivalent algorithm for GPUs for a statistical parameter calculation by dividing overall Big Data files into fixed-size blocks. Finally, the system is evaluated while considering the efficiency aspect (processing time and throughput) using (1) large-size city traffic video data captured by static as well as moving vehicles' cameras while identifying vehicles and (2) large text-based files, like twitter data files, structural data, etc. Results show that the proposed system working with Spark on top and GPUs under the parallel and distributed environment of Hadoop ecosystem is more efficient and real-time as compared to existing standalone CPU-based MapReduce implementation.",

abstract="Mobile crowd-sensing applications produce useful knowledge of the surrounding environment, which makes our life more predictable. However, these applications often require users to contribute, consciously or unconsciously, location-related data for analysis, which gravely encroaches users' location privacy. Aggregate processing is a feasible way for preserving user privacy to some extent, and based on the mode, some privacy-preserving schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes still cannot guarantee users' location privacy in the scenarios with low density participants. Meanwhile, user accountability also needs to be considered comprehensively to protect the system against malicious users. In this paper, we propose data aggregate statistics schemes with participant density-independent location privacy-protection for mobile crowd-sensing applications. First, we make use of multi-pseudonym mechanism to overcome the vulnerability due to low participant density. Then, to further handle sybil attacks, we propose two schemes based on the Paillier cryptosystem. In the basic scheme, we leverage non-interactive zero-knowledge proof technology to verify users' sensing data. In the advanced scheme, we present a novel verification framework, which also addresses the problem of user accountability, but at the cost of introducing a new entity. Finally, the theoretical analysis indicates that our scheme achieves the desired properties, and the performance experiments demonstrate that our scheme can achieve a balance among accuracy, privacy-protection and computational overhead.",

abstract="Cohort Study Platforms (CSP) are emerging as a key tool for collecting patient information, providing new research data, and supporting family and patient associations. However they pose new ethics and regulatory challenges since they cross the gap between patients and medical practitioners. One of the critical issues for CSP is to enforce a strict control on access privileges whilst allowing the users to take advantage of the breadth of the available data. We propose Cerberus, a new access control scheme spanning the whole life-cycle of access right management: design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, operations. Cerberus enables switching from a dual world, where CSP data can be accessed either from the users who entered it or fully de-identified, to an access-when-required world, where patients, practitioners and researchers can access focused medical data through explicit authorisation by the data owner. Efficient access control requires application-specific access rights, as well as the ability to restrict these rights when they are not used. Cerberus is implemented and evaluated in the context of the GENIDA project, an international CSP for Genetically determined Intellectual Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorders. As a result of this study, the software is made available for the community, and validated specifications for CSPs are given.",

Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud integration seems to be one of the winning solutions in order to opportunely manage the proliferation of both data and devices. In this paper, following the idea to reuse as much tooling as possible, we propose, with regards to infrastructure management, to adopt a widely used and competitive framework for Infrastructure-as-a-Service such as OpenStack. Therefore, we describe approaches and architectures so far preliminary implemented for enabling Cloud-mediated interactions with droves of sensor- and actuator-hosting nodes by presenting Stack4Things, a framework for Sensing-and-Actuation-as-a-Service (SAaaS). In particular, starting from a detailed requirement analysis, in this work, we focus on the subsystems of Stack4Things devoted to resource control and management as well as on those related to the management and collection of sensing data. Several use cases are presented justifying how our proposed framework can be viewed as a concrete step toward the complete fulfillment of the SAaaS vision.",

Due to the diverse number of possible applications, a flexible system architecture, which includes several different system versions, is proposed. Operation of the system is driven by user gestures. To demonstrate the concept of the proposed real-time biofeedback training system, an application for golf swing training is developed. The application implements the system using smartphone motion sensors and audio biofeedback and aids golfers in correcting unwanted head movements during a golf swing. The application is driven by a gesture user interface. During the golf swing, the application provides users with real-time audio feedback that signals head movement errors. The field test results show that the developed application can be used as an efficient tool in golf swing training.",

In the recent years, parallel, incremental, and multi-view machine learning algorithms have been proposed. Similarly, graph-based architectures and in-memory big data tools have been developed to minimize I/O cost and optimize iterative processing. However, standard big data architectures are still lacking. Also appropriate tools are not available for many important bioinformatics problems, such as fast construction of co-expression and regulatory networks and salient module identification, detection of complexes over growing protein-protein interaction data, fast analysis of massive DNA, RNA, and protein sequence data, and fast querying on incremental and heterogeneous disease networks.

abstract="Nanonetworks consist of nano-sized communicating devices which are able to perform simple tasks at the nanoscale. The limited capabilities of individual nanomachines and the Terahertz (THz) band channel behavior lead to error-prone wireless links. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis of error-control strategies for nanonetworks in the THz band is presented. A mathematical framework is developed and used to analyze the tradeoffs between Bit Error Rate, Packet Error Rate, energy consumption and latency, for five different error-control strategies, namely, Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), Forward Error Correction (FEC), two types of Error Prevention Codes (EPC) and a hybrid EPC. The cross-layer effects between the physical and the link layers as well as the impact of the nanomachine capabilities in both layers are taken into account. At the physical layer, nanomachines are considered to communicate by following a time-spread on-off keying modulation based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. At the link layer, nanomachines are considered to access the channel in an uncoordinated fashion, by leveraging the possibility to interleave pulse-based transmissions from different nodes. Throughout the analysis, accurate path loss, noise and multi-user interference models, validated by means of electromagnetic simulation, are utilized. In addition, the energy consumption and latency introduced by a hardware implementation of each error control technique, as well as, the additional constraints imposed by the use of energy-harvesting mechanisms to power the nanomachines, are taken into account. The results show that, despite their simplicity, EPCs outperform traditional ARQ and FEC schemes, in terms of error correcting capabilities, which results in further energy savings and reduced latency.",

For a single building to benefit from its own collected data, it will need to wait for a long time to collect sufficient data to build accurate models to help improve the smart buildings systems. Therefore, multiple buildings need to cooperate to amplify the benefits from the collected data and speed up the model building processes. Apparently, this is not so trivial and there are associated challenges. In this paper, we study the importance of collaborative data analytics for smart buildings, its benefits, as well as presently possible models of carrying it out. Furthermore, we present a framework for collaborative fault detection and diagnosis as a case of collaborative data analytics for smart buildings. We also provide a preliminary analysis of the energy efficiency benefit of such collaborative framework for smart buildings. The result shows that significant energy savings can be achieved for smart buildings using collaborative data analytics.",

To this regard, we consider two clusters as interfering if their hop distance is at most                                                                           {\$}{\$}t{\$}{\$}                                                            t                                                      , with                                                                           {\$}{\$}t{\backslash}ge 2{\$}{\$}                                                                                    t                        ≥                        2                                                                            , in the cluster connectivity graph.

abstract="New healthcare technologies are emerging with the increasing age of the society, where the development of smart homes for monitoring the elders' activities is in the center of them. Identifying the resident's activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12{\%} improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition, which used dynamic segmentation. The f-measure metric demonstrated up to 12.73{\%} improvement.",

abstract="As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?",

Cloud computing (CC) could help bridge the gaps between wireless communication and data generated through environmental and/or health interventions. This study offers a conceptual framework of a cloud-based decision support system for arsenic health risk assessment (CC-AHRA). It also explains how the CC-AHRA could help assist exposed communities in assessing cancer risk due to arsenic exposure through drinking water. The study also discusses how the CC-AHRA can help water management authorities, professionals, researchers, and private enterprises in making informed decisions toward reducing the likely health risks due to arsenic consumption.",

abstract="Based on the concept of data physicalization, we developed Vital + Morph, an interactive surface for remote connection and awareness of clinical data. It enables users located in remote places to monitor and feel the vital signs measured from a hospitalized person through shape-change. We propose shape-changing interfaces as a way of making data physicalization a richer, intriguing and memorable experience that communicates complex information and insights about data. To demonstrate and validate our proposed concept, we developed an exploratory study about the design and its implications. For evaluating the social impact of shape-changing interfaces in the context of remote monitoring, we presented Vital + Morph in several Media Art festivals. We collected and analyzed the feedback from the visitors during the exhibitions, and discussed the possibilities of the proposed system. A preliminary evaluation shows how shape-changing displays are perceived by users, which establishes not only the potential benefits but also highlights the concerns that several users have raised. Through this study, we aim to contribute to the design of remote monitoring systems by providing a novel approach for displaying clinical data that consider the richness of the physical world. In today's information-driven society, we should not just focus on how abstract data are collected and analyzed, but also on how it can be presented and incorporated into our daily lives.",

abstract="We are living in an era when the focus of human relationships with the world is shifting from execution and physical impact to control and cognitive/informational interaction. This emerging, increasingly informational world is our new ecology, an infosphere that presents the grounds for a cognitive revolution based on interactions in networks of biological and artificial, intelligent agents. After the industrial revolution, which extended the human body through mechanical machinery, the cognitive revolution extends the human mind/cognition through information-processing machinery. These novel circumstances come with new qualities and preferences demanding new conceptualizations. We have some work ahead of us to establish value systems and practices extended from the real to the increasingly virtual/info-computational. This paper first presents a current view of the virtual versus the real and then offers an interpretation framework based on an info-computational understanding of cognition in which agency implies computational processing of informational structures of the world as an infosphere. The notion of ``good life'' is discussed in light of different ideals of well-being in the infosphere, connecting virtuality as a space of potential and alternative worlds for an agent for whom the reality is a space of actual experiences, in the sense of Deleuze. Even though info-computational framework enables us to see both the real world and the diversity of virtual worlds in terms of computational processes on informational structures, based on a distinct layered cognitive architecture of all physical agents, there is clear difference between potential worlds of the virtual and actual agent's experiences made in the real. Info-computationalism enables insight into the mechanisms of infosphere and elucidates its importance as cognitively predominant environment and communication media. The conclusion is that by cocooning ourselves in an elaborate info-computational infrastructure of the virtual, we may be increasingly isolating ourselves from the reality of direct experience of the world. The biggest challenges of the cognitive revolution may not be technological but ethical. They are about the nature of being human and its values.",

The studies focused on usability aspects including perceived usefulness, ease of use, intention of use and user experience. In the first study, we used self-report techniques to gather data, and found that previous technological experience had a significant effect on the perceived anxiety of elders; while on the second study, we used indirect observation techniques to gather data, and found that previous technological experience had a significant effect on the perceived enjoyment of elders. After a further analysis of the video recordings of the playing sessions, we identified that elders developed two different approaches to their using the application (explore-and-learn and score-and-compete), which could be related to their previous technological experience, and explain the identified differences. We observed that in the presence of problems, the response of participants was different depending on the adopted behavior. Based on this evidence, we distilled a set of preliminary guidelines to foster or inhibit certain behaviors and outcomes related to the effect of previous experience that were observed during our evaluation studies of virtual tools for the cognitive stimulation and physical activation of the elderly.",

abstract="In an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, service composition and collaboration among heterogeneous resources are required. Thus, an infrastructure that supports these requirements is an essential factor in a seamless service delivery. For these requirements, mobile devices should have multiple functions. However, the miniaturization of mobile devices is another requirement, and a trade-off between the two requirements is naturally generated. My previous study proposed the resource collaboration system that provides a service consisting of shareable resources in the surrounding area to solve the resource limitations of devices. Reducing the processing time for generating the recommendation and improving user satisfaction about the results are important factors, particularly for a small mobile device with limited resources. This study analyzes and classifies personal user preferences from resource usage history based on the Myers-Briggs type indicator. The study also proposes a method to recommend customized resources for classified user types. Results show that the proposed method reduces the recommendation time and increases user satisfaction.",

abstract="An increasing percentage of the population needs assistance services for a wide range of activities related to their independent living, which can be delivered either by humans or by machines. While cloud computing and emerging ICT solutions have introduced new types of services and service delivery paradigms, it remains costly and difficult to set up and market assistance services addressing the needs of very narrow end-user groups. The current work presents the design of a novel open-source infrastructure (web-based platform) which enables diverse stakeholders to easily set up web-based assistance-on-demand platform instances. Each of these AoD instances can be used by service providers to register and offer assistance-on-demand (AoD) services for catering individual needs of persons with disabilities. In this way, narrow end-user groups can be reached and enjoy a gamut of assistance services. The AoD platform is implemented in the context of a larger Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), which is being developed in the context of the Prosperity4All project. The functional requirements for the design of the AoD infrastructure were iteratively fine-tuned through the definition and analysis of representative use models (sets of personas and use cases). The AoD platform architecture consists of two major components: front-end (GUI) and back-end (service infrastructure). Their implementation is mainly based on the Django framework which enables a Model--Template--View (MTV) software architectural pattern with highly configurable and flexible components. The evaluation of a demonstration instance of the AoD platform with end-users identified its advantages and pointed out additional functionality needed: multi-language, multi-modality, embedded social media feeding, dedicated menu for highly flexible service, etc. The overall perceived usefulness of the specific demonstration AoD platform instance that underwent evaluation was higher than 80{\%}. The proposed AoD platform provides a flexible and sufficiently generic web-based infrastructure for the cost-effective setup, registration and web publication of services that can accommodate a highly diverse range of assistance needs. Furthermore, it is suitable for use by a wide range of different stakeholder/user groups interested in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities or otherwise at risk of exclusion.",

abstract="This study investigated the core motivations for adopting smart home services and explored the approaches and processes through which the motivations were incorporated with the original technology acceptance model (TAM) and the acceptance of the services. To achieve this purpose, an Internet survey was conducted in South Korea. The data (N = 799) from the survey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis. The results suggested that the perceived compatibility, connectedness, control, system reliability, and enjoyment of smart home services were positively related to the users' intention to use the services, whereas there was a negative association between the perceived cost and usage intention. The structural results also provided evidence of the validity of the original TAM. Although smart home services have attracted users' interest in the housing context, only a few studies have examined how the users' intention to use the services is motivated. The present study represents an initial step to explore the process of adopting smart home services with potential future research areas.",

Automated decisions impact everyone, occurring routinely in education, employment, health care, credit, and government services. Technologies that generate tracking data, including smartphones, credit cards, websites, social media, and sensors, offer unprecedented benefits. However, people are vulnerable to errors and biases in the underlying data and algorithms, especially those with mental illness. Algorithms based on big data from seemingly unrelated sources may create obstacles to community integration. Voluntary online self-disclosure and constant tracking blur traditional concepts of public versus private data, medical versus non-medical data, and human versus automated decision-making. In contrast to sharing sensitive information with a physician in a confidential relationship, there may be numerous readers of information revealed online; data may be sold repeatedly; used in proprietary algorithms; and are effectively permanent. Technological changes challenge traditional norms affecting privacy and decision-making, and continued discussions on new approaches to provide privacy protections are needed.",

abstract="This paper undertakes a comparative legal study to analyze the challenges of privacy and personal data protection posed by Artificial Intelligence (``AI'') embedded in Robots, and to offer policy suggestions. After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (``PbD'') originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the ``context'' should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the ``algorithmic black box'' or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination. If AI surpasses human intelligence, a terminating function, such as a ``kill switch'' will be the last resort to preserve individual choice. Despite numerous difficulties, we must prepare for the coming AI-prevalent society by taking a flexible approach.",

abstract="Plant disease detection attracts significant attention in the field of agriculture where image based disease detection plays an important role. To improve the yield of plants, it is necessary to detect the onset of diseases in plants and advice the farmers to act based on the suggestions. In this paper, a novel web enabled disease detection system (WEDDS) based on compressed sensing (CS) is proposed to detect and classify the diseases in leaves. Statistical based thresholding strategy is proposed for segmentation of the diseased leaf. CS measurements of the segmented leaf are uploaded to the cloud to reduce the storage complexity. At the monitoring site, the measurements are retrieved and the features are extracted from the reconstructed segmented image. The analysis and classification is done using support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed WEDDS has been evaluated in terms of accuracy and is compared with the existing techniques. The WEDDS was also evaluated experimentally using Raspberry pi 3 board. The results show that the proposed method provides an overall detection accuracy of 98.5{\%} and classification accuracy of 98.4{\%}.",

abstract="Activity  recognition in smart environments is an evolving research problem due to the advancement and proliferation of sensing, monitoring and actuation technologies to make it possible for large scale and real deployment. While activities in smart home are interleaved, complex and volatile; the number of inhabitants in the environment is also dynamic. A key challenge in designing robust smart home activity recognition approaches is to exploit the users' spatiotemporal behavior and location, focus on the availability of multitude of devices capable of providing different dimensions of information and fulfill the underpinning needs for scaling the system beyond a single user or a home environment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for recognizing complex activities of daily living (ADL), that lie in between the two extremes of intensive use of body-worn sensors and the use of ambient sensors. Our approach harnesses the power of simple ambient sensors (e.g., motion sensors) to provide additional `hidden' context (e.g., room-level location) of an individual, and then combines this context with smartphone-based sensing of micro-level postural/locomotive states. The major novelty is our focus on multi-inhabitant environments, where we show how the use of spatiotemporal constraints along with multitude of data sources can be used to significantly improve the accuracy and computational overhead of traditional activity recognition based approaches such as coupled-hidden Markov models. Experimental results on two separate smart home datasets demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of complex ADL classification by over 30 {\%}, compared to pure smartphone-based solutions.",

abstract="Due to the technological advancement in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), sensor node mobility becomes a basic requirement for many extensive applications. Routing protocol designed for LLNs must ensure real-time data transmission with minimum power consumption. However, the existing mobility support protocols cannot work efficiently in LLNs as they are unable to adapt to the change in the network topology quickly. Therefore, we propose an Enhanced Routing Protocol for LLNs (ERPL), which updates the Preferred Parent (PP) of the Mobile Node (MN) quickly whenever the MN moves away from the already selected PP. Further, a new objective function that takes the mobility of the node into an account while selecting a PP is proposed. Performance of the ERPL has been evaluated with the varying system and traffic parameters under different topologies similar to most of the real-life networks. The simulation results showed that the proposed ERPL reduced the power consumption, packet overhead, latency and increased the packet delivery ratio as compared to other existing works.",

abstract="To address the incomplete problem in pulmonary parenchyma segmentation based on the traditional methods, a novel automated segmentation method based on an eight-neighbor region growing algorithm with left-right scanning and four-corner rotating and scanning is proposed in this paper. The proposed method consists of four main stages: image binarization, rough segmentation of lung, image denoising and lung contour refining. First, the binarization of images is done and the regions of interest are extracted. After that, the rough segmentation of lung is performed through a general region growing method. Then the improved eight-neighbor region growing is used to remove noise for the upper, middle, and bottom region of lung. Finally, corrosion and expansion operations are utilized to smooth the lung boundary. The proposed method was validated on chest positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) data of 30 cases from a hospital in Shanxi, China. Experimental results show that our method can achieve an average volume overlap ratio of 96.21 {\textpm} 0.39{\%} with the manual segmentation results. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm segments the lung in PET-CT images more efficiently and accurately.",

Existing research about elderly drivers mainly focuses on factual data collection and analysis, indicating the elderly's growing fatal accident rates and their different behaviours compared to younger drivers. However, few research has focused on design-led practical solutions to mitigate the elderly's growing fatal accidents, by considering their usability and body conditions, afflicting the elderly, such as decreased vision, hearing, and reaction times. In this paper, first, current worldwide situations on growing fatal accident rates for elderly drivers is reviewed and the key impact factors are identified and discussed with regarding to usability and design trend in the automotive technology for elderly. Second, existing smart vehicle technology-based solutions to promote safe driving are explored and their pros and cons are discussed and analysed. Most of solutions are not created by people with driving difficulties, which are caused by health problems most commonly afflicting the elderly. Thirdly, diverse design-led research activities are taken, such as a survey, observation, and interviews to gain new understanding of what kinds of driving problems elderly drivers have and demonstrate how new system concepts could be developed for the elderly's benefits. Finally, it is found that the elderly's low vision and late reaction are main factors causing their driving difficulties. Based on this finding, usable vehicle system design ideas have been proposed, by utilising facial expression sensing technology as a solution. The proposed solutions would ensure reducing both the elderly's driving problems and high fatal accident rates and provide a more enjoyable driving environment for the elderly population.",

Studies have shown that office workers perform certain jobs better and joggers run longer distances when listening to music. However, a personalized music system which can automatically recommend songs according to user's physiological response remains absent. Therefore, this study aims to establish an intelligent music selection system for individual users to enhance their learning performance. We first created an emotional music database using data analytics classifications. During testing, innovative wearable sensing devices were used to detect heart rate variability (HRV) in experiments, which subsequently guided music selection. User emotions were then analyzed and appropriate songs were selected by using the proposed application software (App). Machine learning was used to record user preference, ensuring accurate and precise classification. Significant results generated through experimental validation indicate that this system generates high satisfaction levels, does not increase mental workload, and improves users' performance. Under the trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the continuing development of wearable devices, the proposed system could stimulate innovative applications for smart factory, home, and health care.",

Through dividing the system into different functional modules and assigning these modules to components in Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA), we can adopt a new method to realize the modeling and evaluating the working process of real-time positioning and route planning in ITS. Meanwhile, the fluid flow approximation is employed to conduct a performance analysis through PEPA models, guaranteeing that the response time, the maximum utilization and the throughput of the system can be achieved and analyzed.",

abstract="This paper presents a robust data authentication scheme for protecting data integrity and availability in unattended wireless sensor networks. Such networks are vulnerable to several types of attacks. In particular, attackers can compromise a subset of nodes and use these nodes to transmit modified data or to prevent genuine data from being verified. The presented scheme combines security against data modification and denial of service attacks with traffic and storage efficiency. This is achieved by involving all sensor nodes in the network in the authentication process, implementing cooperative authentication with multiple authenticators, and using dual storage. Detailed analysis and extensive simulation tests show that our scheme achieves better performance compared to related schemes published in the literature in terms of traffic, storage, security against DoS attacks, and security against data replacement attacks.",

abstract="Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a promising wireless network technology, in the context of body area network (BAN) applications, to provide the required quality of service support concerning the communication between sensor nodes placed on a user's body and a personal device, such as a smartphone. Most previous BLE performance studies in the literature have focused primarily in networks with a single slave (point-to-point link) or traffic scenarios with relatively low data rate. However, many BAN sensors generate high data rate traffic, and several sensor nodes (slaves) may be actively sending data in the same BAN. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of the suitability of BLE mainly under these conditions. Results show that, for the same traffic, the BLE protocol presents lower energy consumption and supports more sensor nodes than an alternative IEEE 802.15.4-based protocol. This study also identifies and characterizes some implementation constraints on the tested platforms that impose limits on the achievable performance.",

The sensor nodes along with the data, while in transit, must be protected from malicious attackers. Though using public key cryptographic schemes like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography would provide sufficient security. Their use has been limited owing to their computationally intensive operations which conflict with the resource limitations in wireless sensor nodes. Key pre-distribution has proved to be the most feasible amongst key management schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Research in key management continues to take center stage due to its importance amongst security primitives in WSNs. An improved energy efficient key distribution and management scheme is proposed in this paper.

Array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is considered as a major task when measuring the DNA copy number change across the genome. Moreover, DNA copy number change is an essential measure to diagnose the cancer disease. Next generation sequencing is an important method for studying the spread of infectious disease qualitatively and quantitatively. CGH is widely used in continuous monitoring of copy number of thousands of genes throughout the genome. In recent years, the size of the DNA sequence data is very large. Hence, there is a need to use a scalable machine learning approach to overcome the various issues in DNA copy number change detection. In this paper, we use a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian Mixture (GM) Clustering approach to model the DNA copy number change across the genome. The proposed Bayesian HMM with GM Clustering approach is compared with various existing approaches such as Pruned Exact Linear Time method, binary segmentation method and segment neighborhood method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed change detection algorithm.",

abstract="Machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies for wearable healthcare services are now being considered as a cutting-edge solution to provide care for the aging population that is rapidly growing. M2M systems consist of sensors, actuators, and communications modules that can achieve various purposes. With respect to communications, wireless body area networks (WBANs) are highly suitable communication technologies for wearable M2M. Most existing research for WBANs have mainly focused on a one-hop star network configuration due to their ease of implementation. However, in an environment with a real wearable M2M system, a multi-hop network can be a more suitable solution for communication due to its various advantages, including a low heat generation, low path loss, low inter-network interference, etc., despite the high difficulty in management. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN configuration approach (MWCA) for wearable M2M systems. MWCA improves network throughput by exploiting multi-channel communications, and it achieves high energy efficiency by reducing the transmission power of each M2M device. We also investigate the performance of MWCA by using an analytical model, which is validated through the use of experimental simulations.",

abstract="Some of the recent attempts for improving and transforming engineering education are reviewed. The attempts aim at providing the entry level engineers with the skills needed to address the challenges of future large-scale complex systems and projects. Some of the frontier sectors and future challenges for engineers are outlined. The major characteristics of the coming intelligence convergence era (the post-information age) are identified. These include the prevalence of smart devices and environments, the widespread applications of anticipatory computing and predictive / prescriptive analytics, as well as a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. Devices and machines will be able to learn from, and with, humans in a natural collaborative way. The recent game changers in learnscapes (learning paradigms, technologies, platforms, spaces, and environments) that can significantly impact engineering education in the coming era are identified. Among these are open educational resources, knowledge-rich classrooms, immersive interactive 3D learning, augmented reality, reverse instruction / flipped classroom, gamification, robots in the classroom, and adaptive personalized learning. Significant transformative changes in, and mass customization of, learning are envisioned to emerge from the synergistic combination of the game changers and other technologies. The realization of the aforementioned vision requires the development of a new multidisciplinary framework of emergent engineering for relating innovation, complexity and cybernetics, within the future learning environments. The framework can be used to treat engineering education as a complex adaptive system, with dynamically interacting and communicating components (instructors, individual, small, and large groups of learners). The emergent behavior resulting from the interactions can produce progressively better, and continuously improving, learning environment. As a first step towards the realization of the vision, intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystems need to be developed to facilitate collaboration between the various stakeholders of engineering education, and to accelerate the development of a skilled engineering workforce. The major components of the ecosystems include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities, blended learning and research spaces, novel ultra-intelligent software agents, multimodal and autonomous interfaces, and networked cognitive and tele-presence robots.",

In this paper, we put human into the traditional CPS data process model and formulate a closed-loop computing paradigm for CPS data and decision intelligence. We propose a human-in-the-loop reference model for CPS, which extends the traditional cyber-physical interaction into a closed-loop process based on cyber, physical and human factors. We define the key features of human-in-the-loop CPS, summarize it as three aspects: semantic, interactive, iterative and analyze the major challenges from the perspective of data characteristics. Recent progresses in three typical application domains are reviewed and examined for their decision models and whether they have solved the target issues of human-in-the-loop CPS. According to the review and comparison, the paper finally summarizes several key future opportunities to establish an intelligent human-in-the-loop CPS.",

abstract="Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have become a weapon of choice for hackers, cyber extortionists, and cyber terrorists. These attacks can swiftly incapacitate a victim, causing huge revenue losses. Despite the large number of traditional mitigation solutions that exists today, DDoS attacks continue to grow in frequency, volume, and severity. This calls for a new network paradigm to address the requirements of today's challenging security threats. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which has gained significant traction by many researchers to address the requirement of today's data centers. Inspired by the capabilities of SDN, we present a comprehensive survey of existing SDN-based DDoS attack detection and mitigation solutions. We classify solutions based on DDoS attack detection techniques and identify requirements of an effective solution. Based on our findings, we propose a novel framework for detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks in a large-scale network which comprises a smart city built on SDN infrastructure. Our proposed framework is capable of meeting application-specific DDoS attack detection and mitigation requirements. The primary contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide an in-depth survey and discussion of SDN-based DDoS attack detection and mitigation mechanisms, and we classify them with respect to the detection techniques. Second, leveraging the characteristics of SDN for network security, we propose and present an SDN-based proactive DDoS Defense Framework (ProDefense). We show how this framework can be utilized to secure applications built for smart cities. Moreover, the paper highlights open research challenges, future research directions, and recommendations related to SDN-based DDoS detection and mitigation.",

abstract="Reducing the total power consumption and network delay are among the most interesting issues facing large-scale Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) systems and their ability to satisfy the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Such systems utilize cloud computing infrastructure to support offloading some of user's computationally heavy tasks to the cloud's datacenters. However, the delay incurred by such offloading process lead the use of servers (called cloudlets) placed in the physical proximity of the users, creating what is known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The cloudlet-based infrastructure has its challenges such as the limited capabilities of the cloudlet system (in terms of the ability to serve different request types from users in vast geographical regions). To cover the users demand for different types of services and in vast geographical regions, cloudlets cooperate among each other by passing user requests from one cloudlet to another. This cooperation affects both power consumption and delay. In this work, we present a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model for MEC systems with these two issues in mind. Specifically, we consider two types of cloudlets: local cloudlets and global cloudlets, which have higher capabilities. A user connects to a local cloudlet and sends all of its traffics to it. If the local cloudlet cannot serve the desired request, then the request is moved to another local cloudlet. If no local cloudlet can serve the request, then it is moved to a global cloudlet which can serve all service types. The process of routing requests through the hierarchical network of cloudlets increases power consumption and delay. Our model minimizes power consumption while incurring an acceptable amount of delay. We evaluate it under several realistic scenarios to show that it can indeed be used for power optimization of large-scale MEC systems without violating delay constraints.",

Despite mature knowledge, many approaches have been criticized to lack guidance on how to put process improvement into practice. Given the variety of emerging digital technologies, organizations not only face a process improvement black box, but also high uncertainty regarding digital technologies. This paper thus proposes a method that supports organizations in exploiting the digitalization potential of their business processes. To achieve this, action design research and situational method engineering were adopted. Two design cycles involving practitioners (i.e., managers and BPM experts) and end-users (i.e., process owners and participants) were conducted. In the first cycle, the method's alpha version was evaluated by interviewing practitioners from five organizations. In the second cycle, the beta version was evaluated via real-world case studies. In this paper, detailed results of one case study, which was conducted at a semiconductor manufacturer, are included.",

The study fills this gap by examining heterogeneity of family firms owned and managed by women, in the context of a developing country---Brazil. The study draws upon the resource-based view of the firm to investigate the relationships between firm performance, family involvement, and financial resources at the start-up phase. An inductive analysis reveals two patterns. First, family firms that are started with the family achieve better performance than firms that are launched without the family and later evolve into a family business. Second, family firms that are funded with women entrepreneur's own savings achieve worse performance than family firms that are started with borrowed funds. The results are useful for strategic decision making in fostering family businesses headed by women and proactive public policies for future innovation to enhance the success of women entrepreneurs.",

abstract="It is expected that the LTE network, which includes the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN) in 3GPP LTE systems, will be overloaded due to the huge number of Machine-Type Communication (MTC) devices in the near future. Overload in the RAN and CN of the LTE may result in congestion occurrence, resource waste, Quality of Service (QoS) degradation and in the worst-case, it will cause service unavailability. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive mechanism to manage a large number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN of the LTE network. We use Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme to regulate the MTC traffic according to the congestions level in the RAN and CN. We consider a scenario in which two-priority-based classes of MTC devices are contending for the RAN resources. At first, the overload problem in the RAN is formulated to find the number of allowable contending MTC devices of each class taking into account their required QoS. Then, an active load management policy based on additive increase multiplicative decrease rule is proposed to control the incoming load from multiple cells to the CN. To effectively limit the number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN, in the proposed approach, each Evolved Node B updates the ACB factor upon overload detection in the RAN or CN in an adaptive manner. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is able to manage overload in the CN and RAN simultaneously.",

abstract="Compared to the previous generations of mobile networks, 5G will provide a significant paradigm shift by including beyond state of the art technical solutions, like very high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, extreme base station and device densities, and very high number of transceiver antennas. However, unlike the previous generations, it will also be highly integrative and backward compatible: combining the novel 5G air interface and spectrum together with legacy wireless systems like LTE/LTE-A and WiFi, in order to facilitate an umbrella of high-rate coverage and a seamless user experience. In order to support this advances in the radio interface, the core network will also have to reach unprecedented levels of elasticity and intelligence. Spectrum regulation will need to be rethought and significantly improved, whereas energy and cost efficiencies will become one of the key parameters that will steer the 5G design and development. This paper elaborates on the 5G related topics, identifying the key challenges for future research and preliminary 5G standardization activities, as well as providing a comprehensive survey of the current literature.",

abstract="In recent years, the number of applications utilizing mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has increased, with the intent of localization for the purposes of monitoring and obtaining data from hazardous areas. Location of the event is very critical in WSN, as sensing data is almost meaningless without the location information. In this paper, two Monte Carlo based localization schemes termed MCL and MSL* are studied. MCL obtains its location through anchor nodes whereas MSL* uses both anchor nodes and normal nodes. The use of normal nodes would increase accuracy and reduce dependency on anchor nodes, but increases communication costs. For this reason, we introduce a new approach called low communication cost schemes to reduce communication cost. Unlike MSL* which chooses all normal nodes found in the neighbor, the proposed scheme uses set theory to only select intersected nodes. To evaluate our method, we simulate in our proposed scheme the use of the same MSL* settings and simulators. From the simulation, we find out that our proposed scheme is able to reduce communication cost---the number of messages sent---by a minimum of 0.02 and a maximum of 0.30 with an average of 0.18, for varying node densities from 6 to 20, while nonetheless able to retain similar MSL* accuracy rates.",

title="Improved peak detection technique for robust PPG-based heartrate monitoring system on smartphones",
journal="Multimedia Tools and Applications",

day="17",
abstract="Heartrate monitoring can be very decisive in terms of detecting heart-related diseases in early stages. Given that smartphones are used almost ubiquitously by humans on a daily basis and that they are equipped with several sensors and a powerful CPU, they are the ideal tools to accomplish daily heartrate monitoring. Many studies have shown the possibility of monitoring the heartrate in a very accurate way by using smartphone camera and the photo-plethysmography technique. However, in real cases, when using a smartphone camera as the input sensor, the pulse signal usually contains noise caused by fingertip movements, pressure changes between the smartphone camera and the fingertip, or changes in ambient light intensity. Hence, many techniques have been proposed to filter and detect real peaks in the pulse signal and avoid noise peaks. Most of those state-of-the-art techniques rely on the assumption that real peaks are those having the maximum values in their respective cycles. In some cases, the assumption is not correct, which decreases the accuracy of peak detection. Hence, this paper proposes a novel method to detect a pulse signal's real peaks. The proposed method first smoothens a pulse signal by using a second-order Butterworth band-pass filter over a wide frequency range. Then, it considers the local minima of the signal as peaks and builds an optimization tree based on statistical properties, such as uniformity of peak time locations, peak count within a period, and variance in times elapsed between adjacent peaks, to detect combinations of peaks that optimize the heartrate computation. Results from experiments conducted using synthetic and real signals show that the proposed method can detect a pulse signal's real peaks with higher precision as compared to conventional methods, and is very robust to signal noises. The proposed method has a significant heartrate estimation accuracy in various real scenarios and across smartphone models; its error rate is as low as 0.8588{\textpm}0.0653 beats per minute, even in cases of signals with extensive noise.",

title="An improved ant colony optimization-based approach with mobile sink for wireless sensor networks",
journal="The Journal of Supercomputing",
year="2017",
month="Aug",
day="01",
abstract="Traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with one static sink node suffer from the well-known hot spot problem, that of sensor nodes near the static sink bear more traffic load than outlying nodes. Thus, the overall network lifetime is reduced due to the fact some nodes deplete their energy reserves much faster compared to the rest. Recently, adopting sink mobility has been considered as a good strategy to overcome the hot spot problem. Mobile sink(s) physically move within the network and communicate with selected nodes, such as cluster heads (CHs), to perform direct data collection through short-range communications that requires no routing. Finding an optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink is critical in order to achieve energy efficiency. Taking hints from nature, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been seen as a good solution to finding an optimal traversal path. Whereas the traditional ACO algorithm will guide ants to take a small step to the next node using current information, over time they will deviate from the target. Likewise, a mobile sink may communicate with selected node for a relatively long time making the traditional ACO algorithm delays not suitable for high real-time WSNs applications. In this paper, we propose an improved ACO algorithm approach for WSNs that use mobile sinks by considering CH distances. In this research, the network is divided into several clusters and each cluster has one CH. While the distance between CHs is considered under the traditional ACO algorithm, the mobile sink node finds an optimal mobility trajectory to communicate with CHs under our improved ACO algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve wireless sensor network performance compared to other routing algorithms.",

First, as stated in McKinsey {\&} Company's Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products -- consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner's reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.

abstract="Efficient key establishment is an important problem for secure group communications. The communication and storage complexity of group key establishment problem has been studied extensively. In this paper, we propose a new group key establishment protocol whose computation complexity is significantly reduced. Instead of using classic secret sharing, the protocol only employs a linear secret sharing scheme, using Vandermonde Matrix, to distribute group key efficiently. This protocol drastically reduces the computation load of each group member and maintains at least the same security degree compared to existing schemes employing traditional secret sharing. The security strength of this scheme is evaluated in detail. Such a protocol is desirable for many wireless applications where portable devices or sensors need to reduce their computation as much as possible due to battery power limitations. This protocol provides much lower computation complexity while maintaining low and balanced communication complexity and storage complexity for secure group key establishment.",

abstract="Herein demonstrated experiment studies two methods, namely convection and body resistance, to approximate human core body temperature. The proposed system is highly energy efficient that consumes only 165 mW power and runs on 5 VDC source. The implemented solution employs an IR thermographic sensor of industry grade along with AT Mega 328 breakout board. Ordinarily, the IR sensor is placed 1.5--30 cm away from human forehead (i.e., non-invasive) and measured the raw data in terms of skin and ambient temperature which is then converted using appropriate approximation formula to find out core body temperature. The raw data is plotted, visualized, and stored instantaneously in a local machine by means of two tools such as Makerplot, and JAVA-JAR. The test is performed when human object is in complete rest and after 10 min of walk. Achieved results are compared with the CoreTemp CM-210 sensor (by Terumo, Japan) which is calculated to be 0.7 {\textdegree}F different from the average value of BCT, obtained by the proposed IR sensor system. Upon a slight modification, the presented model can be connected with a remotely placed Internet of Things cloud service, which may be useful to inform and predict the user's core body temperature through a probabilistic view. It is also comprehended that such system can be useful as wearable device to be worn on at the hat attachable way.",

abstract="To facilitate the travel preparation process to a city, a lot of work has been done to recommend a POI or a sequence of POIs automatically to satisfy users' needs. However, most of the existing work ignores the issue of planning the detailed travel routes between POIs, leaving the task to online map services or commercial GPS navigators. Such a service or navigator in terms of suggesting the shortest travel distance or time, which cannot meet the diverse requirements of users. For instance, in the case of traveling by driving for leisure purpose, the scenic view along the travel routes would be of great importance to users, and a good planning service should put the sceneries of the route in higher priority rather than the distance or time taken. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called ScenicPlanner for route recommendation, leveraging a combination of geotagged image and check-in digital footprints from locationbased social networks (LBSNs). First, we enrich the road network and assign a proper scenic view score to each road segment to model the scenic road network, by extracting relevant information from geo-tagged images and check-ins. Then, we apply heuristic algorithms to iteratively add road segment and determine the travelling order of added road segments with the objective of maximizing the total scenic view score while satisfying the user-specified constraints (i.e., origin, destination and the total travel distance). Finally, to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world data sets from the Bay Area in the city of San Francisco, which contain a road network crawled from OpenStreetMap, more than 31 000 geo-tagged images generated by 1 571 Flickr users in one year, and 110 214 check-ins left by 15 680 Foursquare users in six months.",

abstract="Activity recognition is an important step towards monitoring and evaluating the functional health of an individual, and it potentially promotes human-centric ubiquitous applications in smart homes particularly for senior healthcare. The nature of human activity characterized by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty, however, poses a great challenge to the design of good feature representations and the optimization of classifiers towards building a robust model for human activity recognition. In this study, we propose to exploit deep learning techniques to automatically learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminative latent patterns inherent in the simple low-level features. Specifically, we extract high-level features with a stacked autoencoder that has a deep and hierarchy architecture, and combine feature learning and classifier construction into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. Besides, we investigate two different original feature representations of the sensor data for latent feature learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available smart home datasets, and compare it with a range of shallow models in terms of time-slice accuracy and class accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better recognition rates and generalizes better across different original feature representations, indicating its applicability to the real-world activity recognition.",

Our post hoc analysis results suggest that better traceability from the sources makes team-level requirements modeling more focused, whereas the lack of traceability makes it less fruitful. Our work not only shifts the case study from an exploratory to an explanatory nature, but also proposes the integration of conflict-centric views into viewpoint merging to further improve the understanding about stakeholder requirements' trade-offs.",

abstract="The paper analyses the drawbacks and the potential diseconomies of the attempt to optimize a supply chain in a holistic manner. The conclusion derived by the author is that this is neither a viable nor a beneficial idea. As a consequence he advocates a paradigm shift. The concept of totally integrated supply chains should be replaced by the idea of loosely coupled processes and planning systems run by companies who preserve their autonomy and use competition as an incentive system and a source of energy and flexibility. These companies should interconnect on a bilateral level in order to exchange information about updated demand forecasts and the availability of capacities. But they should not develop strongly integrated networks who start competing with other supply chains on the level of this new identity.",

abstract="Greater urbanization does not only mean higher concentrations of population and economic activities, but also increasing complexity and infrastructure interdependencies in the delivery of critical urban services such as energy, water, transport and communication. This paper reviews the current literature in these areas and identifies critical research and development challenges from the perspective---and for the benefit---of key stakeholders, considering their primary decision goals and context. From this vantage point, the critical evaluation framework is extended to include a classification of disruptions and extreme events and an overview of infrastructure modeling approaches and broader socioeconomic impacts assessment methods. Mapping the range of modeling and assessment methods against different decision contexts, critical gaps in knowledge and tools are identified to support the latter. Deep uncertainties characterize the challenge as each major component in the information and decision-making chain---from the frequency and intensity of a disruptive event, to assessing the first-order and immediate impacts of an infrastructure failure, to estimating the nature, extent and impact of cascading failures---multiplies the uncertainties. The emerging research challenges to deal with these interdependencies and uncertainties are discussed.",

abstract="The popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is rapidly growing due to its wide-ranged applications such as industrial diagnostics, environment monitoring or surveillance. High-quality construction of WSNs is increasingly demanding due to the ubiquity of WSNs. The current work is focused on improving one of the most crucial criteria that appear to exert an enormous impact on the WSNs performance, namely the area coverage. The proposed model is involved with sensor nodes deployment which maximizes the area coverage. This problem is proved to be NP-hard. Although such algorithms to handle this problem with fairly acceptable solutions had been introduced, most of them still heavily suffer from several issues including the large computation time and solution instability. Hence, the existing work proposed ways to overcome such difficulties by proposing two nature-based algorithms, namely Improved Cuckoo Search (ICS) and Chaotic Flower Pollination algorithm (CFPA). By adopting the concept of calculating the adaptability and a well-designed local search in previous studies, those two algorithms are able to improve their performance. The experimental results on 15 instances established a huge enhancement in terms of computation time, solution quality and stability.",

Shape-changing materials (e.g. shape memory polymers) incorporated in 3D printing have given birth to 4D printing, where 3D printed structures change in their shapes by external stimuli (temperature, light, water, etc.). The motivation of this review paper is to discuss mutual benefits from both 3D printed smart devices and 4D printed features, which can be built in a single body. It is expected that the combination of 3D printed smart devices and 4D printing would contribute to the development of high performance, adaptability to the environment and programmable 3D smart devices, which have not yet existed. This paper has reviewed the background of 3D printing, smart device fabrication using 3D printing, development into 4D printing, and future applications of 4D printing.",

Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including the decline in cardiopulmonary conditions, weaker muscle functions and a declined neuromuscular control of the movements, which result in a higher risk of fall and a higher vulnerability for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With respect to cognitive functions, senior citizens may suffer from a decline of memory function, less ability to orientate and a declined ability to cope with complex situations. This is by itself a big societal challenge with impact in multiple sectors. In this paper we present an innovative ICT solution, named eWALL, that aims to address these challenges by means of an advanced ICT infrastructure and home sensing environment; thus differentiating from existing eHealth and eCare solutions. The system of eWALL will extend the state-of-the-art of Assistive Platforms and will significantly increase the independent living of seniors.",

abstract="Nowadays, human activity recognition (HAR) is an important component of many ambient intelligent solutions where accelerometer and gyroscope signals give the information about the physical activity of an observed person. It has gained increasing attention by the availability of commercial wearable devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. Previous studies have shown that HAR can be seen as a general machine learning problem with a particular data pre-processing stage. In the last decade, several researchers measured high recognition rates on public data sets with numerous ``shallow'' machine learning techniques. In some cases artificial neural networks (ANNs) produced better performance than other shallow techniques while in other cases it was less effective. After the appearance of deep learning, a significant part of HAR researches turned toward more complex solutions such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and they claimed that CNNs can substitute the feature extraction stage in shallow techniques and can outperform them. Therefore in the current state of the art, the efficiency of ANNs against CNNs and other machine learning techniques is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of more ANN structures with different hyper-parameters and inputs on two public databases. The result will show that the two key factors in ANN design are the data-preprocessing and the hyper-parameter setup because the accuracy difference between a well and a badly parameterized ANN is huge. A well-tuned ANN with extracted features can outperform other machine learning methods in the HAR problem including CNN classifiers.",

abstract="This work sets up a research model that elaborates upon the development of continuance intention towards Mobile Travel Service System (MTSS) based on the motivational theory and the dependency theory. In the model, continuance intention is indirectly affected by personal innovativeness and e-interaction quality through the full mediation of e-engagement and perceived enjoyment. At the same time, the relationships between e-engagement and continuance intention and between perceived enjoyment and continuance intention are hypothetically moderated by e-interaction quality. The hypotheses of this work were empirically tested using data from working professionals in a technology industry regarding their use of MTSS for travel information sharing as well as booking for accommodation, airline, cars, etc. This study conducted a two-wave survey to empirically test its theoretical rationales. The findings of this work complement the previous literature by verifying the full mediating mechanism of e-engagement and perceived enjoyment and the moderating mechanism of e-interaction quality. Lastly, managerial implications for e-marketers based on this study's findings are provided.",

Urban wastes and car driving are typical actions that pollute the city. Smart city treats to reinvent cities making them a good living environment. Wireless Sensor Networks are the base technology of Smart cities. These networks are in charge to sense physical variables that could feedback the behaviour of humans. These sensors usually send data to a cloud server for applying big data technology in order to discover behaviour patterns of humans. In this way a smart city could take corrective actions in order to reduce, for example, polluted air in a critical zone. But the sensors and the backbone network that send data to that server also consume electric power. Usually the wireless backbone elements are always turned on, which could incur a high pattern of electric energy consumption. In this paper we present a new mechanism for energy saving in the wireless backbone network. Our energy saving mechanism also allows us to produce a portable wireless backbone network that could be used in several places.",

abstract="In recent years, IP (Internet Protocol)-based video surveillance has widely been useful for post-event analysis and assisting the work of privacy protection and public safety. To support high-quality IP video surveillance, error-resilience techniques are important for surveillance system design, because video has more stringent requirements than general video transmission for packet loss, latency, and jitter. The optimal FEC (forward error correction) code rate decision is a crucial procedure to determine the optimal source and channel coding rates to minimize the overall picture distortion when transporting video packets over packet loss channels. The conventional FEC code rate decision schemes using an analytical source-coding distortion model and a channel-induced distortion model are usually complex and typically employ the process of model parameter training, which involves potentially high computational complexity and implementation cost. To avoid the complex modeling procedure, we propose a simple but accurate joint source-channel distortion model to estimate the channel-loss threshold set for optimal FEC code rate decision. Since the proposed model is expressed as a simple closed form and has a small number of scene-dependent model parameters, a video sender of the surveillance system using the model can be easily implemented. For training the scene-dependent model parameters in real time, we propose a practical test-run procedure. This method accelerates the test-run while maintaining its accuracy for training the scene-dependent model parameters. Using the proposed simple model and practical test-run method, the video sender can find the optimal code rate for on-the-fly joint source-channel coding whenever there is a change in the packet-loss condition in the channel. Simulations show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the channel loss threshold set, resulting in an optimal FEC code rate with low computational complexity.",

Although the spread of digitally led urban innovations remains uneven around the world, some places have started a progressive transition towards smart city format. Two dimensions are usually highlighted among the main features of smart urban development. The reliance on the intensive use of ICT to address the most challenging issues of urban planning is emphasised from a technological perspective. On the other hand, a more holistic scenario enhances citizens' inventiveness, collective intelligence and knowledge-based urban development. The impact of ICT on urban development and representation is particularly remarkable when an entire new city is built following a smart city approach. Three relevant examples would be Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD) City in South Korea, Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Skolkovo City in Russian Federation, built to challenge the status quo of urban dynamics. Through a case study approach, this paper explores the most salient features of the place branding strategy of these new smart cities, focussed on creating an exclusive and technology-led business innovation ecosystem for highly skilled residents.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are augmented with sensing and communication technologies to support elderly people with personalized, adaptive and anticipatory requirements. A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environment's functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment. To deal with these issues, we introduce a contExt Aware web Service dEscription Language (wEASEL) that is an abstract service model to represent services and user tasks in AAL environments. Also, we present a set of wEASEL-based service matching algorithms and evaluate them for their suitability. The proposed service matchmaking mechanism can incorporate services that are available in local AAL environment as well as in the cloud computing marketplace.",

abstract="Recently, the number of surveillance video data has grown enormously since the popularity of the smart cities, which brings the difficulties to users for searching and analyzing the content of the videos. These video data are not limited to data anymore, which provide the effective information for criminal investigation systems, intrusion detection system, and many others. However, as the number of available cloud services increases, the problem of data discovery and selection arises. The semantic technology is an effective choice for enhancing the accurate of the data searching and analyzing process. In this paper, a semantic based cloud environment is proposed to facilitate the analyzing and searching process of surveillance video data. An architecture integrating ontology building, semantic annotation, and semantic search is proposed to leverage the semantic description of the video data to find them from concept-based level. A semantic intermediate layer which organizes the video data based on their semantic relations is given. Moreover, the proposed method is used in the intelligent transportation field, which shows the bright prospect of the proposed method in real applications.",

abstract="Modern societies have developed a variety of technologies and techniques to identify, measure and influence people and objects. Smart devices such as smartphones and wearables assist and track their users in every aspect of life. Large amounts of data are collected, evaluated and interconnected to analyse the behaviour of individuals, social groups and collectives. By discussing recent practices of self-tracking as well of real-time control of complex systems, we will show that real-time analysis and feedback loops increasingly foster a society of (self-)control. Data scientists and social scientists should work together to develop the concepts of regulation, which are needed to cope with the challenges and risks of big data.",

abstract="The present study sheds new light on the knowledge dimensions and processes that occur when designing new concepts and prototypes in higher education. In particular, this study aims to develop the conceptual understanding of activities and processes that help students to gain new knowledge and understanding while designing new products and services. I employed two data collection phases among undergraduate students with qualitative abductive data analyses in order to create a conceptual framework for understanding how new knowledge is created and managed in students' social interactions. This framework also enables us to distinguish the user, business, technological and methodological knowledge dimensions that constitute the elemental perspectives for design processes. This study emphasises the need for students to use diverse methods to gain new knowledge for inventing and designing new technological solutions.",

Microcavity radiation loss is controlled by engineered the cavity mode volume. Coupling loss into the waveguide is controlled by adjusting the position of the microcavity from the waveguide. We also investigated the dependence of analyte overlap integral (also called fill fraction) of the resonant mode as well as the effect of group index of the coupling waveguide at the resonant wavelength of the microcavity. In addition to the cavity properties, absorbance of the sensing medium or analyte together with the affinity constant of the probe and target biomarkers involved in the biochemical reaction also limits the minimum detection limits. We summarized our results in applications in cancer biomarker detection, heavy metal sensing and therapeutic drug monitoring.",

abstract="For the purpose of accurate diagnosis and early treatment for cancers, the classification and identification of different tumors is the key problem of computer-aided diagnosis system. In this paper, an improved semi-supervised tumor identification method is proposed, which takes advantage of the Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and offers a pathological degree tree based on ten three-dimentional (3-D) and two dimentional(2-D) tumor features. In addition, a great deal of complicated data processing is distributed in the fog computing architecture. First, we carry out the segmentation of tumors by using FRFCM algorithm, and complete the 3-D modeling. Then, the pathological shape features of 3-D and 2-D tumors are extracted from modeling, for constructing a group of feature vector. Finally, based on the landmark information of labeled samples provided by standard database and experts, we realize an improved semi-supervised FCM clustering to guide the tumor identification. The experiments are conducted by using medical CT scans of 143 patients including 452 tumors. Overall, the best average identification accuracy of                                                                   {\$}{\$}94.6{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                                                                            94.6                      {\%}                                                                     has been recorded for this proposed method, the ability of machine learning to recognize the benign, malignant and false-positive tumors is improved effectively under imbalanced data sets.",

abstract="With the advent of future generation mobile communication technologies (5G), there is the potential to allow mobile users to have access to big data processing over different clouds and networks. The increasing numbers of mobile users come with additional expectations for personalized services (e.g., social networking, smart home, health monitoring) at any time, from anywhere, and through any means of connectivity. Because of the expected massive amount of complex data generated by such services and networks from heterogeneous multiple sources, an infrastructure is required to recognize a user's sentiments (e.g., emotion) and behavioral patterns to provide a high quality mobile user experience. To this end, this paper proposes an infrastructure that combines the potential of emotion-aware big data and cloud technology towards 5G. With this proposed infrastructure, a bimodal system of big data emotion recognition is proposed, where the modalities consist of speech and face video. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves 83.10 {\%} emotion recognition accuracy using bimodal inputs. To show the suitability and validity of the proposed approach, Hadoop-based distributed processing is used to speed up the processing for heterogeneous mobile clients.",

abstract="Controlling the properties of piezoelectric thin films is a key aspect for designing highly efficient flexible electromechanical devices. In this study, the crystallographic phenomena of PbZr1--x                                Ti                  x                O3 (PZT) thin films caused by distinguished interfacial effects are deeply investigated by overlooking views, including not only an experimental demonstration but also ab initio modeling. The polymorphic phase balance and crystallinity, as well as the crystal orientation of PZT thin films at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), can be stably modulated using interfacial crystal structures. Here, interactions with MgO stabilize the PZT crystallographic system well and induce the texturing influences, while the PZT film remains quasi-stable on a conventional Al2O3 wafer. On the basis of this fundamental understanding, a high-output flexible energy harvester is developed using the controlled-PZT system, which shows significantly higher performance than the unmodified PZT generator. The voltage, current, and power densities are improved by 556{\%}, 503{\%}, and 822{\%}, respectively, in comparison with the previous flexional single-crystalline piezoelectric device. Finally, the improved flexible generator is applied to harvest tiny vibrational energy from a real traffic system, and it is used to operate a commercial electronic unit. These results clearly indicate that atomic-scale designs can produce significant impacts on macroscopic applications.",

abstract="Despite the importance of governance processes for destination management and the impact of digital technology on such processes, surprisingly little academic research has explored the use of digital technology to transform public governance in the tourism sector. This conceptual paper fills this gap by conducting a digital government stakeholder analysis for the tourism sector using the digital government evolution model as its theoretical foundation. The analysis identifies six relevant stakeholder groups: governments, businesses, non-profits, citizens, visitors and employees. It examines six types of technology-enabled interactions between government and other stakeholders: government-to-government, government-to-business, government-to-non-profit, government-to-citizen, government-to-visitor and government-to-employee. These interactions are illustrated with real-life examples. The analysis contributes to identifying pressures on tourism authorities and determining how the authorities respond to such pressures, how they innovate their operations and policies with digital technologies, and how these innovations are institutionalized over time. The results contribute to building the theoretical foundations for  sector-specific digital government and enable strategic discussion on the use of commercially viable and socially responsible digital innovation to advance the tourism sector.",

abstract="In this paper the problem of maximum lifetime routing is investigated in asynchronous duty-cycled wireless sensor networks. To model this problem, a new energy balance based asynchronous MAC protocol is proposed called K-Persistent FRTS--RCTS, which stands for K-Persistent flooding of RTS and random sending of CTS. In this protocol, each transmitter in order to send a data packet, first transmits at most K packets of RTS to its neighbors by flooding, but if the transmitter does not receive any CTS packets, it transmits the RTS packet directly to the sink. The CTS packet is sent to the transmitter either by one of the waking neighbors via a uniform random mechanism or by the sink node in response to the received RTS packet. It is shown that by using K-Persistent FRTS--RCTS MAC, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. In this problem, the optimization variables consist of the maximum number of RTS flooding requests (K) as the integer values and the flow rate of information on any route and the duty cycle of nodes both as the real values. To assess the performance of the proposed method, it is compared to the same maximum lifetime routing problem under the 1-Persistent FRTS--RCTS and the well-known X-MAC protocols. Evaluation results indicate that K-Persistent FRTS--RCTS MAC outperforms two mentioned MAC protocols in terms of both network lifetime and topology changes.",

The rest 135 images were used as test set. Further, we chose the latest powerful technique---convolutional neural network (CNN) based on convolutional layer, rectified linear unit layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and softmax layer. We also compared three different pooling techniques: max pooling, average pooling, and stochastic pooling. The results showed that our method achieved a sensitivity of 96.88{\%}, a specificity of 97.18{\%}, and an accuracy of 97.04{\%}. Our method was better than three state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, stochastic pooling performed better than other max pooling and average pooling. We validated CNN with five convolution layers and two fully connected layers performed the best.

abstract="In today's ever changing consumer driven market economy, it is imperative for providers to respond expeditiously to the changes demanded by the customer. This phenomenon is no different in the transportation sector in which a service-oriented Group Decision Support System (GDSS) provides an important role in transportation enterprise to effectively manage and rapidly respond to the varying needs of the customer. In this paper, we explore the integration problem of service-oriented system and intelligence technology through the use of a GDSS. Initially, we analyze a service-oriented architecture and then, propose the design architecture of a service-oriented GDSS. Next, we put forward a general framework that integrates the intelligent techniques as a component into the architecture of service oriented GDSS. In addition, we illustrate how Artificial Intelligence techniques can resolve the conflicts of distributed group decisions. The paper is concluded by providing a number of applications in the railway management system that demonstrates the benefits of the utilization of a service oriented intelligent GDSS.",

The proposed algorithm can decrease the communication overhead and energy consumption effectively while provide good performance in preserving privacy by the reasonable slicing based on the importance degree of the collected raw data.

abstract="Power and delay aware cloud service provisioning to mobile devices has become a promising domain today. This paper proposes and implements a cooperative offloading approach for indoor mobile cloud network. In the proposed work mobile devices register under femtolet which is a home base station with computation and data storage facilities. The resources of the mobile devices are collaborated in such a way that different mobile devices can execute different types of computations based on cooperative federation. The proposed offloading scheme is referred as cooperative code offloading in femtolet-based fog network. If none of the mobile device can execute the requested computation, then femtolet executes the computation. Use of femtolet provides the mobile devices voice call service as well as cloud service access. Femtolet is used as the fog device in our approach. The proposed model is simulated using Qualnet version 7. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme minimizes the energy by 15{\%} and average delay up to 12{\%} approximately than the existing scheme. Hence, the proposed model is referred as a low power offloading approach.",

abstract="Wireless body area network (WBANs) is composed of sensors that collect and transmit a person's physiological data to health-care providers in real-time. In order to guarantee security of this data over open networks, a secure data transmission mechanism between WBAN and application provider's servers is of necessity. Modified medical data does not provide a true reflection of an individuals state of health and its subsequent use for diagnosis could lead to an irreversible medical condition. In this paper, we propose a lightweight certificateless signcryption scheme for secure transmission of data between WBAN and servers. Our proposed scheme not only provides confidentiality of data and authentication in a single logical step, it is lightweight and resistant to key escrow attacks. We further provide security proof that our scheme provides indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack in random oracle model. Compared with two other Diffie-Hellman based signcryption schemes proposed by Barbosa and Farshim (BF) and another by Yin and Liang (YL), our scheme consumes 46 {\%} and 8 {\%} less energy during signcryption than BF and YL scheme respectively.",

Meanwhile, considering a company owned the internal BDI and the external BDI, the market demand function was revised and four decision models were proposed from a new perspective. Then, the effects of BDI investment on supply chain members' benefits under the four models were analyzed and an effectively coordination tactic was presented for achieving supply chain coordination. Results indicated when the investment cost could face a certain threshold, the retailer or the manufacturer investing in BDI could increase its benefits. Meanwhile, there existed ``positive externalities'' for other supply chain members. In addition, after supply chain members investing in BDI together, revenue-sharing contract could coordinate the supply chain effectively. This article provided a theoretical guidance or a decision basis for companies investing in BDI, meanwhile, it had reference values for supply chain coordination after investing in BDI.",

We simplify this problem as recognizing pathological brains from healthy brains. First, 12 fractional Fourier entropy (FRFE) features were extracted from each brain image. Next, we submit those features to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. Two improvements were proposed for MLP. One improvement is the pruning technique that determines the optimal hidden neuron number. We compared three pruning techniques: dynamic pruning (DP), Bayesian detection boundaries (BDB), and Kappa coefficient (KC). The other improvement is to use the adaptive real-coded biogeography-based optimization (ARCBBO) to train the biases and weights of MLP. The experiments showed that the proposed FRFE{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}KC-MLP{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}ARCBBO achieved an average accuracy of 99.53 {\%} based on 10 repetitions of K-fold cross validation, which was better than 11 recent PBDS methods.",

Recently, many research projects have employed wearable devices to detect and analyze ADLs. However, most wearable devices obstruct natural movement of the body, and the analysis of activities lacks adequate consideration of various real attributes. To tackle these issues, we proposed a two-fold solution. First, regarding unobtrusive detection of ADLs, only one small device is worn on a finger to sense and collect activity information, and identifiable features are extracted from the finger-related signals to identify various activities. Second, to reflect realistic life situations, a weighted sequence alignment approach is proposed to analyze an activity sequence detected by the device, as well as attributes of each activity in the sequence. The system is validated using 10 daily activities and 3 activity sequences. Results show 96.8 {\%} accuracy in recognizing activities and the effectiveness of sequence analysis.",

abstract="Most recent research on object tracking sensor networks has focused on collecting all data from the sensor network into the sink, which delivers the predicted locations to the corresponding nodes in order to accurately predict object movement. The communication cost of this centralized scenario is higher than that of a distributed method. Centralized data collection affects the freshness of the data and increases latency in movement trajectory prediction. In addition, due to the large amount of packets being sent and received, sensor node energy is quickly exhausted. Although this data collection method might result in higher accuracy for prediction, the sensor network lifetime is not reduced. In this paper, a distributed object tracking method is proposed using the network structure of convex polygons, called faces. The nodes in the faces cooperate to find the trajectories of an object and then these trajectories are used to predict the objects' movement. The proposed method, based on trajectory tree construction, can reduce both the storage space of collected trajectories and the time spent on trajectory prediction analysis. Simulations show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption of the nodes and make prediction of nodes moving direction accurately than the existing approaches.",

In general, Disease control strategies are only the spatial information like landscape, weather and climate, but also spatially explicit information like socioeconomic variable, population density, behavior and natural habits of the people. The spatial multi-criteria decision analysis approach combines the multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic information system (GIS) to model the spatially explicit and implicit information and to make a practical decision under different scenarios and different environment. Malaria is one of the emerging diseases worldwide; the cause of malaria is weather {\&} climate condition of the study area. The climate condition is often called as spatially implicit information, traditional decision-making models do not use the spatially implicit information it most often uses spatially explicit information such as socio-economic, natural habits of the people. There is need to develop an integrated approach that consists of spatially implicit and explicit information. The proposed approach is used to identity an effective control strategy that prevents and control of malaria. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method used in this paper to assign the weight values based on the neighborhood locations.

abstract="The emergence of Cloud Computing is revolutionizing the way we store, query, analyze and consume data, which also bring forward other development that fundamentally changed our life style. For example, Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) can improve the quality of manufacturing and many aspects in our daily life; both of them rely heavily on the cloud computing platform to develop. Central to this paradigm shift is the need to keep any common data, often held at remote outsourced locations and usually to be accessed by different authorized parties, secure from being leaked to unauthorized entities. When using the cloud services, consumer may want to encrypt sensitive data before uploading it to the cloud, but this will also eliminate the possibility to search the data efficiently in the cloud storage. A more practical solution to this is to employ a searchable encryption scheme in the cloud storage, so that user can query the encrypted data efficiently without revealing the sensitive data to the service provider. Besides the security and search features, performance of searchable encryption schemes is also very important when it comes to practical applications. In this paper, we propose several techniques to accelerate the search performance of encrypted data stored on the cloud. Notably, our techniques include massively parallel file encryption, multi-array keyword red black tree (KRBT) implementation, batched keyword search and enhanced parallel search in KRBT. To the best of our knowledge, SearchaStore is the first work that attempts to accelerate searchable encryption using GPU technology.",

abstract="Load balancing and energy conservation techniques are one of the significant constraints in the design of in software defined wireless sensor network (SD-WSN). Usually, clustering method helps the network in the minimum utilization of energy that results in enhancing network lifetime. Moreover, various nodes in the multi-hop network that are near to the base station drain their battery very quickly thus lead to creating hot spot problem in a network. To overcome such constraints, this paper proposes a multilayer clustering architecture for selection of forwarding node, rotation of cluster head, and inter and intra-cluster routing communication. The proposed scheme efficiently tackle the rotation of forwarder node by incorporating routing table (table list) at each node. Moreover, the rotation is performed by the consideration of two threshold levels of the residual energy of a node. Also, the exploitation of decision maker node, forwarder node, backup forwarder node, and non-forwarder node enhancing the routing strategy in a network. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested and evaluated by C programming language. The results show that the proposed scheme successful achieve better results than TLPER and EADUC in energy consumption per node, end-to-end communication, hop count in cluster formation.",

title="EETP-MAC: energy efficient traffic prioritization for medium access control in wireless body area networks",
journal="Telecommunication Systems",
year="2017",
month="Jun",

abstract="Wireless body area network (WBAN) has witnessed significant attentions in the healthcare domain using biomedical sensor-based monitoring of heterogeneous nature of vital signs of a patient's body. The design of frequency band, MAC superframe structure, and slots allocation to the heterogeneous nature of the patient's packets have become the challenging problems in WBAN due to the diverse QoS requirements. In this context, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Traffic Prioritization for Medium Access Control (EETP-MAC) protocol, which provides sufficient slots with higher bandwidth and guard bands to avoid channels interference causing longer delay. Specifically, the design of EETP-MAC is broadly divided in to four folds. Firstly, patient data traffic prioritization is presented with broad categorization including Non-Constrained Data (NCD), Delay-Constrained Data (DCD), Reliability-Constrained Data (RCD) and Critical Data (CD). Secondly, a modified superframe structure design is proposed for effectively handling the traffic prioritization. Thirdly, threshold based slot allocation technique is developed to reduce contention by effectively quantifying criticality on patient data. Forth, an energy efficient frame design is presented focusing on beacon interval, superframe duration, and packet size and inactive period. Simulations are performed to comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed EETP-MAC with the state-of-the-art MAC protocols. The comparative evaluation attests the benefit of EETP-MAC in terms of efficient slot allocation resulting in lower delay and energy consumption.",

abstract="In regards to information technology of modern society, IT convergence technology is applied in various fields. Particularly, active studies are conducted for creative design products with the use of IT convergence technology in design industry which transforms sensibility of people into various expressions. People started to put high significance to design elements and sensibility accordingly with diverse and distinctive lifestyle and active studies are also conducted on sensibility engineering interaction method which connects sensibility of people with design to satisfy such demand. Also, since distributed processing became available, advancement from server centered information processing and network, such strength is applied to design industry as well. The purpose of this study lies in recommending and proposing P2P context awareness based sensibility design using color and bio-signal analysis. In order to express design that coincides with distinctive and differentiated sensibility of people, the proposed method analyzes relation between visual sensibility and color design with the use of statistic analysis tool R 3.1.0 and SPSS 21.0 and the clustering of users with similar sensibility is conducted with the use of P2P network based context awareness. It recommends color design that coincides with the sensibility of new user by using the P2P network based collaborative filtering and applying it to color design based on clustered users. Proposed method reduces the time and cost spent to estimate design that satisfies the sensibility and requirement of user and supports companies to have concrete and clarified grasp on ambiguous personal requirement of user.",

The traffic source of each wireless body area network is parameterized using the traffic specification, and required service rate for each wireless body area networks can be derived. The prioritized resource allocation algorithm employs this information to allocate the channel resource based on the wireless body area networks' service priority.

Data generated by a BAN can be processed in real-time by the BAN coordinator and/or transmitted to a server-side for online/offline processing and long-term storing. A network of BANs worn by a community of people produces large amount of contextual data that require a scalable and efficient approach for elaboration and storage. Cloud computing can provide a flexible storage and processing infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis of body sensor data streams. In this paper, we motivate the introduction of Cloud-assisted BANs along with the main challenges that need to be addressed for their development and management. The current state-of-the-art is overviewed and framed according to the main requirements for effective Cloud-assisted BAN architectures.

Using the case of a global consultancy firm, the paper explains KM software-organization incongruences as the consequence of differences between organizational and KM software developer's knowledge work context and practice. Such differences reflect the differing `situated' knowledge work practices that KM software developers and adopting organizations deliberately acquire and evolve over time. Theoretically, this paper gives a more comprehensive account of how knowledge work practices emerged and were then embedded into the software or the organization.

abstract="Accurate categorization of cirrhosis liver image in ultrasound modality is of great importance in medical diagnosis and treatment. Health informatics is important as it provides quick predictions on diseases based on nearness of symptoms. Modelling solutions for the same on cloud using deep learning is the motivation of this paper. Here, we propose a deep learning model associated with correlation based feature selection method for cirrhosis image classification. We compare the results with three other conventional classifiers algorithms to improve the better classification accuracy. First in pre-processing stage, noises are eliminated from pathological scan images by using modified laplacian pyramid non-linear diffusion filter. From the pre-processed scan images, each cirrhosis region is obtained under the guidance of radiology or physicians. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch by gray level, local binary pattern and scale invariant feature, a feature selection technique is applied to choice the predominant texture features for each classifier. Finally a convolution neural network is implemented to improve the performance of classifiers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Convolution neural network algorithm with two hidden layers gives more accuracy in classifying cirrhosis image with 98{\%} sensitivity. Experiments are carried out with 990 cirrhosis image patches which demonstrates that our proposed deep learning classifier perform 100{\%} well than original classifiers in terms of accuracy.",

abstract="Sustaining independent living for elderly people in their own homes is desirable for various reasons. As older people become frail or disabled, a `gap' appears between the abilities they still have and the abilities that are required for independent living. To a certain extent robots may close this gap by providing functionality lost through frailty or disability. A scenario was created involving a re-enablement coach robot. This scenario was discussed with older people, informal carers, and care professionals in focus groups in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and France. The results provided insights into the acceptability of robots and showed that older people were open to the idea of having a robot supporting them in their daily life. Participants were also willing to have a robot perform higher level coordinating tasks while playing the role of the re-enablement coach. However, participants wanted the robot to operate at the same level of intelligence as a human carer. This implies that more attention needs to be given to the development of the social skills and behaviour of such robots. Additionally, participants acknowledged that such a robot would create tension between respecting the autonomy of the user (i.e. robot obeys all commands given by the user) and the promotion of independence in the long term (i.e. robot is programmed to maintain the abilities the user still has). Our results indicate that people preferred to resolve this tension in favour of autonomy. This choice, however, may decrease the user's abilities in the longer term and thereby undermine users' ability to live independently.",

abstract="There has been significant interest in the use of HTTP adaptive streaming for live or on-demand video over the Internet in recent years. To mitigate the streaming transmission delay and reduce the networking overhead, an effective and critical approach is to utilize cache services between the origin servers and the heterogeneous clients. As the underlying protocol for web transactions, HTTP has great potentials to explore the resources within state-of-the-art CDNs for caching; yet distinct challenges arise in the HTTP adaptive streaming context. After examining a long-term and large-scale adaptive streaming dataset as well as statistical analysis, we demonstrate that the switching requests among the different qualities frequently emerge and constitute a significant portion in a per-day view. Consequently, they have substantially affected the performance of cache servers and Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of viewers. In this paper, we propose a novel cache model that captures the dependency among the segments in the cache server for adaptive HTTP streaming. Our work does not assume any specific selection algorithm on the client's side and hence can be easily incorporated into existing streaming cache systems. Its centralized nature is also well accommodated by the latest DASH specification. Moreover, we extend our work to the multi-server caching context and present a similarity-aware allocation mechanism to enhance the caching efficiency. The performance evaluation shows our dependency- and similarity-aware strategy can significantly improve the cache hit-ratio and QoE of HTTP streaming as compared to previous approaches.",

pages="2683--2711",
abstract="Congestion in Wireless Sensor Networks is one of the primary causes of performance degradation due to severe packet loss leading to excessive energy consumption. Normally, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network gets fragmented. To mitigate this issue, we propose a three phase energy balanced zone based routing protocol. Specifically, in the first phase the region is physically divided into equi-sized zones. In the second phase, a node with minimum traffic and minimum distance from other nodes inside each zone is selected as the zone leader. This leader is responsible for delivering data generated by any node in that zone and for routing and forwarding the data received from other zone leaders of the neighbor zones. In the third phase, zones are categorized as non-congested, medium-congested and congested zones and route path is established in inter and intra zones. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the zone congestion levels along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed both at inter and intra zone levels in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 10.5{\%} enhancement in the network throughput, 19.5{\%} energy saving when compared with grid-based multi-path GMCAR with congestion avoidance and 23.03{\%} energy saving when compared with priority-based application-specific congestion control clustering protocol PASCC.",

abstract="The outstanding advances of mobile devices stimulate their wide usage. Since mobile devices are coupled with third-party applications, lots of security and privacy problems are induced. However, current mobile malware detection and analysis technologies are still imperfect, ineffective, and incomprehensive. Due to the specific characteristics of mobile devices such as limited resources, constant network connectivity, user activities and location sensing, and local communication capability, mobile malware detection faces new challenges, especially on dynamic runtime malware detection. Many intrusions or attacks could happen after a mobile app is installed or executed. The literature still expects practical and effective dynamic malware detection approaches. In this paper, we give a thorough survey on dynamic mobile malware detection. We first introduce the definition, evolution, classification, and security threats of mobile malware. Then, we summarize a number of criteria and performance evaluation measures of mobile malware detection. Furthermore, we compare, analyze, and comment on existing mobile malware detection methods proposed in recent years based on evaluation criteria and measures. Finally, we figure out open issues in this research field and motivate future research directions.",

abstract="Remote rendering is a well-known solution to the issue of running high-performance applications requiring complex visualizations on less capable hardware/software platforms or when client access to the data source for visualization is undesired or prohibitive in terms of required bandwidth. Visualizing the output of these remote rendering applications is typically achieved through native applications or, when considering a browser environment, through plug-ins. In this paper, several solutions are presented that enable deployment of these applications on standard web browsers, even those from the pre-HTML5 era. The focus in this paper is on two specific use case scenarios, taking into account that the proposed solutions are generic enough to be applied to a range of similar applications. The technologies presented cover the entire range of sub-processes contained in a complete remote rendering solution, such as the establishment of interaction feedback channels and delivery of images as part of the rendering pipeline. Depending on factors such as application requirements, developer preferences, feature availability in the web browser or raw performance figures, a custom solution can be composed from the options discussed in this paper. This is illustrated by applying them to the two aforementioned use cases, each with specific requirements and challenges, and benchmarking these example setups in terms of performance. A comparison of advantages and disadvantages is presented to guide developers in applying the technologies under real-life conditions.",

Emotion-aware mobile computing utilizes mobile and computing technology to detect the affective state of a person. It is a new active research area and will bring many attractive applications and services with the development of 5G. Emotion-aware mobile computing has two main veins: analysis and computation. With the support of big data and cloud computing technology, mobile users are able to obtain better performance in terms of resource intensive service. The whole process of emotion-aware mobile computing requires data collection, data transmission, data analysis, data cognition, and emotion-aware action feedback. In order to detect the accurate emotion, massive data are required to be processed in each step. Therefore, the energy consumption is not an ignorable issue in this technology. In this paper, a framework of energy efficient emotion-aware mobile computing system is proposed. It considers the energy saving from both local user part and remote data centers part. In the local user part, the energy efficient data transmission approach is introduced while in the remote data centers part, the renewable energy based geo-distributed data centers are considered. The results from the analysis demonstrate that the proposed framework is useful to provide energy saving while keeping quality of service (QoS).",

This survey article provides an overview of the recent investigations where both vision and inertial sensors are used together and simultaneously to perform human action recognition more effectively. The thrust of this survey is on the utilization of depth cameras and inertial sensors as these two types of sensors are cost-effective, commercially available, and more significantly they both provide 3D human action data.

In this paper, we consider the problem of calculating multiple itineraries for MAs to visit source nodes in parallel. Our algorithm iteratively partitions a directional sector zone where the source nodes are included in an itinerary. The length of an itinerary is controlled by the angle of the directional sector zone in such a way that near-optimal routes for MAs can be obtained by selecting the angle efficiently in an adaptive fashion.

Experimental results demonstrate that the approach can detect various types of falls efficiently (i.e., in real-time within a smart phone processor) and also correctly (95 {\%} and 93 {\%} true positives for falls ending with `lying' and `sit-tilted' respectively). The approach is reliable for different subjects and different situations, since it is not only based on empirical thresholds and subject-based training models, but in addition it is underpinned by theory.",

abstract="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia, which mostly affects elderly people. Gradual loss in memory and declining cognitive functions are core symptoms associated with AD. Conventional brain images do not provide sufficient information to diagnose AD at an early stage. To delay the progression of memory impairment, there is a dire need to develop systems capable of early AD diagnosis. This paper describes a proposed fuzzy method for inferring the risk of dementia using the brain cortical thickness and hippocampus thickness. The aim is to develop a reliable index that allows the evaluation of brain health. The dementia index poses potential to become a biologically based biomarker for the clinical assessment of patient's dementia. Results show that the inference value of patient with mild cognitive impairment is significantly higher than that of healthy (control) or schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Our results suggest that a higher inference value indicates that the patient is at higher risk and is more likely to eventually progress to AD. The system is also tested with age-associated memory impairment patients. The results confirm that our model is able to distinguish between these four patient groups.",

abstract="Recent advancements in wireless communication have made it possible to use low-power invasive or non-invasive sensor nodes to remotely monitor patients through wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, reliable and secure data transmission in WBANs is a challenging task. The issues such as privacy and confidentiality of patient related data require the reliable and secure data routing so that data can be kept safe from the malicious nodes. On the other hand, conventional biometric and cryptographic algorithms cannot be used in WBANs as they are, most of the time, complex and do not consider the misbehaving nature of nodes. Moreover, wireless nature of in vivo biomedical sensor nodes produces electromagnetic radiations which result in increased temperature; that could be harmful particularly for sensitive tissues. Therefore, trust and temperature based lightweight and resource efficient solutions are ultimate pre-requisite for WBAN. In this paper, we propose a trust and thermal-aware routing protocol for WBANs that considers trust among and temperature of nodes to isolate misbehaving nodes. This multi-facet routing strategy helps in providing a trusted and balanced network environment and restricts hotspot/misbehaving nodes to be part of trusted routes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol performs better in terms of packet drop ratio, packet delay, throughput and temperature under varying traffic conditions as compared other state-of-art schemes.",

abstract="Nodes in wireless sensor networks are highly resource constrained and topology of such networks remains highly dynamic due to sudden death of sensor nodes and break of links. When mobility to such nodes is introduced, it gives rise to a highly complex network system since the topology becomes even more dynamic. Providing security in the routing layer of wireless sensor network is a highly critical issue mainly due to the stringent resource constraints and dynamic topology. In this paper, we propose a Secure Hierarchical and Role based Routing Protocol for Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (SHaRP) which is a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic approach. In the SHaRP framework, the sensor field is divided into some logical clusters and each cluster contains nodes with different roles such as ordinary sensor node (OSN), cluster head (CH) and gateway node (GN). Different keys are used by the nodes with distinct roles for message encryption and message decryption. The overall security has been entrusted on different roles in a distributed manner instead of relying on one authority and that is why this approach is safe from single point of failure problem. This also enhances the security in the network system. In this paper, we focus more on various security aspects in the routing process rather than the issues like cluster formation and role distribution. We shift most of the computing overhead to the base station as it is assumed to be a resourceful and reliable node. This obviously improves the energy efficiency of the protocol. We also report a security analysis along with implementation issues of the proposed protocol.",

abstract="One of the most critical and challenging issues when developing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is how to extend the network lifetime. Sensors are energy-constrained devices that require developing minimization techniques and mechanisms in order to exploit perfectly the energy and to prolong as long as possible the overall network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a limited energy consumption model for P2P wireless sensor networks, which takes a benefit of the Chord assets and adapts this last one so that it will be suitable for P2P WSNs. Chord in its basic form optimizes the path length by minimizing the number of hops, but it does not optimize the energy, since it was designed for wired networks. The key idea of our proposal is to optimize both the number of hops and the energy consumption to provide an energy-efficient routing scheme for P2P WSNs. The proposed enhanced Chord scheme makes a use of only Cluster-Heads (with the strongest level of energy) to construct the ring, which reduces the Chord topology while preserving the network connectivity. In the enhanced Chord scheme, Cluster-Heads are elected automatically and dynamically over the time, which helps to extend the network longevity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme proves good performances in terms of hops number, alive nodes over the time and energy efficiency.",

abstract="Congestion in wireless sensor networks degrades the quality of the channel and network throughput. This leads to packet loss and energy dissipation. To cope with this problem, a two-stage cognitive network congestion control approach is presented in this paper. In the first stage of the proposed strategy, initially downstream nodes calculate their buffer occupancy ratio and estimate congestion degree in the MAC layer. Then, they send the estimated value to both network and transport layers of their upstream nodes. The network layer of the upstream node uses TOPSIS in order to rank all neighbors to select the best one as the next relay node. In the second stage, transport layer of the given node adjusts the transmission rate using an optimized regression analysis by RSM. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed method not only decreases packet loss, but also significantly improves throughput and energy efficiency under different traffic conditions, especially in heavy traffic areas. Also, Tukey test is used to compare performance of algorithms as well as to demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly better than other methods.",

abstract="In wireless sensor deployments, network layer multicast can be used to improve the bandwidth and energy efficiency for a variety of applications, such as service discovery or network management. However, despite efforts to adopt IPv6 in networks of constrained devices, multicast has been somewhat overlooked. The Multicast Forwarding Using Trickle (Trickle Multicast) internet draft is one of the most noteworthy efforts. The specification of the IPv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) also attempts to address the area but leaves many questions unanswered. In this paper we highlight our concerns about both these approaches. Subsequently, we present our alternative mechanism, called stateless multicast RPL forwarding algorithm (SMRF), which addresses the aforementioned drawbacks. Having extended the TCP/IP engine of the Contiki embedded operating system to support both trickle multicast (TM) and SMRF, we present an in-depth comparison, backed by simulated evaluation as well as by experiments conducted on a multi-hop hardware testbed. Results demonstrate that SMRF achieves significant delay and energy efficiency improvements at the cost of a small increase in packet loss. The outcome of our hardware experiments show that simulation results were realistic. Lastly, we evaluate both algorithms in terms of code size and memory requirements, highlighting SMRF's low implementation complexity. Both implementations have been made available to the community for adoption.",

For such an evaluation, users should regularly send microscopic images of their skin to a server using their smartphone. Meanwhile, the server collects the user postings from their SNS and analyzes them to identify activities that might have an influence on their skin. Finally, the server provides the user with a report containing a comparison of their past and current skin conditions, a statistical summary of their occasional events collected from their SNS, and a set of advices for improving their skin condition including skin care products.

As an approach, this study outlines a general framework based on human (or consumer) contexts for the discovery and creation of business intelligence. Three major portions are discussed. First, the collection of human contexts, including activity logs in both cyber and physical worlds, is modeled. Second, data analysis was performed via proposed mining algorithms that concern potential fusion at different levels according to situations and ultimate purposes. Third, sustenance of developed model is then concentrated. An open platform was developed to support the evolutionary process of human models, and to allow contributions (e.g., data sharing, accessing, etc.) from third parties.",

abstract="Delay jitter, which can affect the performance of controlled physical system and result in system instability, is an important issue for supporting instantaneity in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to guarantee continuous, real-time and dependable operation. Thus, it is significant to establish an algorithm to smoothing the delay jitter. In this paper, first, we compare several delay jitter smoothing algorithms, discuss their merits and demerits, and then propose one new algorithm over the existing algorithms, called derivative least square (DLS), which can eliminates the reverse way delay variation spikes. Second, we address the problem of most delay jitter smoothing schemes, namely they used uniformly distributed random numbers to simulate network delay data, which deviates from real network delay. To demonstrate the validity and reliability of DLS, except uniform distribution, Pareto distribution, of which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is more close to the CDF of real network delay, is applied to conduct the experiment. The experimental results show that compared with the other three existing algorithms, DLS can be more effective and reliable in predicting the play-back delay.",

Load balanced clustering effectively organize the network into a connected hierarchy. Clustering is a discrete problem that can have more than one solution under different operating constraints. In this scenario, meta-heuristic algorithms are found suitable because they give set of solutions in acceptable time constraints. In the literature, several analytical and meta-heuristic approaches have been developed for load balanced clustering. In this paper, a novel harmony search based energy efficient load balanced clustering algorithm is presented and it is tested on a large sample network. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach has faster convergence and gives reliable and efficient load balanced clustering as compared to conventional harmony search algorithm (HSA) and several other methods in the literature. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed approach is also verified for different cases of fixed and variable parameters of HSA.",

The analyzed MAC protocol is slotted Aloha which is used in the contention based mode of the IEEE 802.15.6 std. using IR-UWB PHY.

In our scheme, a target access structure is embedded into ciphertexts, while user's private key corresponds an attribute set. Only the two are matched can a receiver decrypt the ciphertexts and verify whether it is from valid data signer. We introduce key insulation mechanism into our scheme by dividing the system lifetime into several time periods. When key exposure happens, the system will evolve into the next time period to preserve the forward security. We eliminate bilinear parings in our KI-CP-ABSC thus the computation burden on the terminal devices are reduced sharply. The high efficiency and proved security make our KI-CP-ABSC a promising tool for secure data sharing in wireless environments.",

abstract="Lifetime enhancement has been the major constraint of developing wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Most of previous related works separately considered dynamics and heterogeneity of WSNs, and did not consider energy-harvesting (EH) sensors, which can absorb natural power (e.g., solar and wind power) to extend lifetime of sensor devices. Therefore, this work investigates the problem of extending the lifetime of dynamic heterogeneous WSNs with EH sensors to enhancing the total WSN lifetime. This problem can be characterized as finding the maximal number of covers each of which is a part of all sensors so that all targets can be monitored by these sensors. Since the case for static WSNs has been shown to be NP-complete, the concerned problem is also NP-complete. Hence, this work first models this problem mathematically, and then proposes a novel harmony search algorithm with multiple populations and local search (HSAML) for this problem with dynamics, heterogeneity, and EH sensors. By simulation, the network lifetime, stability, and executing time of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. From experimental results, the proposed HSAML performs better than the conventional algorithm in terms of average network lifetime for larger-scale problems (i.e., when the number of common and EH sensors is small). In addition, the results confirm that adding EH sensors really helps extend the total WSN lifetime.",

The method first obtains a proper initial threshold based on Bayes decision theory to ensure accurate initial segmentation, and then an adaptation mechanism is designed to automatically adjust the threshold to improve user-dependent accuracy. A dataset of over 1,200 samples from 12 gestures and 25 subjects is created for evaluation.

abstract="Video frame manipulation has become commonplace with the growing easy access to powerful computing abilities. One of the most common types of video frame tampers is the copy-paste tamper, wherein a region from a video frame is replaced with another region from the same frame. In order to improve the robustness of passive video tampering detection, we propose a content-based video similarity tamper passive blind detection algorithm based on multi-scale normalized mutual information which can implement video frame copy, frame insertion and frame deletion tamper detection. The detail implementation of the proposed algorithm consists of multi-scale content analysis, single-scale content similarity measure, multi-scale content similarity measure, and tampering positioning. Firstly, we get the scales of the visual content of the video frame using Gaussian pyramid transform; Secondly, to measure the similarity of single-scale visual content, we define adjacent normalized mutual information of two frames according to information theory; Thirdly, we construct the multi-scale normalized mutual information descriptors to achieve the multi-scale visual content similarity measure of adjacent two frames using a linear combination. Finally, we use the local outlier isolated factor detection algorithm to detect the position of the video tampering. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only detect the video frame tampering position of delete, copy, and insert effectively, but also can detect the tampering of different and homology video encoding formats. We obtain a feature detecting accuracy in excess of 93{\%} and detection rate of 96{\%} across post processing operations, and are able to detect the delete, copy, and insert regions with a high true positive rate and lower false positive rate than the existing time field tamper detection methods.",

abstract="Understanding crowd behavior using automated video analytics is a relevant research problem in recent times due to complex challenges in monitoring large gatherings. From an automated video surveillance perspective, estimation of crowd density in particular regions of the video scene is an indispensable tool in understanding crowd behavior. Crowd density estimation provides the measure of number of people in a given region at a specified time. While most of the existing computer vision methods use supervised training to arrive at density estimates, we propose an approach to estimate crowd density using motion cues and hierarchical clustering. The proposed method incorporates optical flow for motion estimation, contour analysis for crowd silhouette detection, and clustering to derive the crowd density. The proposed approach has been tested on a dataset collected at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and two publicly available crowd datasets---Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance (PETS) 2009 and University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Pedestrian Traffic Database---with different crowd densities (medium- to high-density crowds) and in varied environmental conditions (in the presence of partial occlusions).

abstract="This paper explores the question of how foresight and futures research can identify and address ethical issues in the field of Information Systems (IS). Starting from the premise that such IS are part of socio-technical systems, the interaction between technology and human actors raise ethical concerns. Early recognition of these concerns can address ethical issues and improve the use of the technology for a range of social and organisational goals. This paper discusses research conducted in two futures research projects. Both projects investigated emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) and ethics. The first project established approaches for identifying future technologies and their related ethical concerns. This led to the identification of 11 emerging ICTs and their associated ethical concerns. The second project took these general ethical concerns and focused on their role in IS. Specifically, how IS professionals view future emerging technologies, their associated ethical concerns, and how they think these concerns could be addressed. The key findings are that IS professionals are primarily interested in the job at hand and less so in the ethical concerns that the job might bring; ethics is a concern that is best left for others to deal with. This paper considers the implications of research on ethics in emerging ICTs and draws general conclusions about the relevance of future technologies research in IS.",

abstract="In the modern society, the forms of disasters are getting larger and more diverse by abnormal weather phenomena due to rapid social changes. As human and economic damage is increasing by these disasters, interest in disaster observation and prevention is increasing and studies have been carried out in various fields. In order to minimize disaster damage, National Disaster Information Center provides disaster-related information such as disaster situations, risk index, local situation and so on. At present, however, various descriptive studies on action tips in the event of a disaster, disaster alert, disaster communications network have been in progress but there are few studies on prediction or simulation for preventing disasters etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a slope-based intelligent 3D disaster simulation using a physics engine. The proposed method is to infer a variety of disaster situations that may occur in reality through ontology and apply it to 3D simulation. Disaster situation ontology constitutes context information of outside, inside, disasters etc. and generates rule bases using Jena 2.0 inference engine. Inference results are derived in the form of XML and applicable to a variety of devices. The expression of 3D simulation virtual space is divided into interior and exterior. Interior constitutes the index information based on actually measured terrain and then expresses it into 3D compound type terrain data. Exterior expresses six planes into a hexahedron by using Sky Box technique. Simulation operates object collision, movement, surroundings etc. in real time by using a physics engine and represents a disaster situation in 3D virtual space by using particles function. Based on ontology based context awareness, environment context information on slope, including landslides, snow, rain, fogs, fire, explosion, and smoke, is developed into the slope based intelligent 3D disaster simulation. As a result, depending on geomorphic characteristics, disaster management service can realistically and visually be offered to users in 3D virtual reality. In addition, it is possible to experimentally apply disaster situations virtually through 3D virtual reality, and thereby judge their potential risk.",

The macroblocks are positioned in the field of view (FOV) of camera where the probability of occurrence of object is high. After placing macroblocks, a threshold value is examined to detect the presence of objects in the selected macroblocks. Afterwards, a quadtree approach is used to minimize the bounding box and to reduce the pixelation.

To configure these services for the desired user devices, a suitable configuration algorithm is needed. Therefore, this paper describes a QoS-adaptive service configuration approach to choose the optimal configuration for the preferred user devices in varied contexts so that the user can access the services ubiquitously.

abstract="Nowadays, complex smartphone applications are developed that support gaming, navigation, video editing, augmented reality, and speech recognition which require considerable computational power and battery lifetime. The cloud computing provides a brand new opportunity for the development of mobile applications. Mobile Hosts (MHs) are provided with data storage and processing services on a cloud computing platform rather than on the MHs. To provide seamless connection and reliable cloud service, we are focused on communication. When the connection to cloud server is increased explosively, each MH connection quality has to be declined. It causes several problems: network delay, retransmission, and so on. In this paper, we propose proxy based architecture to improve link performance for each MH in mobile cloud computing. By proposed proxy, the MH need not keep connection of the cloud server because it just connected one of proxy in the same subnet. And we propose the optimal access network discovery algorithm to optimize bandwidth usage. When the MH changes its point of attachment, proposed discovery algorithm helps to connect the optimal access network for cloud service. By experiment result and analysis, the proposed connection management method has better performance than the 802.11 access method.",

abstract="An automated plant biometric system is now an important step in preserving nature's biodiversity. This paper presents a novel Relative Sub-image Sparse Coefficient (RSSC) algorithm for mobile devices (MDs) representing plant leaves into a mathematically compact vector for its classification. The RSSC feature vector includes local Statistical Entropy Texture (SET) information inter-related to all the sub-images within a leaf. RSSC space is merged with Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature to refine the outputs using best-Nearest Neighbor (best-NN), designed for MDs. The experiments were performed on three different types of leaf datasets: (i) Flavia, (ii) ICL and (iii) Diseased leaf datasets. The results proves our method more accurate and better compared to other existing plant identification systems. The proposed approach is also tolerant under shape distortion caused while capturing. The mobile machine learning system for leaf image informatics is deployed on Android devices which helps botanists, agriculturists and medical biologists to recognize ubiquitously the herbs and plant species anywhere-anytime.",

abstract="Recommending similar-interest users' groups in multimedia services is the problem of detecting for each registered user his/her membership to one interest-group of relevant consumers. The consumers in each interest-group share some relevant preferences which guarantee that the interest-group as a whole satisfies some desired properties of similarity. As a result, forming these interest-groups requires the availability of personal data of different consumers. This is a crucial requirement for different recommender systems. With the increasing trend of service providers to collect a large volume of personal data regarding their end-users, presumably to better serve them. However, a significant part of the data that is typically collected is not essential to the service being offered, or to the completion of the services it was presumably released for. Gathering such unnecessary data can be seen as a privacy threat, and storing it exposes the end-users to further unavoidable risks. In this paper, a privacy aware group based recommender system is proposed for the automated discovery of appropriate interest groups in multimedia services. A fog based middleware (FMCP) was introduced that runs at end-users' sides and allows exchanging of their information to facilities recommending and creating interest-groups without disclosing their real preferences to other consumers. The membership of consumers in various interest groups allows receiving highly appropriate and reliable multimedia content-related advices. The system utilizes two protocols to attain this goal. Experiments were performed on real dataset.",

abstract="The forest fire occurs every year and brings huge losses to human life and property. How to predict the trend of forest fire accurately for commanders to make decisions in a very short period of time, has become a hot issue of research in recent years. In many cases, temporal and spatial variation of wind direction and wind speed become the main factors in affecting the spread of forest fire. Research on local wind field in micro scale is helpful to improve the accuracy of the prediction of forest fire spreading, but in reality, the data provided by meteorological department are large scale wind field data. Micro scale of the local wind field data mostly rely on the speculation based on the experience of people. So the system which can transform the large scale wind field data to the micro scale local wind field data to improve the prediction accuracy of forest fire spreading is especially necessary. In this paper, according to the characteristics of the near surface wind field we calculate the wind speed by the wind profile, get differential of wind direction of each grid position through the diagnosis of the wind field model, so as to realize the finer micro scale wind field in the complex topography. Wind field and forest fire model can be displayed in real time visualization platform. In the final of this paper, we selected multiple fire cases contained with the southern typical fire cases which have the complete data as the research object to analyze, and have implemented the simulation of forest fire inversion in the self-developed software FFSimulator v1. 0. The simulation of local wind field, fixed wind field and the no wind field forest fire are conducted under the conditions of the same terrain and the same combustible material. With the comparison of simulation results and the case study of forest fire burning area and spread edges, the experimental results show that the simulation using local wind field data of forest fire is more accurate in forecasting the trend of fire spreading, and can provide more favorable reference for making fire prevention and fire fighting decisions and transportation planning in forest.",

abstract="Recommender systems have been one of the most prominent information filtering techniques during the past decade. However, they suffer from two major problems, which degrade the accuracy of suggestions: data sparsity and cold start. The popularity of social networks shed light on a new generation of such systems, which is called social recommender system. These systems act promisingly in solving data sparsity and cold start issues. Given that social relationships are not available to every system, the implicit relationship between the items can be an adequate option to replace the constraints. In this paper, we explored the effect of combining the implicit relationships of the items and user-item matrix on the accuracy of recommendations. The new Item Asymmetric Correlation (IAC) method detects the implicit relationship between each pair of items by considering an asymmetric correlation among them. Two dataset types, the output of IAC and user-item matrix, are fused into a collaborative filtering recommender via Matrix Factorization (MF) technique. We apply the two mostly used mapping models in MF, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Alternating Least Square, to investigate their performances in the presence of sparse data. The experimental results of real datasets at four levels of sparsity demonstrate the better performance of our method comparing to the other commonly used approaches, especially in handling the sparse data.",

The proposed technique is based on the use of directional motion history images (DMHIs), which is an extension of the popular optical-flow method for object tracking. Zernike moments of each DMHI are computed in order to perform the classification. The technique incorporates automatic temporal segmentation of isolated utterances. The segmentation of isolated utterance is achieved using pair-wise pixel comparison. Support vector machine is used for classification and the results are based on leave-one-out paradigm. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves better performance in visemes recognition than others reported in literature. The benefit of this proposed visual speech recognition method is that it is suitable for real-time applications due to quick motion tracking system and the fast classification method employed. It has applications in command and control using lip movement to text conversion and can be used in noisy environment and also for assisting speech impaired persons.",

Using many replications of a relatively small number of the most popular items a significant performance improvement can be achieved. Our method was verified using real video streaming data taken from traces of live content distribution networks. Simulation results show that replicating a relatively small number of video files can significantly reduce the incoming bandwidth from the Internet backbone, as well as the (time) latency for content delivery. The proposed scheme is particularly suitable for IP-based TV services, for which the content popularity can be very often predicted with relatively high accuracy. In addition, we propose a hybrid cache management scheme, in which the cache is partitioned into two components. The first component is for long-term items, and it is updated relatively rarely, while the second component is updated more frequently.",

abstract="This study suggests to use popularity based caching for IP-based TV (IPTV) services over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Each peer in a P2P network can use two levels of cache hierarchy: an internal cache and a neighboring peer cache. Using this property, our main focus is on caching the globally most popular video files nearby the clients, in order to reduce the IPTV service delay, increase the quality of service provided to the clients, and reduce the traffic over the Internet backbone. The proposed framework was applied on real data traces from live P2P networks. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the Least Recently Used (LRU) and the Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache management schemes. This study is motivated by the vision of large P2P networks consisting of many volunteers serving as peers, each of which has a relatively small cache size, in terms of the number of video items it can store. Since the performance of both the LRU and LFU schemes is very poor for small cache, there is a need for another cache management scheme, which outperforms these schemes, especially for small cache size. The proposed distributed popularity-based caching scheme can significantly increase the performance of P2P networks used for video streaming, with respect to the existing networks, that use the LRU or LFU schemes. The performance metric used for comparison is the cache hit ratio and the expected delay for content delivery. In both parameters a significant improvement is demonstrated.",

The majority of the existing signals detection and classification methods presume that the received signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The performance of the modulation classification algorithms degrades severely under the non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a robust algorithm to identify the modulation type of digital signal contaminated with non-Gaussian impulse noise and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) using a sparse signal decomposition on hybrid dictionary. The algorithm first detects and removes the impulse noise using sparse signal decomposition thereafter it classifies the modulation schemes using cyclostationary feature extraction algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method under different non-Gaussian impulse noise and AWGN conditions. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated using well known classifiers available in the literature.",

In such a system, images are expressed based on visual content characteristics, and similarities between images are obtained by comparing the features. A pathology image is usually very huge and expressed as several layer of image quality called OpenSlide. To find similar cells from a OpenSlide file, we have to use high performance computer equiped with multi-core and large size memory. In this paper, we propose a method to find similar cell images with resource limited computer. For this purpose, we exploit several technique to minimize system resource requirement and adapt imaging process scheme that enhances the accuracy of finding similar cell images from a OpenSlide file. We adapt a leveling, tiling and sub tiling to the OpenSlide file and extracting the feature points accurately using the hybrid feature extracting algorithm that adapts advantages of ORB and Blob algorithm. Furthermore, grayscale and histogram schemes are used to improve the accuracy of finding similar pathology cell images. Experiment results show that the proposed system improves the performance of the system and increases the accuracy of finding similar images efficiently.",

After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user's preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences.
