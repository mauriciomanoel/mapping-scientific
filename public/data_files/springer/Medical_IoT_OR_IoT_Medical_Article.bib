abstract="The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has made medical equipment smaller and smarter, while computing environment has shifted from server-client wire/wireless communication networks toward diverse portable laptops, smartphones, tablet PCs, and PDAs. The communication between smaller IoT devices has added to the accuracy and convenience of distance healthcare services. However, security issues in communication sessions resulting from the leakage of personal medical information, infringements of privacy and improper management of medical information are looming large. Since personal medical information is transmitted between wire/wireless devices, the threats to secure distance medical service could be detrimental to further advancement of IoT in healthcare. Hence, this paper proposed a method of addressing the vulnerabilities to a range of attacks in the communication between medical devices. The proposed IoT-based communication protocol used random numbers and session keys to transmit hashed and encrypted data, and underwent a formal verification, where the transmitted data remained intact against data extraction and other attacks.",

abstract="Rapid proliferation in state-of-the art technologies has revolutionized the medical market for providing urgent, effective and economical health facilities to aging society. In this context media (i.e., video) transmission is considered as a quite significant step during first hour of the emergency for presenting a big and better picture of the event. However, the energy hungry media transmission process and slow progress in battery technologies have become a major and serious problem for the evolution of video technology in medical internet of things (MIoT) or internet of medical things (IoMT). So, promoting Green (i.e., energy-efficient) transmission during voluminous and variable bit rate (VBR) video in MIoT is a challenging and crucial problem for researchers and engineers. Therefore, the need arose to conduct research on Green media transmission techniques to cater the need of upcoming wearable healthcare devices. Thus, this research contributes in two distinct ways; first, a novel and sustainable Green Media Transmission Algorithm (GMTA) is proposed, second, a mathematical model and architecture of Green MIoT are designed by considering a 8-min medical media stream named, `Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis' to minimize transmission energy consumption in media-aware MIoT, and to develop feasible media transmission schedule for sensitive and urgent health information from physian to patients and vice vers through extremely power hungry natured wearable devices. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed GMTA saves energy up to 41{\%}, to serve the community.",

abstract="Among the extensive and impressive collection of applications enabled by IoT, smart and interactive healthcare is a particularly important one. To gather rich information indicator of our mental and physical health, IoT based sensors are either worn on the body or embedded in the living environment. Moreover, by incorporating the mobile computing technology in IoT based healthcare systems, the reactive care system can be transformed to proactive and preventive healthcare systems. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT based smart student m-healthcare monitoring framework is proposed. This framework computes the student diseases severity by predicting the potential disease with its level by temporally mining the health measurements collected from medical and other IoT devices. To effectively analyze the student healthcare data, an architectural model for smart student health care system has been designed. In our case study, health dataset of 182 suspected students are simulated to generate relevant waterborne diseses cases. This data is further analyzed to validate our model by using k-cross validation approach. Pattern based diagnosis scheme is applied using various classification algorithms and then results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and response time. Experimental results show that Decision tree (C4.5) and k-neighest neighbour algorithms perform better as compared to other classifiers in terms of above mentioned parameters. Moreover, the proposed methodology is effective in decision making by delivering time sensitive information to caretaker or doctor within specific time. Lastly, the temporal granule pattern based presentation reterives effective diagnosis results for the proposed system.",

Excessive diagnosis has recently been a significant issue in the field of medicine. Excessive diagnosis issue is expected to be significantly reduced if establishing the easily configurable IoT server, communication with medical devices, and communication among hospitals by transmitting medical results to users. With the advancement of hacking technology, many hackers are interested in medical information and medical infrastructure, and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) is expanding in Korea. A number of medical ISMS projects are discussed, based on ISO 27791 standards derived from ISO 27001 standards. Large hospitals in South Korea have a variety of platforms that misrepresent personal information, and various platforms deal with sensitive medical information, but small and medium-sized hospitals use platforms that are not considered legal considerations.In this paper, we intend to establish a legal information sharing platform, which is legally considered legally limited and is responsible for the safety of the medical information.In the IoT server with limited resources, light-weighted and user-friendly protocols are frequently utilized over those that derive traffic and consume much resource. Under these circumstances, this study is intended to suggest IoT network that medical devices are able to create ubiquitous environment for users by utilizing simple service discovery protocol as a protocol provided without imposing much burden on limited resources and highly secured extensible messaging and presence protocol.",

abstract="Internet of things technology has recently drawn much attention across industries. IoT technology has gradually been applied to industries and everyday life in general including healthcare, where people can access hospital information systems to view personal health and medical information. Still, due to security vulnerabilities, personal health and medical information is prone to hacking attacks. Thus, concerns over privacy invasion have come to the fore, and at the same time security issues are considered to override information services. This paper proposes a communication protocol based on hash lock, session keys, random numbers and security keys designed to be safe against intruders' hacking attempts in information communication between medical devices. Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program. In brief, the proposed communication protocol for medical devices is safe and secure against diverse attacks.",

abstract="Nowadays, multimedia is considered to be the biggest big data as it dominates the traffic in the Internet and mobile phones. Currently symmetric encryption algorithms are used in IoT but when considering multimedia big data in IoT, symmetric encryption algorithms incur more computational cost. In this paper, we have designed and developed a resource-efficient encryption system for encrypting multimedia big data in IoT. The proposed system takes the advantages of the Feistel Encryption Scheme, an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and genetic algorithms. To satisfy high throughput, the GPU has also been used in the proposed system. This system is evaluated on real IoT medical multimedia data to benchmark the encryption algorithms such as MARS, RC6, 3-DES, DES, and Blowfish in terms of computational running time and throughput for both encryption and decryption processes as well as the avalanche effect. The results show that the proposed system has the lowest running time and highest throughput for both encryption and decryption processes and highest avalanche effect with compared to the existing encryption algorithms. To satisfy the security objective, the developed algorithm has better Avalanche Effect with compared to any of the other existing algorithms and hence can be incorporated in the process of encryption/decryption of any plain multimedia big data. Also, it has shown that the classical and modern ciphers have very less Avalanche Effect and hence cannot be used for encryption of confidential multimedia messages or confidential big data. The developed encryption algorithm has higher Avalanche Effect and for instance, AES in the proposed system has an Avalanche Effect of {\%}52.50. Therefore, such system is able to secure the multimedia big data against real-time attacks.",

In this paper, a new reversible information hiding scheme is proposed which supports the direct operation in homomorphic encrypted domain. The proposed ``Joint Hiding and Tracing, JHT'' tactics and the ``3 Level Integrity Authentication Scheme'' devote to piracy tracing and integrity authentication. To enhance security, the Paillier homomorphic encryption and Arnold technology are employed. Furthermore, we present the dual region division tactics including Data/Signature region division and Texture/Smooth region division. Data/Signature region division is to circumvent conflicts, and Texture/Smooth region division is fit well with the human visual characteristics. Besides, neighboring quadratic optimization approach is presented to eliminate the smooth/texture isolated islands in the texture/smooth regions. In addition, Extended Integer Transform and position image are developed to achieve reversibility and circumvent overflow/underflow problems. Experimental results confirm the efficient of the proposed scheme, and demonstrate it not only realizes privacy protection, integrity authentication and piracy tracing, but also holds the characteristics of higher security, larger capacity and better restoration quality.",

abstract="The technology of IoT combined with medical systems is expected to support advanced medical services. However, unsolved security problems, such as misuse of medical devices, illegal access to the medical server and so on, make IoT-based medical systems not be applied widely. In addition, users have a high burden of computation to access Things for the explosive growth of IoT devices. Because medical information is critical and important, but users have a restricted computing power, IoT-based medical systems are required to provide secure and efficient authentication for users. In this paper, we propose a selective group authentication scheme using Shamir's threshold technique. The property of selectivity gives the right of choice to users to form a group which consists of things users select and access. And users can get an access authority for those Things at a time. Thus, our scheme provides an efficient user authentication for multiple Things and conditional access authority for safe IoT-based medical information system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first in which selectivity is combined with group authentication in IoT environments.",

This paper provides a thorough investigation of the randomness of ciphertext obtained from Simeck, Kasumi, DES and AES. The design of our randomness analysis is based on five metrics implemented following the guidance of the NIST statistical test suite for cryptographic applications. This analysis also provides performance and power consumption evaluations for the selected cryptographic algorithms using different platforms and measures.

The proposed algorithms minimize transmission energy consumption, battery charge consumption and high current profile. These algorithms also prolongs the battery lifetime of those sensor nodes during video transmission. Experimental results demonstrates that BSA outperforms LA to minimize battery drain by improving its lifetime up to 19.8 {\%}. However, the LA performs better than BSA in context of transmission energy saving up to 49.49 {\%}.
