abstract="Current logistics processes demand more detailed and more up-to-date information about the logistic objects and their state than is provided by bar codes or RF-ID smart labels. Several aspects of the logistic chain can be improved by storage, processing and transmission of more sophisticated kinds of information and data. All of these aspects require more intelligent solutions such as intelligent objects or smart items. This document gives an overview over some of the technical challenges that need to be overcome to build such networks, sample applications that have already been realized and necessary technologies that are required by applications in logistics.",

abstract="This paper is a record of the First International Workshop on Database Architectures for the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things refers to the future internet which will contain trillions of nodes representing various objects from small ubiquitous sensor devices and handhelds to large web servers and supercomputer clusters. The workshop investigated a number of areas appertaining to data management in the Internet of Things from storage structures, through database management methods, to service-oriented architectures and new approaches to information search. Running orthogonal to these layers the matter of security was also considered. Taking a philosophical viewpoint our whole current framework for understanding data management may be ill-equipped to meet the challenges of the Internet of Things. The workshop gave participants the chance to discuss these matters, exchange ideas and explore future collaborations.",

abstract="A software framework is a reusable design that requires various software components to function, almost out of the box. To specify a framework, the creator must specify the different components that form the framework and how to instantiate them. Also, the communication interfaces between these various components must be defined. In this paper, we propose such a framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for developing applications for handling emergencies of some kind. We demonstrate the usage of our framework by explaining an application developed using it. The application is a system for tracking the status of autistic students in a school and also for alerting their parents/care takers in case of an emergency.",

abstract="Internet of Things or IoT is one of the common and widely used technology used for the formation of smart environments based on sensor-based scenarios. At the current implementation, IoT is being implemented for assorted scenarios including environmental monitoring, production, manufacturing, healthcare, home automations, transportations, and many others. The key idea behind IoT is the machine to machine communication in which each and every device is connected using sensor technology. This paradigm is used for the development and deployment of smart cities and sensor-based infrastructures. Nowadays, IoT is being implemented in many of the transportation services and integrated in cars as well as freight vehicles which make it IoV (Internet of Vehicles). Using this approach, the remote IoT control servers can monitor any of the moving vehicles in real time and tracking can be done on multiple parameters. In the classical implementation, the remote monitoring and tracking is one using towers or base stations and satellites which is not very effective because of assorted quality of service factors. For the enhanced scenario integration, the global positioning system is used but number of security vulnerabilities can be there and cracking can be done. This paper underlines and highlights the scope of IoT in assorted applications with the association to different case scenarios.",

abstract="Internet of Things is mainly about connected devices embedded in our everyday environment. Typically, `interaction' in the context of IoT means interfaces which allow people to either monitor or configure IoT devices. Some examples include mobile applications and embedded touchscreens for control of various functions (e.g., heating, lights, and energy efficiency) in environments such as homes and offices. In some cases, humans are an explicit part of the scenario, such as in those cases where people are monitored (e.g., children and elderly) by IoT devices. Interaction in such applications is still quite straightforward, mainly consisting of traditional graphical interfaces, which often leads to clumsy co-existence of human and IoT devices. Thus, there is a need to investigate what kinds of interaction techniques could provide IoT to be more human oriented, what is the role of automation and interaction, and how human originated data can be used in IoT.",

abstract="In remote patient monitoring the wireless medical sensor networks WMSNs play a crucial role. In WMSNs, the sensor nodes are deployed in patient's body for collecting physiological data. The patient's physiological data are highly sensitive and important. Any malicious modification in physiological data will make wrong diagnoses and harm the patient health. Therefore, privacy, data security, and user authentication are extremely important for accessing patient's real-time data over an insecure channel. In this regard, we design a secure and robust three-factor remote user authentication and key agreement scheme for remote patient monitoring. We simulate our protocol using AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool, which asserts that the protocol is secure from the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The informal security verification proves that the suggested protocol is secure from various security threats. Performance comparison shows that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of computation cost and communication cost.",

In the existing EWS systems, monitoring of patient's vital signs and the determining the score is mostly performed in a paper and pen based way. Furthermore, currently it is done solely in a hospital environment. In this paper, we propose to import this system to patients' home to provide an automated platform which not only monitors patents' vital signs but also looks over his/her activities and the surrounding environment. Thanks to the Internet-of-Things technology, we present an intelligent early warning method to remotely monitor in-home patients and generate alerts in case of different medical emergencies or radical changes in condition of the patient. We also demonstrate an early warning score analysis system which continuously performs sensing, transferring, and recording vital signs, activity-related data, and environmental parameters.",

However, the large majority of the current IoT research and development expects that the IoT ``things'' communicate wirelessly, leaving the question of their energy supply and communication reliability more-or-less open. The obvious alternative, wire line, has gained much less attention, perhaps since it is too well known. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient IoT architecture for healthcare applications that leverages clinical and home care scenarios, given their typically fixed, stationary nature, as the mobility of patients is in many cases confined to a room or a building. The architecture is based on intelligent, wired gateways that are power-efficient and low-cost. The gateways link wired/wireless medical sensors and hospital appliances to web services, enabling hospital automation and widespread data collection and aggregation of vital signs in a convenient, and cost-effective approach.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in a broad range of healthcare applications. However, so far this effort is mainly restricted to actual patients actively undergoing treatment. From the perspective of IoT, these kinds of efforts should spread to the preventive activity of healthy people in the not-so-distant future. Healthy people, whose population is much larger than patients, presumably have various latent needs or wants for an IoT-driven healthcare system, compared with the actual patients. Discerning the real needs from the latent needs of healthy people for preventive care is the key to build up an innovative and favorable IoT-based system. This research tackled this problem from the product device side. We utilized multiple analyses including cluster analysis, graphical modeling, and text-mining, in order to extract from survey data real and useful consumer needs, which can be expected to propel the innovation of health-related home electronics. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by a case study using practical questionnaire data, while selecting a blood-pressure monitor and a sleep monitor as case study examples.",

The advances in various streams such as sensing techniques, nanotechnologies, embedded systems, wireless communication networks, and miniaturization resulting to evolve intelligent systems to monitor and control various medical parameters in post-operational days. Hence, the IoT (Internet of Things) is emerged as a recent trend in healthcare communication systems. IoT serves as a catalyst for the healthcare and plays a major role in numerous healthcare applications. Wearable sensors recognize anomalous and unforeseen conditions by examining physiological parameters along with the symptoms and transfers the vital signs for medical evaluation. Hence, prompt provisional medication can be done immediately to avoid severe conditions. In the proposed system, a microcontroller is used as a gateway to communicate to the several sensors depending on parameters to be monitored such as pulse rate counter, temperature sensor, accelerometer, etc. The microcontroller acquires the sensor data, processes it, and transmits to the network through appropriate data transmission protocol, successively providing a real-time monitoring of the healthcare parameters for healthcare professionals. The doctor can access the data anytime by simply logging to the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) webpage or typing the corresponding unique IP (Internet protocol) address in Internet browser.",

Therefore, how to address security problem in RFID system is a crucial issue for the security of the IoT. The RFID authentication protocol is a key cryptographic protocol ensuring communication security because it could provide authentication between the tag and the server. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication protocols were studied widely because they could provide better security attributes compared with traditional RFID authentications. Lv et al. proposed three ECC-based RFID protocols and claimed their protocols could overcome weaknesses in previous protocols. Unfortunately, in this paper, we show that Lv et al.'s protocols cannot withstand the man-in-the-middle attack.

However, due to the limited resources available and privacy concerns, security issues constitute a major obstacle to their deployment. Among these issues, key distribution for heterogeneous nodes is problematic due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives. This paper introduces a new key management scheme that aims to establish session keys for highly resource-constrained nodes ensuring security protection through strong encryption and authentication means. Our protocol is based on collaboration by offloading heavy asymmetric cryptographic operations to a set of third parties. The generated shared secret is then used to derive further credentials. Security analysis demonstrates that our protocol provides strong security features while the scarcity of resources is taken into consideration.",

abstract="Human security is becoming a grave concern with each passing day. Daily we hear news regarding gruesome and heinous crimes against elders, women and children. Accidents and industrial mishaps have become commonplace. Computers and gadgets have progressed a lot during past decades but little has been done to tackle the challenging yet immensely important field of physical security of people. With the advent of pervasive computing, Internet of Things (IoT), the omnipresent cloud computing and its extension fog computing, it has now become possible to provide a security cover to people and thwart any transgression against them. In this paper, we will be providing a security framework incorporating pervasive and wearable computing, IoT, cloud and fog computing to safeguard individuals and preclude any mishap.",

In this paper we explore the world of IoT (Internet of Things) which is quite new and unexplored. Today, many vendors are logging into this field and are designing new and innovative hardware and software applications; so in the near future communication is bound to happen not only between electronic devices which are in LoS (Line of Sight) but also between those devices that are located remotely and would communicate with each other in a distributed computing domain using RPC (Remote Procedure calls) in a client-server architecture environment. To our idea and knowledge this is the first major foray into this domain and to make it happen we have undertaken a case study of HMIS (Health care Management Information System) and analyzed its results.",

abstract="Internet of Things enables every node on a personal network to be managed and monitored remotely over the Internet. Biometric devices, used for access control or as bio-sensors, form a critical part of Internet of Things and are identified using IPv6 address. Malicious users can track activity of these devices by spoofing IPv6 addresses from unsecure wireless communication channels. Tracking device activity and identifying user behavior of the device poses a great threat to device identity and data generated by it. Such a threat can be avoided by keeping the device's IPv6 address hidden from attacker. This study proposes a method to privacy enable IPv6 address configuration for connected devices in general and biometric devices in particular, while connected as a part of Internet of Things. It is proposed that by changing the device's IPv6 address periodically and pseudorandomly, its identity can be kept private to a large extent. These address changes are configured on devices based on congruence classes, which generate non-repeatable integer sequence. It is proposed that the interface identification part of IPv6 address is configured with two-level hierarchy with each level level using a different congruence class. Such configuration generates different identification values to ensure conflict free address configuration. The proposition is analyzed for privacy preserving property and communication cost. The results of performance benchmarking using Cooja simulator show that the method does not impose substantial communication overhead on IPv6 address configuration process.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) promising a new generation of services been offered to a human being through a world of interconnected objects (called ``things'') that may use different communication technologies. Objects, in IoT, are seamlessly connected on its owner/user behalf. To offer services, the service providers need to truly identify the effective actor/user rather than the communicated devices. Currently, users have relationships with multiple objects that can also be used to determine their user. These relationships between actors are changeable or may even vanish; however, they are important to distinguish the actual requester of the service. Hence, it is important to consider them when identifying the effective actor of the communicated object. This paper models these relationships, representing them in a general form, and proposes a new semantic identifier format that allows service providers to identify the service requester identity across domains based on those relationships.",

abstract="In the emerging field of Internet of Things (IoT), where computerized devices are combined in creative new ways, there is a need to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the systems being built, e.g. in the form of Android ``apps''. This is generally a complicated, time consuming task. We report from a controlled experiment that evaluates a new approach for building GUIs that aims to make it easier for more people to build quality GUIs. A tool supporting the new approach (GPE) was compared to Android Studio (AS                                                                                  {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\}}{\$}{\$}                  ), the industry standard for Android development.

abstract="With the widespread of Internet of Things' devices and sensors, the use of applications for combining data streams is increasing in a high number of dynamic contexts, with a huge variety of users having radically different backgrounds and a plethora of diverse tasks to perform. On the one hand, users need a system able to support them in detecting significant events with respect to their context of use. On the other hand, such users need an environment in which they can express proper requirements for enabling the system to react autonomously according to events in the real/physical world, by running processes that trigger actions and perform services. In this paper, we provide the design of a web environment that we are developing around the concept of event, that is simple or complex data streams gathered from physical and social sensors that are encapsulated with contextual information (space, time, thematic). Moreover, from a study of the most diffused applications for Internet of Things that provide the user with tools for controlling the combination of data streams coming from devices and sensors, we identify and discuss some open problems and proposes a new paradigm and language to address them and to be integrated in our web environment.",

Objective of our approach is to increase lifetime and throughput of WSN where sensors can join the Internet through gateway, to achieve this goal, we use link cost to select gateway. The link cost is the ratio between distance to Internet and energy level of sensor. The sensor has been selected as gateway which has minimum link cost. To ensure minimum link cost can be performed, we divided WSN into grids where, gateways have been selected in each grid. Results justify its accuracy.",

abstract="The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely used matrix factorization tool which underlies many useful applications, e.g. recommendation system, abnormal detection and data compression. Under the environment of emerging Internet of Things (IoT), there would be an increasing demand for data analysis. Moreover, due to the large scope of IoT, most of the data analysis work should be handled by fog computing. However, the fog computing devices may not be trustable while the data privacy is the significant concern of the users. Thus, the data privacy should be preserved when performing SVD for data analysis. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving fog computing framework for SVD computation. The security and performance analysis shows the practicability of the proposed framework. One application of recommendation system is introduced to show the functionality of the proposed framework.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) evolves very rapidly over time, since everything such as sensors/actuators linked together from around the world with use of evolution of ubiquitous computing through the Internet. These devices have a unique IP address in order to communicate with each other and transmit data with features of wireless technologies. Fog computing or so called edge computing brings all Cloud features to embedded devices at edge network and adds more features to servers like pre-store data of Cloud, fast response, and generate overhasty users reporting. Fog mediates between Cloud and IoT devices and thus enables new types of computing and services. The future applications take the advantage of combing the two concepts Fog and Cloud in order to provide low delay Fog-based and high capacity of storage Cloud-based. This paper proposes an IoT architecture for healthcare network based on Fog to Cloud and Data in Motion (F2CDM). The proposed architecture is designed and implemented over three sites: Site 1 contains the embedded devices layer, Site 2 consists of the Fog network layer, while Site 3 consists of the Cloud network. The Fog layer is represented by a middleware server in Al-Nahrain University with temporary storage such that the data lives inside for 30 min. During this time, the selection of up-normality in behavior is send to the Cloud while the rest of the data is wiped out. On the other hand, the Cloud stores all the incoming data from Fog permanently. The F2CDM works using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for fast response. The results show that all data can be monitored from the Fog in real time while the critical data can be monitored from Cloud. In addition, the response time is evaluated using traffic generator called Tsung. It has been found that the proposed architecture reduces traffic on Cloud network and provides better data analysis.",

abstract="The smart spaces paradigm and the M3 concept have already showed their potential for constructing advanced service infrastructures. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the possibility to make any ``thing'' a user or component of such a service infrastructure. In this paper, we consider the crucial design challenges that smart spaces meet for deploying in IoT: (1) interoperability, (2) information processing, (3) security and privacy. The paper makes a step toward a systematized view on smart spaces as a computing paradigm for IoT applications. We summarize the groundwork from pilot M3 implementations and discuss solutions to cope with the challenges. The considered solutions can be already used in advanced service infrastructures.",

While the variation of evaluation value for consumer information products becomes bigger, pure bundling strategy should be taken by the information service providers. When the information provider wants to adopt pure components strategy, then the variation of evaluation value for consumer information products should be satisfied by certain conditions.",

With IoT infrastructure, physical objects such as wearable objects, television, refrigerator, smart phones, supply-chain items and any objects across the globe would get connected using the Internet. Sensing, radio waves, mobile technology, embedded systems and Internet technology are promising actors which play significant roles in IoT infrastructure. Security and privacy issues in IoT scenarios would be much more challenging than what is been used in the conventional wireless scenarios. In particular, the constrained environments require lightweight primitives, secure design and effective integration into other environments in order to see IoT in its desired shape. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy challenges in IoT scenarios and applications with special emphasis on resource-constrained environments' security objectives and privacy requirement. We provide different perspectives of IoT, discuss about important driving forces of IoT, and propose a generic construction of secure protocol suitable for constrained environments with respect to IoT scenarios and applications.",

It has been predicted that 25 billion devices will be connected by 2015, and 50 billion devices by 2020; all contributing towards the Internet of Things (IoT). This rapid increase exposes the obvious need for enhancements in various underlying technologies. IPv6 for example, has been developed to provide 340 undecillion IP addresses, and 3GPP LTE and its further enhancements provides impressive high bitrates cost-efficiently. That been said, there is still a limit on the amount of data that can go through a frequency channel. Therefore, the surge in demand for data by the billions of devices emphasizes the need to re-visit spectrum planning. Beginning with a review on the success of unlicensed spectrum operations, this work looks into the potentials of complementing the licensed frequency bands with unlicensed by tapping into the advantages of millimeter wave access technology.",

In this paper, we describe an optimisation to the SPARQL-to-SQL approach, based on a study of time-series IoT data structures, that employs metadata abstraction and efficient translation by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data `just-in-time'. We evaluate our approach against RDF stores, state-of-the-art SPARQL-to-SQL engines and streaming SPARQL engines, in the context of IoT data and scenarios.

It uses the dynamic programming method to calculate the trusted path of data transmission between nodes, to ensure that the data transmission between trusted nodes trusted. The routing mechanism proposed in this chapter has the characteristics of low overhead, high scalability and easy project realization. Simulation experiments show that the routing mechanism is good to against attack, extensive environmental adaptability, can effectively resist selective forwarding attacks, node hijacking attacks. Compared with the existing scheme, this mechanism effectively reduces the communication overhead in the routing establishment process, and significantly improves the network performance and has a good application prospect.",

abstract="The past few years have marked a shift in Web development as users have become accustomed to Web applications with dynamic content and enhanced user experience. New emerging protocols and standards seek to provide increased flexibility by making available new models of interaction to Web applications. One such application is the Web of Things. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight architecture for the Web of Things, based on RESTful approaches. We further show, through a proof of concept application, taking a smart city as its context, how new technologies can be combined to support our proposed architecture and application development for the Web of Things. We argue that the use of protocols and standards such as WebSocket, WebSocket API, Server-Sent Events and JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation, can make the vision of the Web of Things a reality.",

abstract="Food information is a crucial tool for facilitating consumers in decision-making activities related to their consumption process. Recent advances in ``Internet of food'' technologies (such as food sensors, cloud computing, food data analysis, and mobile app technologies) makes possible to conceive new consumer information platforms. The rationale is to empower consumers by letting them get more relevant food information than they usually obtain through on-product labeling, mass media or other traditional channels. In this paper, we envisage a new generation of food information provision services, called intelligent food services (IFSs), which would be responsive to consumer's expectations and information needs. We outline IFS structure and main features as well as constitutive elements of user-IFS interaction context. Particularly, we focus on food-in-context awareness capability and we discuss its influence on consumer and IFS behaviors.",

Considering the number of such devices, volume of data they generate and the security concerns, not only from a communication perspective but also from its mere physical presence outside a secure/monitored vault demands innovative architectural approaches, applications and end user systems.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) makes reference to the interconnection between different devices and internet; in the last years has been studied its development, impact and improvement, to answer to common needs of society, its requirements and to the kind of applications that demands to be developed. That contributes largely to the technology development and hence also to the growth of the cities. Nevertheless, so far applications just reply to particular necessities, so it is important to know how its structure can be developed to attend to the general requirements of cities to become those into Smart Cities, without affecting their correct performance. This paper aims to show a proposal of a standard IoT architecture for Smart Cities done from author's research, review and analysis of available data, especially of generic and implemented structures in some Smart Cities around the world.",

abstract="In this work we suggest a new device to instrument everyday objects in the end-user life cycle phase that makes everyday life easier for the elderly. The instrumentation of products, such as food, transforms them into smarter and more intelligent products. The equipped product notifies the user when food is spoiled and---interconnected with other smart products---advises against side effects that occur when food is consumed while a certain medication is ingested. We describe the considerations that were made towards a first prototype from a technical perspective. An interaction model was developed, a requirements analysis performed and several design and development considerations made. An architecture shows the information flow between sensors, actuators, and the Internet of Things. In the end, the prototype of a product sleeve is presented that is easy to handle and intuitive to operate. A feedback study is planned in the near future.",

abstract="IoT systems and devices are being used for various applications ranging from households to large industries on a very large scale. Design of complex systems comprising of different IoT devices involves meeting of security requirements for the whole system. Creating a general security framework for such interconnected systems is a challenging task and currently we do not have standard mechanisms for securing such systems. The first step towards developing such a framework would be to build a classification mechanism which can identify the security capabilities or parameters of the different entities comprising an IoT system. In this paper we describe one such mechanism which can take user input to classify the different components of a complex system and thereby determine their capability to support security mechanisms of different degrees. This in turn would enable designers to decide what kind of security protocols they need to adopt to achieve end-to-end security for the whole system.",

When we intensely show our concern to the construction of iSC, the fragility of supply chain caused by continuous pursue of high efficiency cannot be neglected. Resilience resembles to the immune system of supply chain, the more we pay attention to it, the more robust and stable the supply chain is. Henceforth, through the synergy effect of the acquired experience during the enhancement of resilience and the accumulation of information and network technology which progresses during the establishment of supply chain, operation of supply chain will turn out to be more simple and secure.

abstract="The Information Society relies on an increasingly diverse mass of digital information, a trend accentuated by the Internet of Things in which Real World Objects (RWOs) have their own Resource Identifiers and related data. In this setting, the goals of the CONVERGENCE framework are to enhance current media handling with new functionality and extend the traditional concept of media to include digital representations of RWOs. The CONVERGENCE framework is based on the concept of Versatile Digital Item (VDI), a structured package of digital content and meta-information, inspired by the MPEG-21 standard but designed to address a broader range of application domains, including the management of RWOs in the Internet of Things. The VDI is supported by an innovative middleware and by tools and applications. The CONVERGENCE framework incorporates six innovations: (1) VDIs provide uniform mechanisms to handle different classes of information, including RWOs; (2) VDIs are intrinsically dynamic, allowing both providers and consumers to update content; (3) VDIs support ``digital forgetting'' (automatic ``un-publishing,'' automated garbage collection of VDIs after a user-defined expiry date); (4) VDIs meet security and privacy needs of both professional and nonprofessional consumers and providers; (5) VDIs support new modes of semantic search; (6) VDIs allow easy sharing of information across multiple, heterogeneous devices. In this chapter, we present the CONVERGENCE framework, its main concepts and ideas, some proposals to make it real, and some use cases and we show how our proposed concept can be a fundamental enabler for the Internet of Things.",

Most financial institutions and banks try to innovate and diversify payment processes to make it more challenging and secure to improve their digital skills. Understand customer's behaviors also become a successful key factor in the market at the same time, that's why Internet of Things (IoT) can be the best solution to solve the issue of collecting and sharing data via internet among different ``things'', as devices and objects (Sensors, ATMs, POS, Smartphones, Computers, payment gateways (ecommerce), notebooks, etc.). The architectural and technical sides remain a problem, since conventional database management system and existing banking systems are not capable anymore to handle, store and process this massive volume of data with sufficient real time. This paper, discuss Hadoop Distributed File System and MapReduce, as an architecture for storing and retrieving information from massive volumes of datasets that we can collect via Internet from different objects based on the advantage and potential of Internet of things.",

abstract="The evolved vision of the Internet-of-Things predicts tremendous growth in the number of connected human-unattended objects over the following years. However, existing wireless network protocols were not originally designed for such excessive numbers of nodes. Therefore, currently deployed networking solutions are not optimized for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. To bridge in this gap, IEEE 802.16m cellular technology targets extensive improvements to support M2M communications. As such, performance assessment of an 802.16m-based network with respect to the expected M2M scenarios is topical. In particular, the contention-based procedure for network admission control is very likely to become a bottleneck for the entire system. Therefore, we focus performance assessment of the standardized collision resolution algorithm, used in the random access channel, with respect to M2M. In particular, this paper addresses a Smart Grid use case, where a large number of devices access the network within a relatively short period of time. We discuss specific performance requirements that apply to the considered scenario. Then, an evaluation methodology to investigate the adaptability of the 802.16m system is presented. Finally, we conclude on the capability of the 802.16m technology to support an excessive number of human-unattended devices.",

Context aware devices and ambient computing techniques have expanded the application of the IoT into new areas such as assisted living, eHealth, and elderly care. However, there are challenges to analyze the large volumes of sensor and context data generated by these devices. Also, there are serious security and privacy concerns especially in the area of health care that need to be addressed. This paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies for ambient assisted living (AAL) and proposes an architecture based on SOA.",

NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi Low Power and 6LoWPAN are some of the most extended technologies, which are making possible the wireless transmission for sensor networks communication and integrate this networks with the Internet, in order to reach an Internet of Things (IoT). These networks allow us collect a lot of information process and understand it and act, according to the situation required, effectively. Our research work is focused for the integration of NFC to control the heart status of a patient continuously. This work analyzes the capabilities from NFC to make feasible the integration of continuous data transmission. The main goal of this continuous data transmission is enable a new generation of mobile health tools that make feasible to analyze process and make a preliminary diagnosis of the state of a patient's heart anytime/anywhere. For this purpose, it is presented how an electrocardiogram clinical device is integrated with a mobile phone enabled with NFC. This is evaluated the performance with the native communication model from the sensor concluding that it is necessary some preprocessing to work properly in real time. For that reason, it is also proposed, evaluated and prototyped a preprocessing module to solve the mentioned communication challenges for NFC in clinical environments.",

abstract="The increasing percentage of elderly people in the population (at least in Europe and North America) is part of a demographic change that will have an enormous impact on the society in the next few years. Thus, intelligent solutions that rely on the Internet of Things have been proposed in the literature, with the final goal to give remote support to elderly people at their home. Those solutions aim at monitoring activities and behaviors, and automatically send alarms in case of anomalies, putting in contact the end-user with her/his GP or alerting the emergency center or familiars, according to the specific needs. However, although the great deal of worldwide researches in the area of the Internet of Things and its early applications to healthcare and teleassistance, the technologies to apply it in real-world with the necessary dependability levels are far from being assessed. In this paper, we propose novel software engineering concepts that, by synthesizing existing proposals bringing in the lessons of agent-based computing and agent-oriented software engineering, can effectively support the systematic (and thus more dependable) development of Internet of Things applications.",

Effective security has to be built-in, not patched upon. To efficaciously tackle the challenge in distributed IoT systems, we present a security context framework which applies adaptive security contexts to properly track data of interest.

abstract="Co-production of public services is well known in the public management literature. Many studies show how co-production makes public services not only more efficient but also more effective. It the recent years, the development of several ICT applications and projects have shown that ICT has the potential to make co-production an easy and common practice for all citizens, changing completely how services are delivered on a large scale. The research, after having presented some existing cases of ICTs application that favorite co-production, shows that using ICT for co-production might help the state to deliver public services that generate Public Value. The paper follows with an in depth analysis according to the Actor Network Theory to understand if co-production through ICT might induce structural changes in the public administration allowing in future citizens to be actively involved in the production of public services. The research will conclude by providing a proposal to implement permanently co-production in the public sector.",

abstract="Due to protocols such as 6LoWPAN and CoAP, wireless sensor nodes have become an integral part of the Internet. While this makes their data available on the Internet, it still remains a strictly devicecentric approach. However, one is usually interested in the phenomena observed by one or more devices and not in the sensors themselves. To bridge this gap, we introduce and evaluate the concept of Service-Level Semantic Entities (SLSE). They support the automatic semantic annotation of real-world objects based on networked sensor devices. SLSE continuously collect observations of sensors attached to some objects, and aggregates them to descriptions of the objects themselves. It then makes this augmented object data available as (semantic) linked data. This removes several layers of indirection in the semantic data, and allows to directly access properties of real-world objects.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnection of tiny real-world objects using sensor, actuators, and software's designed for exchanging data and controlling them. It invades business landscape on massive scale integrating heterogeneous devices. Some of the application includes media, environmental monitoring, infrastructure and energy management, medical, healthcare system, and transportation. Earlier, in these applications, the primary issue is handling efficient communication among the interconnected devices to have an extended network lifetime. Nowadays, as data grows rapidly in the IoT, security and privacy is also a major issue to be concentrated in these applications to reduce vulnerabilities. Recent studies show that the existing IP security protocols and algorithm have technical limitation in applying it to the context Internet of Things. In particular, when a new device enters to an existing secured network, the network should ensure that the new device is authenticated and authorized properly with respect to the properties of existing network. Otherwise, similar to other network, IoT network also will be subjected to various attacks such as physical attacks, service disruption attacks, data attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. Hence, in this work, an algorithm to authenticate and authorize when a new device gets added to the existing network is proposed. The algorithm is tested for various attacks and the results are proven to be efficient and secure.",

They are being used in domains such as infrastructure management, and medical and healthcare systems, where business interests and our security and privacy are at stake. Yet, security mechanisms have been appallingly neglected on many IoT platforms. In this paper we present a secure access control mechanism for extremely lightweight embedded microcontrollers. Being based on Sancus, a hardware-only Trusted Computing Base and Protected Module Architecture for the embedded domain, our mechanism allows for multiple software modules on an IoT-node to securely share resources. We implement and evaluate our approach for two application scenarios, a shared memory system and a shared flash drive. Our implementation is based on a Sancus-enabled TI MSP430 microcontroller. We show that our mechanism can give high security guarantees at small runtime overheads and a moderately increased size of the Trusted Computing Base.",

The assessment, in real-time, would be useful as most of the times a person is not in presence of health professionals. But own assessment lacks precision and reaction time that could be risky in critical conditions. The pervasiveness of Internet connections and ubiquity of smart devices makes it possible to overcome that limitation. By using sensing capabilities of portable/wearable devices in conjunction with medical knowledge and clinical history it is possible to monitor a person's health status in real-time with reaction mechanisms. The objective is to keep track of collected evidence, and relate with existing knowledge for better assessment. This paper proposes a framework, inspired by the brain and physiology, capturing real-time health related information, at a person's location, submitting that to the cloud for reasoning and decision and triggers advice or request medical assistance.",

abstract="Sensor nodes and actuators are becoming ubiquitous and research efforts focus on addressing the various issues stemming from resources constraints and other intrinsic characteristics typically associated with such devices and their applications. In the case of wearable nodes, and especially in the context of e-Health applications, the security issues are exacerbated by the direct interaction with the human body and the associated safety and privacy concerns. This work presents a policy-based, unified, cross-platform and flexible access control framework. It adopts a web services-compliant approach to enable secure and authorized fine-grained access control to body sensor network resources and services. The proposed scheme specifically considers the very limited resources of so-called nano nodes that are anticipated to be used in such an environment. A proof-of-concept implementation is developed and a preliminary performance evaluation is presented.",

abstract="Nutrition plays a key role in both the prevention of several critical diseases and lead an healthier life in the modern society. In order to analyse household's eating habits in the Italian scenario, authors propose the design of an innovative system called ``Smart Shelve''. This system consists in a robotic structure integrable with various appliances, such as refrigerators, which allows to receive and deliver several types of foods in order to control their daily consumption. Smart Shelve is equipped with external optical sensors for food recognition, while inside it is composed of several food compartments in which load cells measure the weight of each type of food. The system is capable to warn the users who have recently conducted an incorrect style. The system is also able to send the acquired food consumption information to the cloud in order to provide statistical services regarding the nutrition style of clusters of users localized in a specific geographical area (e.g. district or region).",

In this paper, we arrive at a synthesis methodology for the IoT and demonstrate how information flow among the connected devices using a three tier architecture enables us to assess the required security and privacy of the IoT based on the given security and privacy capabilities of the components. Our methodology uses a recent information security model called RWFM (Readers-Writers Flow Model) and shows how flexible approaches of synthesis of IoT through frameworks like Django can be integrated to realize the security/privacy requirements of the IoT. We demonstrate how the methodology concretely enables us to derive the constraints to be satisfied by the underlying components and enabled communications.

Telemedicine and telehealth platforms are among the various types of IoT services that could support the provision of health services. Current Health Technology Assessment (HTA) models that are used for the evaluation of telehealth and telemedicine services do not consider IoT aspects. HTA models would ideally need to be extended to include IoT platforms, for an optimal introduction of IoT in everyday provision of health and care services. This paper presents an initial adaptation of the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST) for IoT Telemedicine services based on a literature review of IoT, telemedicine and telehealth services characteristics. MAST involves assessment of outcomes within the following seven domains: Health problem and characteristics of the application, Safety, Clinical effectiveness, Patient perspectives, Economic aspects, Organizational aspects, Socio-cultural, ethical and legal aspects. The domains of the characteristics of the application, socio-cultural, safety and ethical and legal aspects were identified as those to be adapted to cover new challenges associated to IoT services.",

This plateform uses modern IoT-related technologies such as embedded systems (Raspberry Pi and Arduino) and the MQTT communication protocol. Compared to many related works, monitoring is enterely achieved using a box as a central element, while the mobile device (tablet) is only used for controlling the acquisition procedure using a simple web browser, without any specific application. An example of a time stamped set of acquired data is shown, based on the in-home monitoring of healthy volunteers.",

Two million Apps have ever since found their way into each of the popular App-stores Google Play and Apple Store. We argue that the App-concept is not only well applicable to single devices but also to complete environments equipped with smart networked things. In the moment when Apps can be easily downloaded and executed in home, office and industry environments a wide new applications space will be opened up. In this work we introduce the concept of Smart Space Apps that can be downloaded from a cloud-based App-store into a smart environment where they dynamically utilize the capabilities of available smart things to optimally achieve the purpose they were installed for. We introduce a unified schema for the access of sensors and actuators of heterogeneous devices from within Smart Space Apps and describe the middleware and runtime that implements this approach. We explain how Apps are packaged into an exchangeable format and published within a cloud-based App-store. Multiple application use cases are shown and challenges of this novel approach are discussed.",

Yet, when the precise structured data describing appliance models is missing, it is difficult for such application scenarios to be realized. The developed OpenFridge ontology defines a basic vocabulary for the domain of measuring a refrigerator's energy consumption, showing that the needed ontology schemata are already in place, but need to be identified and skillfully applied. Further, the ontology has been populated from the Web using data scraping, and the created dataset semantically describing the specifics of 1032 refrigerator models with 18665 triples, make these valuable assets for the development of further applications.",

abstract="The high cost of healthcare services, the aging population and the increase of chronic disease are becoming a global concern. Several studies have indicated the need for strategies to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. A promising trend in healthcare is to move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric). Moreover, recent advances in microelectronics, wireless, sensing and information have boosted the advent of a revolutionary model involving systems and communication technology, enabling smarter ways to ``make things happen''. This new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has a broad applicability in several areas, including healthcare. The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of this technology-based healthcare approach, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve the wellness of the patients, as well as a better application of government financial resources. Based on this context, this paper aims to describe a review to comprehend the current state and future trends for healthcare applications based on IoT infrastructure, and also to find areas for further investigations.",

The proposed method provides an array of parameters characterizing frequency restructuring of medical signals in different frequency bands. Since frequency fluctuations in brain and heart rhythms are closely related to different processes in human organism, the obtained data can allow us: to identify the disease at its early stages; to test the adaptive capacity of the human organism; to give diagnostic reports on cardiovascular and nervous systems; to analyze changes in rhythm during biofeedback sessions.

The precision of acquired data and the amount of data sent by sensor-equipped IoT devices has vital impact on lifetime of these devices. In case of solutions, where multiple sensors are available for single device with limited computation power and memory, the complex compression or transformation methods cannot be applied - especially in case of nano device injected to a body. Thus this paper is focused on linear complexity segmentation algorithms that can be used by the resource-limited devices. The state-of-art data segmentation methods are analysed and adapted for simple IoT devices. Two segmentation algorithms are proposed and tested on a real-world dataset collected from a prototype of the IoT device.",

abstract="In the context of an aging population, drug intake can be a potential source of errors leading to death in some cases. Almost all of these errors are unintentional and come from incorrect prescriptions, unsuitable dosages for the patient or incompatibility with other treatments. To limit these risks which are especially important in the elderly or pre-dependency, we propose a secure system for drug treatment through the NFC (Near Field Communication) contact-less communication technology. The proposed system provides security mechanisms such as integrity, authentication, encryption and non-repudiation. To ensure this security, an extension of the international standard ISO/IED 13157 (NFC-SEC) is proposed to handle electronic signature based on a public key infrastructure.",

abstract="Recent evolution of wearable devices is primarily focused on physical health and fitness but ignore emotional health aspects of an individual. Current health services help user define goals ``Reduce weight'' but do not provide interfaces for users to define goals as ``Stay Happy''. Lot of existing research has focused on sensing user mood classification based on device data but there is limited research that has focused to diagnose and heal depression. A conventional method of doctors detecting depression is based on Hamilton scale of depression with a set of questions and is an intrusive method to probe depression patients. IoT devices are slowly gaining popularity and huge data that is generated from these devices can be leveraged to determine user emotional health. Proposed method attempts to analyze IoT device data and calculate user depression scale and recommends relevant social communication with user social contacts (Friends, Family Members). Identifying precise social contacts and recommending actions and content to recover from early stages of depression is one of the goals of the proposed system. Method recommends relevant social contacts based on current depression score. Proposed system tries to monitor user's emotional state and more tries to act as preventive health assistant to correct emotional states in early stages and avoids user moving to advanced stages of depression.",

abstract="Chronic diseases are becoming the world's leading causes of death and disability, and are predicted to account for almost three quarters of all deaths by 2020. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) based telemedical system has been developed using LabView instrumentation software for real time analysis of vital signs captured for elderly patients suffering from Arrhythmia. The developed system includes a suit of signal processing algorithms for the detection of severe cases of Arrhythmias in elderly patients. In particular, we used time frequency distributions and wavelets to estimate a number of features from ECG traces which are then used in classification. The performance of the system was tested on simulated data and the real data from MIT, and our own collected data with very satisfactory results. A questionnaire was conducted with physicians and health practitioners to study the feasibility of implementing a Tele-health system at the KFUPM Medical Center.",

abstract="Early Warning Score (EWS) system is specified to detect and predict patient deterioration in hospitals. This is achievable via monitoring patient's vital signs continuously and is often manually done with paper and pen. However, because of the constraints in healthcare resources and the high hospital costs, the patient might not be hospitalized for the whole period of the treatments, which has lead to a demand for in-home or portable EWS systems. Such a personalized EWS system needs to monitor the patient at anytime and anywhere even when the patient is carrying out daily activities. In this paper, we propose a self-aware EWS system which is the reinforced version of the existing EWS systems by using the Internet of Things technologies and the self-awareness concept. Our self-aware approach provides (i) system adaptivity with respect to various situations and (ii) system personalization by paying attention to critical parameters. We evaluate the proposed EWS system using a full system demonstration.",

These ICTs are in the form of smart systems, which are physical objects that are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, enabling them not only to intercommunicate with one another, but also to exchange information with people and react to their environment. This paper is on a low-cost technology customised to the South African environment to support ambient assisted living. The technology takes advantage of South Africa's digitalisation programme to provide broadband access in the support of AAL. Digital television as a gateway to internet access, wireless mesh networks for communication, motes for machine to machine communication and smart phones are the technologies supported in this architecture. A survey of AAL technologies was conducted and features of these systems that would be useful in defining our architecture identified. These features contribute to the development of an architecture for AAL. This research feeds into extending the body of knowledge on AAL technologies.",

Technologies like RFID, short-range wireless communication, real-time localization and sensor networks are becoming increasingly common and turning IoT into reality. It is expected to grow rapidly into a huge new market domain that may lead to disruptive changes in areas such as logistics, energy management and healthcare. Mobile and collaborative applications and services utilizing information processing and process support enabled by sensor data from a vast numbers of connected and cheap devices will change many markets when being made more easily available. New event-driven architectures (EDA) providing varied information to support collaborative decision-making enable more decisions to be made closer to the problem owner. The expected impacts of the combination of IoT and EDA on business and society are formidable. It also opens the possibility to take into account additional input from users to ensure shorter turnaround from ideas to new, personalized information systems support. Future business information systems will need to take this situation into account, addressing technological, methodological and conceptual challenges. This paper will focus on the latter, discussing in particular the potential role of model-based techniques and how to assess and improve the quality of models and modeling approaches in this setting.",

This is known as Internet of things (IoT). Scalability of the entire system increases in case of more devices in IoT system. So in IoT system, main challenges are to maintain scalability and throughput. To meet these challenges, various architectures are used for implementing IoT applications such as SOAP-based, RESTful, broker-based SOA architecture. While service-oriented architecture provides system integration, interoperability, business agility. Though service-oriented architecture is mainly used for implementing various IoT applications, it faces some challenges such as security, interoperability, and context awareness. Event-driven service-oriented architecture (EDSOA) is a new architectural style which is an extension of broker-based architecture and most suitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we have tried to cover all these architectures.",

abstract="The last two decades show that population is continuously and gradually aging; in Italy, the percentage of over-sixties has increased since 1980 by more than 50 {\%} while the over-eighties by more than 150 {\%}. Aging causes a consequent psycho-physical decline which in many cases requires specific care and precautions by relatives. However, as can be easily inferable from the percentage of elderly just shown, today the national health-care systems are not able to manage and take charge of all these elders. More and more seniors are choosing to live alone, with all the problems related to emergencies and urgencies cases that can occur due to poor health status related to aging (falls, cardiovascular events, neurological events). In this case, providing health-care initiates to have its new challenges. One of the worst possible case of emergency in elderly living alone is bad injury within the home without the possibility for seeking a help. This paper presents a work related to this issue; project SMARTA, focused on biomedical and environmental monitoring for the active aging. The project is based on the use of biomedical sensors and sensorized garments for health status and cardio-monitoring, and accelerometers fixed on the floor for activity and fall detection. All this sensors are integrated in a system that is used for monitoring elderly both indoor and outdoor during their daily life thanks also to the connection over the Internet.",

abstract="In this article, we present an approach to determine stress level in a non-invasive way using a smartphone as the only and sufficient source of data. We also present the idea of how to partly transfer such approach to the determination of the driving style, as aggressive driving is one of the causes of car accidents. For determination of the driving style a variety of methods are used including the preparation movements before maneuvers, identification of steering wheel angle, accelerator and brake pedal pressures, glance locations, facial expressions, speed, medical examinations before driving as well as filling out of the questionnaires after the journey. In our paper we present a methodology for estimation of potentially unsafe driving (in the meaning of more intensive acceleration and braking compared to average driving) and discuss how to estimate such unsafe driving before it actually takes place. We present sensors and data which can be used for these purposes. Such data include heart rate variability from chest belt sensor, behavioral and contextual data from smartphone, STAI short questionnaire to assess personal anxiety and anxiety as a state at certain moment, and initial interaction with car during opening and closing of the car doors. To determine intensive acceleration and braking we analyzed GPS data like speed, acceleration and also data from accelerometer inside the car to avoid interference in GPS-signal. Actually, our long term goals are to provide feedback about potentially unsafe driving in advance and thus strengthening driver's attention on the driving process before the start.",

Trueness of this hypothesis would imply that, instead of measuring a patient's BP in an invasive way, this could be indirectly measured by applying a wearable PPG sensor and by using the results of a regression analysis linking PPG and BP. Genetic Programming (GP) is well suited to find the relationship between PPG and BP, because it automatically evolves the structure of the most suitable explicit mathematical model for a regression task. In this paper, for the first time, some preliminary experiments on the use of GP to explicitly relate PPG and BP values have been performed. For both systolic and diastolic BP values, explicit nonlinear mathematical models have been achieved, involving an approximation error of less than 3 mmHg in both cases.",

From the many RTMS solutions currently on market, it was not found a specific or suitable solution for general Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). A list of requirements was gathered from one of the Portuguese LEAs, GNR (Guarda Nacional Republicana) to fully understand the generic daily challenges. Main requirements raised by GNR strive with that address issues like cost, data exchange security, bi-directional communication services, performance, network fault tolerance and user-friendly interfaces. This paper presents a RTMS solution and a service layer specifically conceived for LEAs. It will be shown that learning over risk assessment mappings may bring additional benefits to LEAs.

abstract="Amazing things have been achieved in a wide range of application domains by exploiting a multitude of small connected devices, defined as the Internet of Things. Managing of these devices and their resources is a task for the underlying Fog technology that enables building of smart and efficient applications. Currently, the Fog is not implemented to the extent that we can submit application requirements to a Fog provider, select returned resources and deploy an application on them. A widely adopted workaround is to deploy Cloud applications that exploit the functionality of IoT and Fog devices. Although Clouds provide virtually unlimited computation power, they could present a bottleneck and unnecessary communication overhead when a huge number of devices needs to be controlled, read or written to. Therefore, it is reasonable to formulate use cases that will exploit the Edge and Fog functionality and define a set of basic requirements for Fog providers.",

abstract="To overcome the ``one size fits all'' behavior of most search engines, in recent years a great deal of research has addressed the problem of defining techniques aimed at tailoring the search outcome to the user context to the aim of improving the quality of search. The main idea is to produce context-dependent and user-tailored search results. Search tasks are subjective, and often complex; the user-system interaction based on keyword-based querying and on the presentation of search results as a list of web pages ordered according to their estimated relevance is often unsatisfactory. In this paper a short overview of the main issues related to contextual search are outlined.",

abstract="The increasing ageing population worldwide imposes some new challenges to the society like the provision of dependable support while facing a shortage in the numbers of caregivers, increased health costs and the emergence of new diseases. As such there is a great demand for technologies that support the independent and safe living of the elderly and ensuring that they are not socially isolated. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have thus emerged to support the elderly people in their daily activities, while removing the need of caregivers being always physically present in order to look after the elderly. The current AAL systems are intelligent enough to take critical decisions in emergency situations like a fall, fire or a cardiac arrest, hence the elderly can live safely and independently. In this abstract, we describe our solution that aims at integrating all relevant functionalities of an AAL system, based on feedback collected from representative users. This work is carried out in the European Union project called CAMI (Artificially intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL).",

Various health problems have been attributed to either fall or lack of sleep in the context of elderly people. Falling and sleep problems on a long term basis could eventually lead to sharp deteriorate in health, poor state of health and high cost for covering their health care. In this paper a new accurate and convenient while cost-efficient implementation of a monitoring system is presented. The use of an accelerometer based system was utilized in this work. The targeted device fit for this implementation is a smart watch. The algorithm of both the fall detector and sleep monitor presented in this work have been implemented and tested on multiple subjects.

abstract="The concept of next generation networks as is currently consolidating within research and standards defining organizations foresees beside provision of higher flexibility and adaptability to different services' requirements also increased resource efficiency to enable affordable access in a sustainable way. To this end, a truly universal access has to be provided integrating multiple wireline, wireless, and cellular technologies to support residential and mobile entities of different size/shape/capability sets as is reflected by the variety of typical 5G use cases. Multiple logically separate networks (slices) shall be operated across the same infrastructure offering a performance and user experience meeting the diverse demand as exact as possible. This could include, beside traditional commercial operator services, a type of best effort connectivity to access e.g. urban community information and support daily life within a future smart city environment. This paper addresses a framework concept to integrate such a usage scenario within a future converged 5G system. Main focus of the reported exemplary results is on the issues of flexible service support (including varying mobility requirements) and efficient use of resources which seem to be most relevant for 5G success from a commercial point of view.",

Unfortunately, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet the requirements of critical applications that require low latency or enhanced privacy levels. The deployment of private cloud services on top of pervasive grids represent an interesting alternative to traditional cloud infrastructures, allowing the use of near-environment resources for IoT data analysis tasks. In this work we discuss the challenges associated with the deployment of IoT services over pervasive environments, and present a study case deployed over CloudFIT, a computing middleware for pervasive systems. Hence, we evaluate the behavior of a data-intensive application under volatility and heterogeneity constraints, bringing to light to the use of low-end devices that are usually located at the proximity to IoT sensors/actuators.",

Although LPWANs are already widely deployed the performance under real-life conditions of the communication system such as Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) radio technology has not been deeply studied yet. Smart City applications of IoT imply low energy consumption, high spectrum efficiency, and comprehensive security hence the range limits are very constrained and must be verified before deployment is started. In this work, authors verify UNB technology called SIGFOX and identify technological constraints. These constraints allow us to formulate a measurement methodology combining range measurements in an urban area to show transmission characteristics of SIGFOX technology. The subsequent evaluation of the technology using reference/commercially available SIGFOX hardware in real urban areas shows the impacts to possible applications of this novel UNB technology.",

abstract="This paper proposes an hybrid approach composed by Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to boost the upload speed of mobile users in low-bandwidth environments through a next generation Mobile Collaborative Community (MCC). The core idea is to use a high-bandwidth local communication system, like IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), in order to distribute data efficiently through mobile hosts; then, the distributed data may be sent from each mobile node to the original destination through their low-bandwidth mobile interface for wide area network communication. With our solution some drawbacks of MCC are faced. With the use of SDN we defined a flexible and easy-to-configure MCC system which operates in a transparent way for the end hosts. At the same time, the use of CPS creates a feedback for the system regarding the hosts channel status; this way the system is able to fully exploit the MCC potential by increasing the upload speed for both congested and non-congested scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency of our solution through experimental results obtained using the Mininet network emulator where POX and a Pyretic controller serve as a dynamic data repartition engine.",

Therefore based on previous experiences, a real-world WSN was developed, which addresses practical issues like water proofing, energy consumption, sensor deployment and visualization of the WSN state, but also provides a unique security concept, a interesting combination of sensors and sophisticated sensor data processing and analysis. The system was evaluated by examining firstly the sensors and the sensor processing algorithms and then conducting realistic field test.",

abstract="Recently major emphasis is exerted on development of effective tools and techniques for enriching IoT development environment. Typically an IoT application, for example a health monitoring application, not only requires domain knowledge of a programmer, but also similar knowledge from a medical practitioner, a sensor manufacturer, an infrastructure manager, etc. Such involvement of several experts makes the development process complex, resulting in escalation of time and cost of the effort. Model Driven Development (MDD) has been proposed as a development technique where such problem can be mitigated. This paper presents a system based on the MDD paradigm. As a part of the system, we present a work-flow designer framework, a visual drag and drop interface, where a developer can stitch various functional models recommended from a well-organized, annotated and crowd-sourced semantic repository of algorithms (from various domains), named as Algopedia, to quickly build a semantic workflow and in turn an end to end IoT application.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN), composed by small sensing nodes for acquisition, collection and analysis of data, are often employed for communication between Internet objects. However the WSAN have some problems such as sensors' energetic consumption and CPU load. The massive storage capacity, large processing speeds and the rapid elasticity makes Cloud Computing a very good solution to these problems. To efficiently manage devices' resources, and achieve efficient communication with various platforms (cloud, mobile), this paper proposes a middleware that allows flows of AI applications' execution to be transferred between a device and the cloud.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) transformed the Internet into a fully integrated future Internet by developing the way objects exchange data with users all over the world; IoT has an important impact on intelligent decisions made by devices interacting with humans in different applications domains. However, IoT suffers from many issues, most importantly the incapability to scale automatically depending on the overload made by the enormous number of users and/or massive volume of exchanged data. This paper gives, for the first time, a new way to analyze the scalability issue in the IoT systems. In order to promote the vision of an autonomic middleware-level scalability management for IoT systems based on cloud computing, we propose an enhancement of the architectural design of the monitoring components making our IoT system more scalable without any QoS symptom degradation. Using two proposed oriented scalability mechanisms, a series of experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of our approach, for different scenarios testbed. Generally, our results are better than that provided by the current solving approaches taken as reference.",

abstract="In conventional monitoring systems video previews from stationary cameras are overseen only by a human supervisor, who may easily overlook alarming events recorded by a camera. Because surveillance system must be reliable, its capabilities can be improved by applying computer vision algorithms to a video signal in order to detect objects in an automated fashion. Also its autonomy can be extended by the use of mobile robots capable of monitoring tight and occluded areas and by the use of smart cameras with integrated embedded systems. In this paper we introduce an architecture of the autonomous monitoring system based on object shape detection. Our approach is conformable with the concept of Internet of things. It consists of the set of smart objects with video sensors, controlled by the Shape Identification Cloud. Our work is aimed at building the real-time system efficient at reliable recognition of objects on the basis of their approximate shape and with the option to be used as a web service in a cloud. To monitor the environment the system uses mobots equipped with video sensors as well as surveillance cameras capable of remote position control. For object identification task we use the Query by Shape (QS) method which decomposes objects into simple graphical primitives like lines, circles, ellipses etc. and then it identifies them in a shape database.",

However, most of the measurements methods are connection based, i.e. sensors are connected to the body which is often complicated and requires personal assistance. This paper proposed a simple, low-cost and non-contact approach for measuring multiple physiological parameters using a web camera in real time. Here, the heart rate and respiration rate are obtained through facial skin colour variation caused by body blood circulation. Three different signal processing methods such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), independent component analysis (ICA) and Principal component analysis (PCA) have been applied on the colour channels in video recordings and the blood volume pulse (BVP) is extracted from the facial regions. HR, IBI and RR are subsequently quantified and compared to corresponding reference measurements. High degrees of agreement are achieved between the measurements across all physiological parameters. This technology has significant potential for advancing personal health care and telemedicine.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) applications by means of wireless sensor networks (WSN) produce large amounts of raw data. These data might formally be defined by following a semantic IoT model that covers data, meta-data, as well as their relations, or might simply be stored in a database without any formal specification. In both cases, using association rules as a data mining technique may result into inferring interesting relations between data and/or metadata. In this paper we argue that the context has not been used extensively for added value to the mining process. Therefore, we propose a different approach when it comes to association rule mining by enriching it with a context-aware ontology. The approach is demonstrated by hand of an application to WSNs for water quality monitoring. Initially, new ontology, its concepts and relationships are introduced to model water quality monitoring through mobile sensors. Consequently, the ontology is populated with quality data generated by sensors, and enriched afterwards with context. Finally, the evaluation results of our approach of including context ontology in the mining process are promising: new association rules have been derived, providing thus new knowledge not inferable when applying association rule mining simply over raw data.",

abstract="There is a global concern with the increasing number of patients at hospitals caused by population ageing and chronic diseases. Several studies indicated the need to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. In this context, a promising trend in healthcare is to move medical checks routines from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric), but to make it possible we need Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies and platforms to enable remote health monitoring. The application of IoT in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of IoT-based healthcare applications, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve patients' wellness, as well as a better application of the government's financial resources. Thus, based on this context, this paper aims to propose an IoT-based healthcare platform for the remote monitoring of patients in critical condition. It involves embedding sensors and actuators in patients, physicians, clinical staff, medical equipment and physical spaces in order to monitor, track and alert.",

abstract="The Patient Monitoring System (PMS) is an essential medical system to check the vital signs of patients for 24 hours. However, the wire-line connection makes patients uncomfortable and makes it inconvenient for medical doctors and nurses to manage the system. Recently, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) has been spotlighted as a promising wireless communication technology for the devices operating on, in or around the human body. Thus, WBAN could be a candidate technology to resolve the connection problem of the PMS. However, existing WBAN technologies, especially the IEEE 802.15.4 and the IEEE 802.15.6, have some limitations to support the PMS in the viewpoint of time sensitivity and energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes an Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm (ASA), which supports a fast retransmission mechanism through adaptive retransmission slot allocation within the superframe. In addition, the ASA piggybacks the synchronization and association control data into existing ACK in order to save wireless resources. Through the performance comparison, the proposing ASA reduces the average latency, enhances energy efficiency, and minimizes the average link occupancy compared to the IEEE 802.15.4 and the IEEE 802.15.6 technologies.",

abstract="Today the most significant public health problem is Heart Failure (HF). There are a lot of raw medical data available to healthcare organizations in the form of structured and unstructured datasets, but the need is to analyze this data to get information and to make intelligent decisions. By using data mining, classification tool on a real dataset of cardiac patients we propose a model which classified these patients into four major classes. This model will help to identify the risk of HF and patients who have no HF signs but structural irregularities. We can also identify the patients having HF signs and irregularities and those having the critical stage of HF. This paper provides a detailed summary of modern strategies for management and analysis of HF patients by classes (1 to 4) that have appeared in the past few years.",

The process from suspicious to accusation is very difficult to achieve. It must configure very strong evidences.

Besides that, this subject it's highly sensitive because there are legal aspects to deal with such as: the patient privacy, paternity issues, medical confidentiality, among others. We propose a Child Abuses critical knowledge monitor system model that addresses this problem. This decision support system is implemented with a multiple scientific domains: to capture of tokens from clinical documents from multiple sources; a topic model approach to identify the topics of the documents; knowledge management through the use of ontologies to support the critical knowledge sensibility concepts and relations such as: symptoms, behaviors, among other evidences in order to match with the topics inferred from the clinical documents and then alert and log when clinical evidences are present.

This work performed is based on the four phases, which are first phase is raw data and after data processing using statistical features such as mean and standard deviation. The second phase is the sum of hertz, the third is the sum of hertz divided by the number of hertz, and last is the sum of hertz divided by total hertz. We are using five attributes that are patients, class, domain, location, and hertz. The data were classified using WEKA. The results showed that BayesNet gave a consistent result for all the phases from multilayer perceptron and K-Means. However, K-Mean gave the highest result in the first phase.

However, the depiction of customer/user requirements in the early stage of design stands difficult due to their subjective nature and the separation between the user and the designer. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the definition of a new modular digital toolbox based upon mixed reality system and kansei engineering techniques. The hardware consists in modular Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), custom made by 3D printing and powered by a 3D game engine. The interactive content is displayed in mixed reality, simultaneously to the user and the designer. Kansei data are collected through questionnaires and psychophysical measurements, during multiple collaboration phases. The modularity of the system allows the evaluation of various TUIs, 3D content behaviours and the best fitting type of display.",

abstract="Recently, more and more sensor network research is carried out in the area of remote and mobile health systems (mHealth) or Telemedicine applications. In these applications the sensors are centered in or on the proximity of the human body thereby forming a network called Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) that is uniquely important for consideration. Hot problems currently researched in this network include reliability and energy efficiency of routing protocols.  In this paper we present the analysis of three prominent routing protocols AODV, DSR and DSDV, based on the key characteristics of the WBAN using IEEE 802.15.4 MAC Protocol. In our experiments, packet delivery ratio and average end-end delay were used as the measure for the communication reliability and energy savings efficiency, while considering the mobility of the nodes, network communication range and the number of nodes. Based on the experimental analysis, both AODV and DSR protocols have good reliability, while DSDV performed very poorly with over 90 percent packet losses largely due to its high routing table overhead. Furthermore, in energy savings efficiency, DSR and AODV had similar performance while DSDV performed a little poorer.",

abstract="Research in the area of process modeling and analysis has a long-established tradition. There are quite few formalism for capturing processes, which are also accompanied by a number of optimization approaches. We introduce a novel approach, which employs semantics, for process annotation and analysis. In particular, we distinguish between target processes and current processes. Target process models describe how a process should ideally run and define a framework for current processes, which in contrast, capture how processes actually run in real-life use cases. In some cases, current processes do not match the target process models and can even overhaul them. Therefore, one is interested in the similarity between the defined target process model and current processes. The comparisons can consider different characteristics of processes such as service quality measures and dimensions. Current solutions perform process mining methods to discover hidden structures or try to infer knowledge about processes by using specific ontologies. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture and formalize processes, employing semantics and devising strategies and similarity measures that exploit the semantic representation to calculate similarities between target and current processes. As part of the similarity analysis, we consider different service qualities and dimensions in order to determine how they influence the target process models.",

These devices can be used in a number of medical, vehicular, aviation, military and smart cities applications. A plethora of sensitive data is transmitted in insecure wireless or wired environments whilst adversaries are eager to eavesdrop, modify or destroy sensed data invading the privacy of user-centric CPSs. This work presents an overview and analysis of the most effective attacks, privacy challenges and mitigation techniques for preserving the privacy of users and their interconnected devices. In order to preserve privacy, a privacy-level model is proposed in which users have the capability of assigning different privacy levels based on the variety and severity of privacy challenges and devices' capabilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of specific CPSs at different privacy-levels in terms of time and consumed energy in an experimental test-bed that we have developed.",

abstract="Telehealth has been developed and successfully applied in clinical practices, gained a strong interest and demonstrated its usefulness for medical diagnosis, treatments and rehabilitation worldwide. The advent of high speed communication technology and complex signal processing techniques, and recent advancements in cloud and cognitive computing, has created a new wave of opportunities for delivering remote healthcare applications and services, where the cost-effective diagnosis and treatment solutions as well as healthcare services are important and need to be deployed widely. Nevertheless, there is still a significant challenge in fully adopting this technology due to asymmetry among the healthcare centers, hospitals and the user-ends, especially in developing countries. This paper provides an overview of the telehealth, then to addresses the possible telehealth technologies and applications that could be applied to improve the healthcare service performance, with the focus on the developing countries. The incorporation of different technologies in telehealth including, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and cognitive computing, medical image processing and effective encoding is introduced and discussed. Finally, the possible research directions, challenges for the efficient telehealth, and potential research and technology collaborations are outlined.",

abstract="Due to the uncertainty of what actual adaptations will be performed at run time, verifying adaptive systems at design time may lead to limited results or may even be infeasible. Run-time verification techniques have been proposed to cope with this uncertainty. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to use model checking (an important verification technique) at run time in order to verify the expected properties of adaptive systems. Given a system specification and expected system properties, a model checker determines whether or not the specification satisfies its properties in the presence of self-adaptation. One key concern is the generally high resource needs of model checking, which may prohibit its use on resource- and power-constrained devices, such as smart-phones or Internet-of-Things devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a cloud-based framework that delivers model checking as a service (MCaaS). MCaaS offloads computationally intensive model checking tasks to the cloud, thereby offering verification capabilities on demand. Adaptive systems running on any kind of connected device may take the advantages of model checking at run time by invoking the MCaaS service. To dynamically allocate the required cloud resources (CPU and memory), we employ machine learning to estimate the resource usage of an actual model checking task at run time. As proof of concept, we implement and validate the approach for the case of probabilistic model checking, which facilitates verifying typical properties such as reliability.",

abstract="Stroke is one of the major problems in medical and healthcare that can cause severe disability and death of patients especially for older population. Rehabilitation plays an important role in stroke therapy. However, most of the rehabilitative exercises are monotonous and tiring for the patients. For a particular time, they can easily get bored in doing these exercises. The role of patient's motivation in rehabilitation is vital. Motivation and rehabilitative outcomes are strongly related. Digital games are promising to help stroke patients to feel motivated and more engaged in rehabilitative training through motivational gameplay. Most of the commercial games available in the market are not well-designed for stroke patients and their motivational needs in rehabilitation. This study aims at understanding the motivational requirements of stroke patients in doing rehabilitative exercises and living in a post-stroke life. Based on the findings from the literature review, we report that there are many factors that can influence the stroke patients' level of motivation such as social functioning, patient-therapist relationship, goal-setting, and music. These findings are insightful and useful for ideating and designing interactive motivation-driven games for stroke patients. The motivational factors of stroke patients in rehabilitation may help the game designers to design motivation-driven game contexts, contents, and gameplay. Moreover, these findings may help not only game designers but also healthcare professionals who concern stroke patient's motivation in rehabilitative context.",

abstract="A virtual patient navigator is a web/mobile application that helps patients with lung cancer diagnosis reduce their anxiety and uncertainties. In particular, lung cancer patients easily become overwhelmed when having to manage information overload, many appointments with different instructions and locations, and recommendations on how to improve their lifestyle. Existing solutions such as paper-based patient navigators provide much reliable information but are limited in terms of dynamic updates and do not provide opportunities for interactions between care providers and patients. In this paper, we propose a new web-based, mobile, and user-friendly virtual patient navigator application named Care Ami, which incorporates the information found in an existing paper-based navigator along with new features such as remote updates to personal care paths and calendars, personalized navigation guidance, sharing of symptom/medication information, and peer group support. The architecture and main features of this application are presented. Based on the identified requirements, Care Ami compares favorably against related work and solutions.",

abstract="Pervasive computing environments and technologies have attracted much attention in the health-care field recently. The application of pervasive computing technologies in the public health and medicine caused the emergence of pervasive healthcare as a new concept. Using pervasive healthcare, patients are able to access to the health and medical services at anytime and anywhere. However selecting the most trusted service provider among available ones is a challenging task. In this paper, we have proposed a new model for pervasive health-care systems in which the patient smart device not only uses its own past experiences but also learns from its neighbors (friends) in a health-care social network to update the trust of available providers using a CLA (cellular learning automata). Comparing the proposed method with existing recommendation based methods shows that it is more scalable, efficient and appropriate for dynamic environments without sacrificing the precision.",

The aim of this paper is to investigate the music's and colour's influence on the brain activity, mainly the increase on the concentration level noting the help to students enrolled in distance-learning programs. A LabVIEW application is developed in order to better monitor and do the spectral analyses and statistics calculations of the music and/or colour induced brain waves.",

abstract="The advances in IoT and wearable sensors enable long term monitoring, which promotes earlier and more reliable diagnosis in health care. This position paper proposes a probabilistic method to address the challenges in handling longitudinal sensor signals that are subject to stochastic uncertainty in health monitoring. We first explain how a longitudinal signal can be transformed into a Markov model represented as a matrix of conditional probabilities. Further, discussions are made on how the derived models of signals can be utilized for anomaly detection and classification for medical diagnosis.",

abstract="Pathological shaking of the body or extremities is widely known and might occur at chronic diseases e.g. Parkinson. The rhythmical shaking, also known as tremor, can be such intense that extremities are flapping. Under certain circumstances, healthy people also show a shivering and shaking of their body. For example, humans start to shiver whenever it is too cold or if feelings such as stress or fear become dominant. Some wearable devices that are in direct contact to the body, such as smartwatches or smartglasses, provide a sensing functionality of acceleration force that is sufficient to detect the tremor of the wearer. The tremor varies in frequency and intensity and can be identified, by applying detection algorithms and signal filtering. Former works figured that all endotherms show muscle vibrations. These vibrations occur in the condition of sleeping as well as when being awake, or in unconsciousness. Furthermore, the vibrations are also present when subjects are physically active, emotionally stressed, or absolutely relaxed. The vibration itself varies in structure, amplitude, and frequency. This paper shows that these muscle vibrations are measureable by acceleration sensors attached to the user, and provides an outlook to new applications in the future. It also proves that custom mobile devices are able to detect body and muscle vibration and should motivate designers to develop new applications and treatment opportunities.",

Today new digital technologies vastly diminish boundaries between virtual and physical world. Cross-reality design supported with recent mobile and context aware computing, gradually changed the concept of user interaction and moved it more toward usage of heterogeneous contexts, pervasive computing technologies, and multimodal spatial perception and transformed our living surroundings into smart environments, traditional living object into smart living objects. Ubiquitous computing vision implies more than ever to our lives. In order to make all these changes more human-centered in this paper we are investigated the cognitive and metaphorical aspects of future interface design strategies which could enhance user experience and ideas acceptance, communicated through multimodal interactions. In this paper we are presenting three tangible interfaces that we have developed for design and research purposes and results we collected during their public exposure. Hopefully, the results will give us sufficient insights for further investigations in the field of smart living environments and smart objects development.

abstract="With the rising interest in internet connected devices and sensor networks, better known as the Internet of Things, data streams are becoming ubiquitous. Integration and processing of these data streams is challenging. Semantic Web technologies are able to deal with the variety of data but are not able to deal with the velocity of the data. An emerging research domain, called stream reasoning, tries to bridge the gap between traditional stream processing and semantic reasoning. Research in the past years has resulted in several prototyped RDF Stream Processors, each of them with its own features and application domain. They all cover querying over RDF streams but lack support for complex reasoning. This paper presents how adaptive stream processing and context-awareness can be used to enhance semantic reasoning over streaming data. The result is a federated context-aware architecture that allows to leverage reasoning capabilities on data streams produced by distributed sensor devices. The proposed solution is stated by use cases in pervasive health care and smart cities.",

abstract="The increasing emergence of social and healthcare costs due to constant ageing trends of the world population requires to find new solutions to support and prolong people's independence within the everyday living environments. A research pool among Italian universities, industries and public agencies for the management of services to the person is developing a project called Habitat, aiming at elaborating and testing a platform based on the Internet of Things, thence enabling to create supportive and reconfigurable environments by implementing, improving or re-designing some of the objects of everyday use. The research methodology will be that of the User Centred Design, while the design tool for giving solutions to the end-users' needs is the Quality Function Deployment (QFD). This article wants to investigate the role of design research within the Habitat project, and it will focus on the definition of the characteristics and contributions of design methods applied to a research project aimed at developing useful innovation for real users by a multidisciplinary team.",

abstract="Many current context-aware systems only react to the current situation and context changes as the occur. In order to anticipate to future situations and exhibit proactive behavior, these systems should also be aware of their future context. Since predicted context is uncertain and can be wrong, applications need to be able to assess the quality of the predicted context information. This allows applications to make a well-informed decision whether to act on the prediction or not. In this paper, we present prediction quality metrics to evaluate the probability of future situations. These metrics are integrated in a structured prediction component development methodology, which is illustrated by a health care application scenario. The metrics and the methodology address the needs of the developer aiming to build context-aware applications that realize proactive behavior with regard to past, present and future context.",

This is especially true in the clinical field, where omitting significant information can have considerable implications for diagnosis and treatment in general. History taking from patients represents a crucial phase for physicians in order to evaluate the patient's wellness status and to perform correct diagnoses. As a routine procedure, it is a time-consuming and not so appealing obligation. In this paper we present a smart approach to anamnesis in order to gain as much data as possible and to have high quality information by avoiding any misunderstandings or errors. The approach is mainly based on the possibility to capture data directly at the source increasing the overall effectiveness of physician's time and of the visit itself. Its feasibility has been evaluated in the context of a complex clinical domain: maternal and fetal assessment during pregnancy.",

abstract="It appears that interest in the Internet of things (IoT) has recently reached its peak, with a great deal of focus from both the private and public sectors. IoT, a technology that enables the exchange of data through linkage among all objects surrounding the user, can create new services. Data communication among objects is not limited to personal information, but can also deliver different data types, such as sensing information collected from the surrounding environment. When such data is collected and used maliciously by an attacker, it is more vulnerable to threats than in conventional network environments. Security of all data transmitted in the IoT environment is therefore essential for preventing attacks. In IoT network composed of many sensors, group communication is required. However, it is difficult to apply the conventional cipher algorithm to IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a method to forward each group key to a group member in a decentralized way using proxy re-encryption. The proposed scheme is best suited for large-scale dynamic IoT networks without a central network controller.",

Quad-tree is a commonly used spatial index which divides the space region into four small regions recursively, until the number of data objects in each region is within the given range. Based on the research of the traditional quad-tree, a new spatial index based on dynamic quad-tree regional division is proposed in this paper. The new index structure will first carry on clustering in the queried region, and then chose the biggest covering area to carry on quad-tree partition for each cluster. The construction of the tree is simple and it can save the storage space and improve the query efficiency by dynamically moving one quad-tree to index data objects in the entire region.",

IoT enable interconnection of embedded devices capable of running application like smart grid, smart traffic control, remote health monitoring etc. As the IoT devices can be connected virtually as well as physically, cyber attacks are likely to become a major threat. An attacker who have an access to the on-board network connecting IoT devices or appliances can spy on people, can inject malicious code into these embedded devices creating serious security concerns. In this work, we propose a framework to monitor security threats possible on IoT devices. The framework consists of several modules like data capture, anomaly detector and alert generator. The data capture module collects the application level data, transport and network headers of the traffic that goes into the IoT device. The anomaly detector module uses a signature based approach to detect threats. The proposed framework is tested on a testbed comprising of Arduino boards with Wiznet Ethernet shield as the IoT device communicate with Samsung Android smart-phone over a bridge connected through WiFi. We ran SNORT Intrusion Detector on the bridge with rules for generating alerts for intrusion.",

As for the technical procedures to carry out the work, the case study was used from the context of the company that produces frequency inverters where the project is being executed. To achieve the main objective was instantiated a ``soft processor'' in FPGA and specified and implemented scalar control algorithms (and helper functions) that allowed validating the hardware implementation.

abstract="Product lifecycle management (PLM) systems maintain amongst others the specifications and designs of product, process and resource artefacts and thus serve as the basis for realizing the concept of Virtual Manufacturing, and play a vital role in shortening the leadtimes for the engineering processes. Design of new products requires numerous experiments and test-runs of new facilities that delays the product release and causes high costs if performed in the real world. Virtualization promises to reduce these costs by simulating the reality. However, the results of the simulation must predict the real results to be useful. This is called virtual confidence. We propose a knowledge base approach to capture and maintain the virtual confidence in simulation results. To do so, the provenance of results of real, experimental and simulated processes are recorded and linked via confirmation objects.",

abstract="Organizations are increasingly focused on using data to make their operational business processes more intelligent and reactive. Reactive performance monitoring consists of automating strategic decisions into rule-based actions when appropriate. Often there is a response gap, where there is unnecessary latency or missing detail, as the mapping between the strategic, the operational and the analytical is complex, labor intensive and not clearly defined. This paper presents an OLAP-modeled rule environment that leverages Complex Event Processing (CEP), multi-dimensionally modeled On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases and Business Process Management (BPM) to provide reactive performance monitoring. We use two case studies to evaluate our proposed architecture for an OLAP-modeled rule environment. The first case study prototyped the environment using IBM PMQ, while the second prototyped the environment using QuickForms and a custom-built OLAP rule engine. Predictive modeling, traditional rule engines, and our OLAP rule engine are compared in terms of their support for reactive performance monitoring.",

Abnormal activity detection is a particularly important task in the field, since the services should be immediately provided in such cases. Otherwise the elder people may be in danger. The existing approaches to this problem use some basic living patterns of the elder people, e.g. mobility per day, to detect abnormal activities. However, the detail abnormal activities in various specific situations cannot be detected, e.g., whether there is some abnormal activity when the elder people go to toilet, sleeps or eats something. To solve the above problem, in the paper, we propose a situation-aware abnormality detection system based on SVDD for the elder people.

In spite of their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based respiration monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue treatment and diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote services are designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database.

Due to the complex layout of large buildings, rapid evacuation is making way finding difficult. The need for exit signs that take into account when this should be evident, redirecting individuals to not only an exit but rather a practical and optimal way out in an evolving emergency situation has facilitated the improvement of another era of cutting edge signage. Conventional signage cannot adapt to changing conditions because it only conveys single and passive information, and displays static content with limited user interactivity. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a dynamic active emergency signage system architecture `DSS-SL' based of SDN.

abstract="The development of the Internet and cloud computing has set up a matured environment for developing and deploying big data services. The main objective of requirements engineering for big data is to capture big data service users' needs and provider's capabilities, and to identify value added service use cases for big data technology in a given organizational context. Major objectives may include: collect real-time data about the world, search for useful information in large data sets, gain insights about given problems by data analytics, predict possible trend of interesting subjects, and make decisions for the next immediate actions. In this paper, we propose a big data service requirements analysis framework, which aims to provide useful guidelines for eliciting service requirements, selecting the right services architectures and evaluate the available technological services implementations. For services under operation, we suggest data analysis to service logs to elicit user's changing needs, to evaluate the run-time service performance and to check compliance to general standards and domain-specific regulations. Example cases from eHealth and industry 4.0 are discussed to illustrate the proposed service requirements framework.",

abstract="In this paper, we present ant intelligence routing algorithm (AIRA), an adaptive, energy efficient and multiple-path protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. The primary goals of the protocol design are energy efficiency and self-organization without compromising throughput. AIRA reduces energy consumption by enabling low-duty-cycle operation and clocking neighbors to power of their radios to avoid unnecessary listening and interference during data transmission in a multihop network through adaptive sleeping technique. This greatly improves energy efficiency. It supports self-organization of individual nodes and reduces control overheads by using data packets themselves to maintain an established route for communication. Finally, AIRA applies synchronized sleeping technique to improve energy efficiency of the entire network. In an extensive set of simulations, we compare our routing algorithm with a state-of-the-art algorithm, and show that it gets better performance over a range of different scenarios.",

abstract="Ambient intelligence technologies have the objective to improve the quality of life of people in daily living, by providing user-oriented services and functionalities. Many of the services and functionalities provided in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) require the user position and identity to be known, and thus user localization and identification are two prerequisites of utmost importance. In this work we focus our attention on human indoor localization. Our aim is to investigate how Received Signal Strength (RSS) based localization can be performed in an easy way by exploiting common Internet of Things (IoT) communication networks, which could easily integrate with custom networks for AAL purposes. We thus propose a plug and play solution where the Beacon Nodes (BNs) are represented by smart objects located in the house, while the Unknown Node (UN) can be any smart object held by the user. By using real data from different environments (i.e., with different disturbances), we provide a one-slope model and test localization performances of three different algorithms.",

abstract="As one of important technologies of Internet of Things, Multimedia Wireless Sensor Network(MWSN) has been widely used in all industries. MWSN needs higher bandwidth in MAC layer than traditional WSN. Although AMCP procotol works well in traditional WSN, it is difficult to meet the requirement of multiple-hop MWSN due to its half-duplex mode. Hence, a full-duplex mode is introduced based on the assumption that each node has two radios, and a high-speed multi-hop AMCP algorithm is proposed in this paper. Several data frames can be transmitted after each channel negotiation succeeds to reduce the frequency of channel competition. Simulation results show that the novel algorithm increases 203{\%} compared with that of tranditional AMCP.",

abstract="The healthcare sector faces important challenges in evaluating and improving its services to meet desired targets, patient needs, and government requirements. In particular, the introduction of a new process or information system in healthcare is a challenging task, especially in the absence of mature practices for requirements engineering and process modeling. Most of today's healthcare process research is focused on mappings between existing processes and new ones without considering the different needs of multiple stakeholders and the satisfaction of organizational goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) approach that highlights integration opportunities of each new activity into current processes. AbPI exploits the User Requirements Notation (URN) language to model, analyze, and estimate the potential impact of each integration opportunity on performance objectives, organizational goals, and stakeholder satisfaction. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach with an illustrative example (increasing patient satisfaction in an Emergency Room). Preliminary results show the feasibility of the approach as well as many potential benefits over existing approaches.",

Accordingly, five elements include (1) group learning, (2) problem solving, (3) interdisciplinary learning, (4) project management, and (5) facilitation. These main elements show PBL is a suitable learning environment to develop individual creativity and to stimulate interplay of individual and group creativity.

Serious and pervasive games can change people's attitudes and can promote healthy behavior. However, both concepts are rarely combined and the integration of both concepts is insufficiently explored. We present a user study (n = 64) of an Exergame for AAL environments with the research foci performance and acceptance. Age is the predominant factor for performance, while the intention to use is determined by gaming frequency. Neither technical self-efficacy nor age had considerable influence on these measures. However, the interaction with the game had a considerable positive effect on the participant's perceived health and pain. The study shows that Exergames in AAL environments are a viable solution to support the autonomy and independence of people in an aging society.",

Energy harvesting facilities provide an attractive solution to this problem. The potential of the energy harvesting wireless sensor networks can be properly applied if the corresponding efficient network operations protocols will be implemented.

Excited intermolecular transport of protons, electrons and other quantum carriers could create communication channels inside a molecular network. We suggest that such channels could be analyzed by means of electron capture dissociation reactions of a protonated peptide, protein or a DNA to reveal the intramolecular pathways of mobile carrier motion in an isolated dehydrated molecule. In general, initial processing stage in a nano-device with a molecular film consists of a target direct activation followed by energy transport from target excitations into a surface molecular film which produces an indirect activation. We analyzed selected indirect molecular excitations produced by a metal or a semiconductor target directly activated by means of a radiofrequency electromagnetic field. Further processing stage after the activation consists of molecular relaxation and transportation phenomena providing nano-electromagnetic field, molecular flow, and communication.",

In this paper, we present the design and development of an activity-based framework aimed at enabling the real-time viewing of bidirectional activity states between the elderly and their caregivers. This framework seeks to overcome the limitations of existing ambient displays deployed in AAL settings, which are in most cases unidirectional and confined to the homes of its users. Our bidirectional activity-based framework, is based on an extensive literature review, expert advice and user feedback, which informed the design decisions about the product features and functionality.

abstract="In recent days, physiological sensing using smartphones is gaining attention everywhere for preventive health-care. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage approach for robust heart rate (HR) calculation from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, captured using smartphones. Firstly, Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) based adaptive filter is used to clean up the noisy PPG signal. Then, heart rate is calculated from the frequency spectrum, which is further fine-tuned using different interpolation techniques. Experimental results, show that the overall HR calculation improves significantly due to the proposed 2-stage approach.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) visualizes future, in which the objects of everyday life are equipped with sensor technology for digital communication. IoT supports the concept of smart city, which aims to provide different services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. The important application of IoT is Structural Strength Recognition (SSR). This approach is becoming popular to increase the safety of buildings and human life. Proper maintenance of historical buildings requires continuous monitoring and current conditions of it. Sensor nodes are used to collect data of these historical buildings or large structures. Structural strength recognition covers huge geographical area and it requires continuous monitoring of it. It involves more energy consumption during these activities. Hence, there is need for efficient energy management technique. Clustering is one of the important techniques for energy management in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). It helps in reducing the energy consumed in wireless data transmission. In this paper, SSR system is designed with efficient clustering algorithm for wide network and also finds out optimum number of clusters.",

abstract="Aviation is a high competitive industry where actors should be first adopters for leading market or following adopters to survive. Traditional manufacturing techniques pass into the background, manufacturing systems require using additive technologies for rapid adaptation to current demand and reduction of production cycle duration. Many large mechanic and aircraft engineering companies have already adopted additive manufacturing technologies in their future production strategy. The general concept of 3D printer on the basis of e-manufacturing principles is aimed at integration of computer models of physical objects and processes. This change requires a deep transformation into enterprise business model, affecting either core or support activities. For instance, additive manufacturing could also change product lifecycle and supply chain management practices. This paper aims to identifying how these new technologies could improve support activities for aeronautical industry? Results show that additive manufacturing triggers a paradigm shift for aircraft lifecycle management and enable lean and agile practices for supply chain management.",

Two rather distinct, but at the same time collaborating, domains are the ones of computer science and medicine; the former offers significant aid towards a more efficient understanding of the latter's research trends. Still, the process of meaningfully analyzing and understanding medical information and data is a tedious one, bound to several challenges. One of them is the efficient utilization of contextual information in the process leading to optimized, context-aware data analysis results. Nowadays, researchers are provided with tools and opportunities to analytically study medical data, but at the same time significant and rather complex computational challenges are yet to be tackled, among others due to the humanistic nature and increased rate of new content and information production imposed by related hardware and applications. So, the ultimate goal of this position paper is to provide interested parties an overview of major contextual information types to be identified within the medical data processing framework.",

Cloud computing has simultaneously revolutionized business and government sectors by stretching its arms in every possible field, from not only to Information communication technology to medical advancements to a more diverse agriculture field which was untouched by technology for a decade. Cloud computing enlightens path for another dimension of computing which is expected to rise even more than mobile computing, i.e., Internet of Things (IOT) or internet of everything. As new dimensions are being added up to the cloud domain every day this gives a window to hackers and intruders to breach the doors. The security problem is amplified under cloud computing as it introduces new problem domains. One of the major problem domain identified is data security, where security of user's data is the utmost priority. Providing privacy to the user and the data stored by the user is to be ensured by the cloud service provider.

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) platforms are seen as a viable way for managing healthcare costs in an ever aging first world population. One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost ``off-the-shelf'' technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial ``observations from the field'' taken during the USEFIL AAL platform's integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

abstract="An ongoing challenge in our days is to lower the impact on the quality of life caused by dysfunctionality through individual support. With the background of an aging society and continuous increases in costs for care, a holistic solution is needed. This solution must integrate individual needs and preferences, locally available possibilities, regional conditions, professional and informal caregivers and provide the flexibility to implement future requirements. The proposed model is a result of a common initiative to overcome the major obstacles and to center a solution on individual needs caused by dysfunctionality.",

abstract="Early detection of cognitive and physical status deterioration for elderly people has been much dependent on gait analysis lately. However, much of the recent literature focuses on gait analysis methodologies exploiting average speed. This presents a serious constraint when gait analysis is supposed to drive context aware applications. To this end, this work applies density based clustering algorithms on gait and trajectory IoT data recorded from real senior homes (``on the wild''). The indoor analytics client analyzes high density regions rendered from locations in real senior homes facilitated by IoT technology consisting of events describing the seniors' position. These are collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client taking into account the available processing resources and configuring itself to deliver the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained by analyzing a whole week's data in two seniors' homes. The algorithm performance and accuracy with respect to the number of points included in the analysis are presented and discussed.",

Thus, special technical means of protection should safeguard critical DNA data and create trust for patients and consumers of lifestyle services. In particular an interesting research challenge is to design secure operations on DNA sequences in the encrypted domain that allow a person to engage into a DNA-based service and obtain required (medical) answers without revealing his/her DNA.

According to forecasts, more than 7 trillion wireless devices are expected to become networked by 2020. The traffic models for networks with great number of sensors and RFIDs should be studied well. This paper studies USN traffic models. The study results show that the traffic flows for fixed and mixed fixed/mobile sensor nodes are of the self-similar nature with middle level of self-similarity in both cases. The traffic flow for reconfiguration and signaling is of self-similar nature with high level of self-similarity. The Hurst parameter mean value estimations are determined for different scenarios.",

In this chapter, we adopt a probabilistic approach that presents a robust and generalized framework for performing in-network processing in order to improve the overall data collection and monitoring process in a sensor network. The effectiveness and applicability of the framework under investigation in a diverse set of networking environments that present different constraints, limitations, and physical characteristics are demonstrated via modeling and simulation, under different traffic loads. Furthermore, different ways of dynamically varying and configuring parameters related to the aggregation process are investigated and evaluated for different applications and networking environments (terrestrial and underwater sensor networks).",

abstract="We propose that access to data and knowledge be controlled through fine-grained, user-specified explicitly represented policies. Fine-grained policies allow stakeholders to have a more precise level of control over who, when, and how their data is accessed. We propose a representation for policies and a mechanism to control data access within a fully distributed system, creating a secure environment for data sharing. Our proposal provides guarantees against standard attacks, and ensures data security across the network. We present and justify the goals, requirements, and a reference architecture for our proposal. We illustrate through an intuitive example how our proposal supports a typical data-sharing transaction. We also perform an analysis of the various potential attacks against this system, and how they are countered. Additionally, we provide details of a proof-of-concept prototype which we used to refine our mechanism.",

It is a platform of information distribution that focus on the status of patients' health and is meant to be easily accessed by health care professionals. It also supports the automatic collection of vital patient data by using Arduino microcontrollers, medical sensors and wearables. In addition, it performs an automatic detection process of anomalies in a patient's condition in real time and sends alerts to the health care providers in charge, through the use of software agents. We conducted a case study in a Brazilian hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In this experiment, a medical team used our platform.

abstract="To meet the needs related to detecting dust, this paper describes a system based on ZigBee communication technology, which allows for smart real-time monitoring of the concentrations of dust in system fields. The system is mainly composed of a particulate matter sensor module, data acquisition and processing module, and a ZigBee communication module. ZigBee communication technology replaces traditional monitoring systems that transmit data by wired cable or via a mobile communication base station. The particulate-matter-detecting sensor uses a PD4NS dust sensor based on the principles of photoelectricity and particle counting. It can detect particles whose size is greater than 1 $\mu$m. Its maximum detection range is up to 8,000 pcs/283 mL with measured results at Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Currently, the system obtains signals sampled by the PD4NS dust sensor and handled by a microcontrol unit (MCU) and then data are sent to the monitoring center (PC) via a ZigBee communication network. The system can be applied to similar monitor systems based on the Internet of Things because of its simple structure, low cost, and high movability.",

In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for brain waves and, encryption and decryption time of cipher algorithms. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data. For experimental results, when using our system the concentration is 80 [{\%}] from 0 [s] to 400 [s]. But, for 400 [s] to 1000 [s], concentration is decreased. In the case of not using our system, concentration is almost the same (about 40 [{\%}]) from 0 [s] to 1000 [s].

Genetic algorithms are a well-known tool for finding approximate solutions to various optimization and searching problems. More specifically, we present a secure solution for solving the subset cover problem which is formulated by a binary integer linear programming (BIP) problem (i.e. a linear programming problem, where the solution is expected to be a 0-1 vector). Our solution is based on secure multi-party computation. We give a privacy definition inspired from semantic security definitions and show how a secure computation system based on secret sharing satisfies this definition. Our solution also achieves security against timing attacks, as the execution of the secure algorithm on two different inputs is indistinguishable to the observer. We implement and benchmark our solution on the SHAREMIND secure computation system. Performance tests show that our privacy-preserving implementation achieves a 99.32{\%} precision within 6.5 seconds on a BIP problem of moderate size. As an application of our algorithm, we consider the problem of securely outsourcing risk assessment of an end user computer environment.",

abstract="While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overload the bandwidth of a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Therefore, they can be used to launch ``physical'' denial-of-service attacks (PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the ``physical bandwidth'' of a CPS. In this paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted by malware for a PDoS attack. In order to model the recruitment of bots, we develop a ``Poisson signaling game,'' a signaling game with an unknown number of receivers, which have varying abilities to detect deception. Then we use a version of this game to analyze two mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet recruitment. Equilibrium results indicate that (1) defenders can bound botnet activity, and (2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This work provides a quantitative foundation for proactive PDoS defense.",

abstract="Movement detection in Internet of Things (IoTs) has been widely used in many fields, such as valuables monitoring, safety protection and empty-nesters care. Monitoring by videos, GPS and ultrasonic is the most common method to address the movement detection in IoTs. However, these efforts are circumscribed because they need the support of the special equipment, such as cameras, infrared equipment and ultrasonic facilities. It is significant to detect the movement in IoTs systems without additional equipment and ensure its high detection precision. Therefore, in this paper we derive an innovative method called Horizontal Slicing Clustering (HSC) to detect the movement in the IoTs. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data are the network parameters which are utilized in this method. The simulation results show their effectiveness in movement detection.",

abstract="In the big data protecting technologies, most of the existing data protections adopt entire encryption that leads to the researches of lightweight encryption algorithms, without considering from the protected data itself. In our previous paper (FGEM), it finds that not all the parts of a data need protections, the entire data protection can be supplanted as long as the critical parts of the structured data are protected. Reducing unnecessary encryption makes great sense for raising efficiency in big data processing. In this paper, the improvement of FGEM makes it suitable to protect semi-structured and unstructured data efficiently. By storing semi-structured and unstructured datum in an improved tree structure, the improved FGEM for the datum is achieved by getting congener nodes. The experiments show the improved FGEM has short operating time and low memory consumption.",

abstract="Edge analytics is an approach to data collection and analysis in which an automated analytical computation is performed on data at a sensor, network switch or other devices instead of waiting for the data to be sent back to a centralized data store. The data collection merits for normal edge operations but limits for the handling of anomaly events and prediction of prognostics conditions. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning edge approach that extends Kalman filter for anomaly detection so as to (a) allow the edge to adaptively collect granular data when abnormal or anomaly data markers witnessed for prognostics and (b) relaxes the data collection frequency for normal device operation cycles. In summary, the adaptive edge analytics fine-tunes the data collection and analysis so that overall health and longevity of the device can be improved. The paper presents prototyping dairy IoT sensor solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.",

In this work we present a conceptual framework to encourage the research community to develop more comprehensive and adaptive ICT solutions for prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions in the daily life of the aging population and beyond health facilities. We first present an overview of current international standards in human functioning and disability, and how chronic conditions are interconnected in older age. We then describe innovative mobile and sensor technologies, predictive data analysis in healthcare, and game-based prevention and rehabilitation techniques. We then set forth a multidisciplinary approach for the personalized prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions using unobtrusive and pervasive sensors, interactive activities, and predictive analytics, which also eases the tasks of health-related researchers, caregivers and providers. Our proposal represents a conceptual basis for future research, in which much remains to be done in terms of standardization of technologies and health terminology, as well as data protection and privacy legislation.",

abstract="Big Data has emerged as a significant area of study for both practitioners and researchers. Big Data is a term for massive data sets with large structure. In 2012, Big Data passed the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle, attesting the maturity level of this technology and its applications. The aim of this paper is to examine whether the Big Data research community reached the same level of maturity. For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on five dimensions, including the SMACIT perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a bibliometric study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications. The results have shown that even if significant contributions have been made by the research community, attested by a continuous increase in the number of scientific publications that address Big Data, it lags behind entreprises' expectations.",

abstract="Digital information within an enterprise consists of (1) structured data and (2) unstructured content. The structured data includes enterprise and business data like sales, customers, products, accounts, inventory and enterprise assets, etc. while the content includes contracts, reports, emails, customer opinions, transcribed calls, on-line inquires, complements and complaints. Further, cutting edge businesses also using GPS tracking or surveillance monitors as well as sensor technologies for productivity, performance and efficiency measures, and these are provided by outsourcers etc. Similarly in the Biomedical area, resources can be structured data say in Swiss- Prot or unstructured text information in journal articles stored in content repositories such as PubMed. The structured data and the unstructured content generally reside in entirely separate repositories with the former being managed by a DBMS and the latter by a content manager frequently provided by an outsourcer or vendor [76]. This separation is undesirable since the information content of these sources is complementary. Further, each outsourcer or vendor keep the data on their own Cloud, and data are not sharable between the vendor systems, and most vendor system were not integrated with the enterprise systems, and leaves the organization to consolidate the data and information manually for data analytics. Effective knowledge and information use requires seamless access and intelligent analysis of information in its totality to allow enterprises to gain enhanced critical insights. This is becoming even more important, as the proportion of structured to unstructured information has shifted from 50-50 in the 1960s to 5-95 today [1]. Unless we can effectively utilize the unstructured content conjointly with the structured data, we will only obtain very limited and shallow knowledge discovery from an increasingly narrow slice of information. The techniques developed in our research will then be used to address significant issues in three application areas, but potential applications with significant impact are much more extensive.",

These features of the framework provide Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) with ubiquitous access to sophisticated human computer interaction schemes for diverse uses. The proliferation of Smart TVs as central information hubs in elderly assisted living environments, along with the need for simple gesture control schemes for these demographics, provides one application of this framework.

abstract="Patients in intensive care often have a dozen or more medical devices and sensors attached to them. Each is a self-contained system that operates in ignorance of the others, and their integrated operation as a system of systems that delivers coherent therapy is performed by doctors and nurses. But we can easily imagine a scenario where the devices recognize each other and self-integrate (perhaps under the guidance of a master ``therapy app'') into a unified system. Similar scenarios can be (and are) envisaged for vehicles and roads, and for the devices and services in a home. These self-integrating systems have the potential for significant harm as well as benefit, so as they integrate they should adapt and configure themselves appropriately and should construct an ``assurance case'' for the utility and safety of the resulting system. Thus, trustworthy self-integration requires autonomous adaptation, synthesis, and verification at integration time, and this means that embedded automated deduction (i.e., theorem provers) will be the engine of integration.",

While this validation was conducted on smartphones running Google's Android operating system, our methodology is general and may be applied to different hardware platforms, reasoners, ontologies, and entire applications to determine performance relevant to power consumption.

In our e-health context we conceptualise this as the interplay between heavyweight and lightweight IT. Our research questions are, how does an innovation initiative develop within an established information infrastructure, and how can we overcome the barriers for interplay between heavyweight and lightweight technologies? Our empirical evidence is a case study in the health care sector in Norway, where we investigated a mega-program called Digital Renewal, and a small lightweight initiative called Medicloud. The theoretical lens was actor-network theory and we offer two insights. First, we identify a set of barriers for fruitful interplay between heavyweight and lightweight IT. Second, we show that these barriers may be overcome by a careful combination of technical and organisational solutions, in order to stabilise a new network as a part of the larger information infrastructure.",

Blockchains are the distributed ledger technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; the payments layer the Internet never had; a mechanism for updating truth states in distributed network computing through consensus trust; and overall, a new form of general computational substrate. Blocktime is the time over which a certain number of blocks will have confirmed; and this creates an alternative event trajectory in time which can be offset against human-time or other computing clocktime regimes for arbitrage or complementary purposes. The result of this effort is to show that blocktime allows the contingency of future events to be more robustly orchestrated through temporality as a selectable smart contract feature.",

The new services are supported by dynamic QR code identification and mHealth technologies. Preliminary results suggest that the digital ecosystems offer an opportunity to implement electronic labels (e-labels) in pharmacies, improve medicine information quality, and restore a broken link between medicine customer and medicine producer. Our findings can assist service design and service innovation in pharmaceutical supply chains. Moreover, they can support retail pharmacies in dealing with the increase of medicine compounding, address regulatory pressure for e-labeling, and to take advantage of their proximity to local communities.",

abstract="Multicarrier phase-based ranging is fast emerging as a cost-optimized solution for a wide variety of proximity-based applications due to its low power requirement, low hardware complexity and compatibility with existing standards such as ZigBee and 6LoWPAN. Given potentially critical nature of the applications in which phase-based ranging can be deployed (e.g., access control, asset tracking), it is important to evaluate its security guarantees. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the security of multicarrier phase-based ranging systems and specifically focus on distance decreasing relay attacks that have proven detrimental to the security of proximity-based access control systems (e.g., vehicular passive keyless entry and start systems). We show that phase-based ranging, as well as its implementations, are vulnerable to a variety of distance reduction attacks. We describe different attack realizations and verify their feasibility by simulations and experiments on a commercial ranging system. Specifically, we successfully reduced the estimated range to less than                                                                                   {\$}{\$}3{\backslash}, {\backslash}mathrm {\{}m{\}}{\$}{\$}                   even though the devices were more than 50 m apart.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment in which ``things'' (objects, animals or people) are provided with unique identifiers (IPv6 addresses) and the ability to communicate over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Radio-Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) is the key enabler of the IoT. The RFID Implant System considered in the proposed work consists of an implantable, passive RFID tag which is a data carrying device that is attached to the object to be identified, RFID reader which communicates with the tag in order to read or write data to its memory and, the back-end database which stores information related to the identified object. There are several security issues associated with the use of RFID tags in IoT like eavesdropping, impersonation, cloning, replay attack, tag destruction, unauthorized tag reading, tag modification etc. To defend such attacks effectively, efficient security mechanisms are essential. So, the proposed system aims to provide a secure mutual authentication mechanism based on Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) to authenticate the communication between the RFID tag and reader. The security of Hyper-elliptic Curve Cryptosystem depends on the hardness of solving hyper-elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (HCDLP). This problem helps to avoid the eavesdropper from breaking into the security of the HECC cryptosystem. The proposed work also uses D-Quark hash algorithm.",

abstract="Certificateless signature cryptography is an efficient approach studied widely because it eliminates the need of certificate authority in public key infrastructure. There are number of security algorithms based on PKC (Public Key Cryptography), ID based certificate less schemes using bilinear maps assumptions. But implementation costs of these schemes are very high. On the other hand RSA is a scheme widely applied in real-life scenarios. So in this paper we proposed a RSA based certificate less signature scheme especially for wireless sensor networks. We have shown that this scheme is secure in random oracles model. A random oracles model is a way to proof the security of cryptographic algorithms which use hash functions and exponential operations in algorithms. Security of this scheme is closely related to discrete logarithm problem. Our scheme provide security against type I attack, type II attack, it also ensures integrity, non-repudiation and authentication.",

We believe that textile interaction surfaces will be the next frontier of ubiquitous computing and identified many blank spots in the research landscape. Peoples' perception and acceptance of smooth and soft interaction surfaces is insufficiently understood. In this paper we present a study in which 90 people of a wide age range evaluated the suitability of smart textiles in different usage scenarios in the home environment. Overall, a solid willingness to use smart textiles as input devices was found, even though there were conditional acceptance criteria which should be given before participants would be willing to buy them. In contrast to many other technology contexts, however, age is not decisive in the evaluation of the usefulness of smart textiles. Younger and older adults seem to have a quite similar evaluation, hinting at a quite generic acceptance pattern.",

Smart Tourism Destinations should make an optimal use of Big Data by offering right services that suit users' preference at the right time. In relation thereto, this paper aims at contributing to the understanding on how Smart Tourism Destinations could potentially enhance tourism experience through offering products/services that are more personalised to meet each of visitor's unique needs and preferences. Understanding the needs, wishes and desires of travellers becomes increasingly critical for the competitiveness of destinations. Therefore, the findings in the present research are insightful for number of tourism destinations.",

abstract="As information technology and telecommunication systems continue to grow in size and complexity, especially with the Internet of Things (IoT) domain that is being hailed as the next industrial revolution, emerging technologies have to anticipate this dramatic increase of heterogeneous connected devices. This paper proposes a solution that can be used to manage this huge number of devices, by classifying them and predicting their device's type, based on their specifications. Four (4) classification algorithms are being applied on a dataset containing the specifications of known devices (in terms of known device type), which is being used for predicting the unknown devices' types. These algorithms are analyzed using the WEKA data mining tool and a comparative study is undertaken to find the classifier that performs the best analysis on the dataset obtained, using a set of predefined performance metrics to compare the results of each classifier.",

Nowadays, many new solutions are being released and put at the reach of most consumers for promoting their health and wellness self-management. However, most of these applications are of very limited use, arguable accuracy and scarce interoperability with other similar systems. Accordingly, frameworks that may orchestrate, and intelligently leverage, all the data, information and knowledge generated through these systems are particularly required. This work introduces Mining Minds, an innovative framework that builds on some of the most prominent modern digital technologies, such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet of Things, to enable the provision of personalized healthcare and wellness support.

abstract="Ten years ago, researchers in multi-agent systems became more and more aware that agent systems consist of more than only agents. The series of workshops on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS 2004-2006) emerged from this awareness. One of the primary outcomes of this endeavor was a principled understanding that the agent environment should be considered as a primary design abstraction, equally important as the agents. A special issue in JAAMAS 2007 contributed a set of influential papers that define the role of agent environments, describe their engineering, and outline challenges in the field that have been the drivers for numerous follow up research efforts. The goal of this paper is to wrap up what has been achieved in the past 10 years and identify challenges for future research on agent environments. Instead of taking a broad perspective, we focus on three particularly relevant topics of modern software intensive systems: large scale, openness, and humans in the loop. For each topic, we reflect on the challenges outlined 10 years ago, present an example application that highlights the current trends, and from that outline challenges for the future. We conclude with a roadmap on how the different challenges could be tackled.",

abstract="Big data play a central role in eHealth and have been crucial for designing and implementing clinical decisions support systems. Those applications can avail on data analysis and response capabilities, often empowered by Machine Learning algorithms, which can help clinician in diagnostic as well as therapeutic decisions. On the other hand, in the context of eSociety, eCommunities can be essential actors for managing and structuring medical data. In fact, they can support in gathering, providing and labeling data. This last task is highly relevant for medical Big Data, as it is a key point for supervised Machine Learning algorithms, which need an extensive data annotation process. This improves prediction and analysis capabilities of the algorithms on large datasets. Our approach on the medical Big Data labeling problem is the design and prototyping of a crowdsourcing collaborative Web Application, used for the annotation of medical images, that we named Medical Monkeys. Under the principles of mutual advantage and collaboration researchers, online gamers, medical students and patients will be involved, within this platform, in a virtual and mutually beneficial cooperation for improving Machine Learning algorithms. Using our application on large scale data analysis, algorithms for image segmentation will become useful for clinical decisions support systems. Our application is the result of a collaboration of several universities and research institutes and has, as principal aim, the integration, in form of gaming tasks, of eCommunities for the implementation of a more accurate analysis and diagnostic on MRI or CT images.",

We have already passed the verge of a paradigm shift where patients are regarded cooperative partners who play an important role in their own care. In the core of this ongoing shift is technology that enables a new kind of service provisioning and digitalization of services. This has created a dilemma; how the patients who are not able (or willing) to use these new services can be reached? To answer this question, a fresh outlook on the roles related to health service provisioning is needed. This examination calls for identification of health technology intermediaries, mediators, who stand at the crossroad of health, care and technology. This exploratory work will look into the intermediary roles, outlining a set of skills and capabilities needed from a mediator.",

Standard encryption techniques can offer confidentiality; however, they prevent search capabilities over the encrypted data, thereby significantly degrading the utilization of cloud storage services. Public key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) schemes offer encrypted search functionality to mitigate the impacts of privacy versus data utilization dilemma. PEKS schemes allow any client to encrypt their data under a public key such that the cloud, using the corresponding trapdoor, can later test whether the encrypted records contain certain keywords. Despite this great functionality, the existing PEKS schemes rely on extremely costly operations at the server-side, which often introduce unacceptable cryptographic delays in practical applications. Moreover, while data outsourcing applications usually demand long-term security, existing PEKS schemes do not offer post-quantum security.",

Cross-layer attack aims to achieve better attack effects, conceal attack behavior more better, reduce the cost of attack by using information from multiple protocol layers, or initiate attack at multiple layers cooperatively. There are now different understandings about cross-layer attack. In this paper, the definition of cross-layer attack is proposed and several cases of attacks are presented. In order to better understand their behaviors, the cases of cross-layer attack are modeled by utilizing unified modeling language, which helps to build more secure wireless sensor networks.",

abstract="With the rapid development of wireless sensor network, cloud computing and Internet of Things, the problems of security and privacy are becoming more and more serious. Elliptic curve cryptography as a public key cryptography plays an important role to solve the security issues, in which scalar multiplication is the most important and time-consuming operation. Koblitz curve is a special class of elliptic curve over binary field, Frobenius endomorphism can be used to accelerate the scalar multiplication. By converting single scalar multiplication into simultaneous multiple scalar multiplication, GLV method can use Straus-Shamir trick to calculate the scalar multiplication. In this paper, we combine the idea of Frobenius endomorphism and GLV method to speed up the scalar multiplication on Koblitz curve. Our algorithm can efficiently convert scalar multiplication into multi-scalar multiplication to reduce the cost of point additions and Frobenius operations. Theoretical analysis results show that: Compared with                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}                                                                  $\tau$                                                            -and-add algorithm, our 2-dimensional implementation provides a speedup over 19{\%}, 3-dimensional implementation speeds up over 29{\%}. Finally, a parallel scalar multiplication algorithm for Koblitz curve is designed, which can flexibly select the dimension of the parallel algorithm based on the number r of processing unit.

abstract="With the advent of the internet of things and industry 4.0 an enormous amount of data is produced at the edge of the network. Due to a lack of computing power, this data is currently send to the cloud where centralized machine learning models are trained to derive higher level knowledge. With the recent development of specialized machine learning hardware for mobile devices, a new era of distributed learning is about to begin that raises a new research question: How can we search in distributed machine learning models? Machine learning at the edge of the network has many benefits, such as low-latency inference and increased privacy. Such distributed machine learning models can also learn personalized for a human user, a specific context, or application scenario. As training data stays on the devices, control over possibly sensitive data is preserved as it is not shared with a third party. This new form of distributed learning leads to the partitioning of knowledge between many devices which makes access difficult. In this paper we tackle the problem of finding specific knowledge by forwarding a search request (query) to a device that can answer it best. To that end, we use a entropy based quality metric that takes the context of a query and the learning quality of a device into account. We show that our forwarding strategy can achieve over 95{\%} accuracy in a urban mobility scenario where we use data from 30 000 people commuting in the city of Trento, Italy.",

However, in the modern era, large scale experimentation as well as computer-based simulations are generating massive amounts of numeric data that are almost impossible to visualize using traditional plots and graphs as they are limited in both dimensions and scale. Video has gained increasing popularity for presenting data due to its ability to convey motion and time. While, such video presentations are undoubtedly useful, they provide limited contributions to cognitive development.

abstract="The main body of research clearly highlights the world's population is rapidly expanding. When this fact is combined with the increase in life longevity due to medical and social advances it alters the demographic balance in relation to age. Hence, the number of people aged 65 and over is constantly increasing. The potential of Smart Technologies and IoT-based devices to improve health has increased rapidly in the last few years and users are now in a position to contribute to the development of the interaction process and need to be properly trained on benefits of using new technologies. IFTTT (If This Then That), Blockly, and other similar tools provide a new perspective on web-based services, and represent an innovative and inclusive instrument to manage small automated tasks between Internet-connected devices by using a simplified interaction approach. The main research question of this work is: how could senior users benefit and adopt smart devices in a proficient way and how can emerging technologies such as automation services enhance safety, health and well-being for people with different abilities? The research method is based on a participatory, Inclusive Design approach, developed through interviews and focus groups, among a restricted number of people of different age and gender, design and usability tests in the further stage. The aim of the work is to make existing technologies more accepted, usable and inclusive for as many people as possible. This goal will be achieved by analysis and by creating a set of interactive and easy to use information and tools for automating different processes, to improve the performance in Activities of Daily Living and increase the connection and socialization between citizens, their family and friends. Applets for Seniors could be seen as a different approach to enable users with different abilities in interacting in a friendly way with new technologies and could be also used as a User Experience facilitator for people who are not familiar with smart devices.",

abstract="The Internet is rapidly evolving from a network of personal computers and servers to a network of smart objects (``things'') able to communicate with each other and with central resources. This evolution has created a demand for lightweight implementations of cryptographic algorithms suitable for resource-constrained devices such as RFID tags and wireless sensor nodes. In this paper we describe a highly optimized software implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for the MSP430 series of ultra-low-power 16-bit microcontrollers. Our software is scalable in the sense that it supports prime fields and elliptic curves of different order without recompilation, which allows for flexible trade-offs between execution time (i.e. energy consumption) and security. The low-level modular arithmetic is optimized for pseudo-Mersenne primes of the form                                                                                   {\$}{\$}p = 2^n - c{\$}{\$}                   where n is a multiple of 16 minus 1 and c fits in a 16-bit register. All prime-field arithmetic functions are parameterized with respect to the length of operands (i.e. the number of 16-bit words they consist of) and written in Assembly language, whereby we avoided conditional jumps and branches that could leak information about the secret key. Our ECC implementation can perform scalar multiplication on two types of elliptic curves, namely Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves. A full scalar multiplication using a Montgomery curve over a 159-bit field requires about                                                                                   {\$}{\$}3.86 {\backslash}cdot 10^6{\$}{\$}                   clock cycles when executed on an MSP430F1611 microcontroller.",

abstract="MEMS research has until recently focused mainly on the engineering process, resulting in interesting products and a growing market. To fully realize the promise of MEMS, the next step is to add embedded intelligence. With embedded intelligence, the scalability of manufacturing will enable distributed MEMS systems consisting of thousands or millions of units which can work together to achieve a common goal. However, before such systems can become a reallity, we must come to grips with the challenge of scalability which will require paradigm-shifts both in hardware and software. Furthermore, the need for coordinated actuation, programming, communication and mobility management raises new challenges in both control and programming. The objective of this article is to report the progresses made by taking the example of two research projects and by giving the remaining challenges and the perspectives of distributed intelligent MEMS.",

abstract="Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have received significant attention nowadays due to the excess number of applications and services. D2D communication promises a higher data rate, lower communication delays, and better power efficiency. Therefore, D2D is expected to be a vital technical component in Internet of Things (IoT) and play an important role with the next generation 5G. Moreover, the rapid growth in mobile capabilities opens the door to the cyber criminals that explore new avenues for malware attacks. Although the literature is proposed security schemes for malware attacks. However, the research field is still immature and unexplored in depth due to the fast evolution of malware at a rate far exceeding the evolution of security techniques. In this paper, the problem of detecting malware attacks is considered in D2D network and a secure energy-efficient routing protocol is proposed. The protocol aims at detecting malware attached to message before it infects the targeted device through optimal secure energy-efficient routes. Moreover, the protocol takes into account the attacker's behavior, computation of players' strategies including different attack cases and consideration of the dynamic scheme in terms of calculating malware detection capabilities and malware types due to the fast evolution of the malware. Through simulations, the proposed routing protocol is evaluated in terms of the detecting rate of the malicious messages and overall expected payoff of the defender compared with other non-strategic routing protocols. Results show that the game achieves Nash equilibrium, and leads to an optimal defense strategy for the network.",

RFID reader redundant deployment optimization can ensure that users use the minimum number of readers to cover a specific range of all tags.

abstract="Safety is of growing importance for information systems due to increased integration with embedded systems. Discovering potential hazards as early as possible in the development is key to avoid costly redesign later. This implies that hazards should be identified based on the requirements, and it is then useful to compare various specification techniques to find out the strengths and weaknesses of each with respect to finding and documenting hazards. This paper reports on two experiments in hazards identification -- one experiment based on textual use cases and one based on systems sequence diagrams. The comparison of the experimental results reveal that use cases are better for identifying hazards related to the operation of the system while system sequence diagrams are better for the identification of hazards related to the system itself. The combination of these two techniques is therefore likely to uncover more hazards than one technique alone.",

abstract="Computers that negotiate on our behalf hold great promise for the future and will even become indispensable in emerging application domains such as the smart grid, autonomous driving, and the Internet of Things. Much research has thus been expended to create agents that are able to negotiate in an abundance of circumstances. However, up until now, truly autonomous negotiators have rarely been deployed in real-world applications. This paper sizes up current negotiating agents and explores a number of technological, societal and ethical challenges that autonomous negotiation systems are bringing about. The questions we address are: in what sense are these systems autonomous, what has been holding back their further proliferation, and is their spread something we should encourage? We relate the automated negotiation research agenda to dimensions of autonomy and distill three major themes that we believe will propel autonomous negotiation forward: accurate representation, long-term perspective, and user trust. We argue these orthogonal research directions need to be aligned and advanced in unison to sustain tangible progress in the field.",

abstract="The widespread introduction of lightweight IT---smartphones, tablets, the Internet of Things, and the growth of third-party app developers---has become a challenge for many organizations. Local units and end-users increasingly are acquiring and implementing lightweight IT outside the realm of the IT function. The trend is driven by competent users' need for innovative IT services, enabled by the consumerization of digital technologies. Lightweight IT entails exciting business opportunities; however, guidance for managers on how to deal with this development has been very limited. In this paper, we investigate which IT governance models organizations can apply to manage lightweight IT. The managerial challenge is to balance the innovative potential of lightweight IT with the requirements of good governance. Building on the particular challenges of lightweight IT and the extant literature on end-user computing, we present a framework with four alternative governance models. We evaluate the framework through four e-health case studies.",

abstract="With the popularity of Internet of Things (IOT) applications, various kinds of active sensors are deployed and multivariate time series datasets are generated rapidly. Early classification of multivariate time series is an emerging topic in data mining due to the wide applications in many domains. The unique part of early classification lies in that it uses only earlier part of time series data to reach classification results with the same accuracy as by methods using complete time series information. Although a number of relevant studies have been presented recently, most of them didn't consider the issues of data scale and execution efficiency simultaneously. The main research issue of this paper falls in how to mine interpretable patterns from multivariate time series data, with which effective classification models can be constructed to ensure the accuracy as well as earliness. To take into account the issues of data scale and execution efficiency simultaneously, we explore distributed in-memory computing techniques and multivariate shapelets-based approaches to construct a Spark-based in-memory mining framework to parallelize the feature extraction process. We implement a framework with Multivariate Shapelets Detection (MSD) method as a based example. Through empirical evaluation on various kinds of sensory datasets, the scalability of the framework is evaluated in terms of efficiency while ensuring the same accuracy and reliability in early classification of multivariate time series. This work is the first one to realize multivariate time series early classification on Spark distributed in-memory computing platform, which can serve as a good base for an extension to other time series classification methods based on shapelet feature extraction.",

Composed of a growing Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data analysis, mobile Internet via broadband connections, or objects and sensors via low-cost data links, the greatest challenge today is to meaningfully manage such systems in the widespread virus and attacks. Given that these systems will greatly impact the operation of smart city, issues related to privacy and security has come into limelight.

abstract="Our paper presents a proposition for the new approach to the role of library in a sustainable city. An in-depth literary review on smart library concept is presented along the comparative insight into contemporary smart city and sustainable city literature. Based on these findings a proposition is depicted for smart and sustainable library as a central public institution of a sustainable smart city. Several library services of the new generation based on cutting edge technologies and user participation are proposed. The claim is made that sustainable library is to be an integral part of a sustainable city making not just an-other useful urban addition providing for some of the various smart and sustain-able services of the new city, but a central hub that carter for constant upgrade of information literacy of its users allowing for innovativeness and creativity of citizens of sustainable cities to come to the fore.",

The agent technology needs to embrace these trends in order to remain relevant in the new era. In this paper, we present recent developments of our web-based multiagent middleware named Siebog. Siebog employs enterprise technologies on the server side in order to provide automatic agent load-balancing and fault-tolerance. On the client, it relies on HTML5 and related standards in order to run on a wide variety of hardware and software platforms. Now, with automatic clustering and state persistence, Siebog can support thousands of external devices hosting tens of thousands of client-side agents.",

abstract="With the integration of WSNs and cloud computing, sensor-cloud system becomes popular in many fields where the physical nodes can be shared with multiple users. However, when a physical sensor node receives multiple service commands simultaneously, there are some service collisions, namely, coupling problem. This coupling problem leads to the failure of services. It is necessary to solve this problem, thus the reliability of system can be improved. In this paper, we propose a fog-based model and extend the classical Hungarian algorithm. The fog layer acts as a buffer and controller between the wireless sensor networks layer and the cloud layer in this model, where we use the classical Hungarian algorithm in the first matching and then schedule idle resources to achieve optimal matching. Experimental results and theoretical analysis show that our method can efficiently solve the coupling problem and increase the resource utilization and resource reliability.",

abstract="Business Process Management has substantially matured over the last two decades. The techniques, methods and systems available to scope, model, analyze, implement, execute, monitor and even mine a process have been scientifically researched and can be in most cases deployed in practice. In fact, many of these BPM capabilities are nowadays a commodity. However, an opportunity-rich environment and rapidly emerging digital disruptions require new BPM capabilities. In light of this context, this paper proposes three future research and development directions for BPM academics and professionals. First, Ambidextrous BPM demands the shift of focus from exploitative to explorative BPM. Second, Value-driven BPM postulates a stronger focus on the desired outcomes as opposed to the available BPM methods. Third, Customer Process Management suggests complementing the dominating internal view of BPM with a stronger, design-inspired view on the process experiences of external stakeholders.",

abstract="As a result of the remarkable advances in sensing and digital communication technologies, massive amounts of data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we propose a framework for data provisioning that relies on the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud delivery model. IoT Data is processed and aggregated at the edge of where it is generated, then, it is stored in the cloud. Since smart connected devices are proliferating at an unprecedented pace, we anticipate that the number of DaaS providers will also grow at the same rate. Therefore, data consumers will seek to find suitable DaaS providers that can provide them with high-quality data. DaaS Brokers will emerge to mediate between data providers and data consumers and help data consumers find appropriate DaaS providers using different ranking algorithms. We propose an algorithm to evaluate the offers of potential DaaS providers based on the quality-of-data (QoD) requirements of the data consumer and using fitness functions associated with each QoD dimension.",

abstract="A wireless sensor network is one popular candidate for the fundamental backbone of IoT (Internet of Things). Among the key technologies involved in wireless sensor networks, fault detection techniques are indispensable for maintaining the availability of sensor applications. To employ a distributed fault detection scheme, we address a generalized data inconsistency detection model and apply it to recognize data inconsistencies within a wireless sensor network. Then, we formally prove that data inconsistencies can be correctly recognized under the requisite conditions, and we evaluate the robustness of the generalized data inconsistency detection under the probability fault model. Our numerical result indicates that the degree of robustness eventually approaches to 1 if the node reliability is greater than 0.5. Moreover, we show that the tolerable defect rate of the generalized data inconsistency detection is strictly less than                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            1                      2                                                                    , so its defect-free rate must be greater than                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            1                      2                                                                    .

abstract="Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of ``D2B'' time, which is defined as the time interval between an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patient arrives at hospital and he/she receives primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient's Electrocardiogram (ECG) must be confirmed by a cardiologist and made sure the patient really has AMI. For the confirmation, the cardiologists must access a PC, connect it to the intranet of the hospital and employ the special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can diagnose the ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since PC, the browser and/or network may be currently unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a system with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG after receiving the short message service (SMS) text issued by his/her hospital so as to avoid the mentioned problem and shorten the D2B time.",

abstract="Advances in wireless communication technologies and the internet of things are leading to new developments in the domain of wearable, smart medical devices (SMDs) as a major disruptive trend for the medical industry. Wearable smart sensor technology with non-invasive or invasive implantable materials has a great potential for interfacing with the human body, thanks to low-power silicon-based electronics that are very efficient in data processing and transmission. Novel SMDs are designed for monitoring living being's vital signs, such as blood pressure, cardiac monitoring, respiration rate, body temperature, etc. in either medical diagnostic or health monitoring. Considering various smart devices in the medical industry, a key decision is which device to choose and apply on the patient. The decision on the evaluation of SMDs is a complicated problem that needs to be assessed from different perspectives. This study guides decision makers on the selection of SMDs of wearable vital sign sensors under different evaluation criteria. A multi criteria decision making approach is proposed to support the SMD selection process under group decision making (GDM) in an uncertain environment. A significant feature of this analysis is the complexity of the selected decision criteria for the SMD evaluation. To simulate these processes, a methodology that combines interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) with Vi{\v{s}}ekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje (VIKOR) under GDM is proposed. This methodology is then used to measure the assessment of four SMDs using five evaluation criteria. To validate the proposed approach, the selection methodology for wearable vital sign monitoring devices is applied on a case study.",

abstract="Context-awareness is one of the most relevant research areas in Pervasive Computing scope. However, in more complex environments, loosely coupled data and dynamic behavior of the environment can become a source of serious problems. These problems can spread throughout whole proactive behavior and in this way make them difficult to handle. In this paper we argue that there is a lack of research done about the data quality and quality of awareness particularly in this kind of composite systems. We investigate on how to build the semantic layer of the DOHA middleware due to reach the goal of context-awareness. To achieve that we are using a data quality approach and data profiles. In addition, we use ontologies as information representation method and to carry over the information about the profiles to the pervasive environment. By doing so, we assure proper representation of the real world and we are improving semantic data and context-awareness in such environments.",

abstract="Several initiatives propose the use of opportunistic networks and heterogeneous devices to help overcome the communication and coordination limitations evidenced during first response activities in disaster relief scenarios. These solutions tend to create an Internet of Things ecosystem in which most components are mobile, autonomous and interact with other in a loosely-coupled fashion. Regardless the benefits provided by these infrastructures, the message delivery on them does not consider time constraints. This aspect is particularly relevant in this scenario since the time to conduct the first response activities is quite short, therefore they must be done quickly and coordinately. Trying to help address this challenge, this paper proposes a message propagation model for opportunistic networks that considers heterogeneous devices and guarantees the real-time behavior of the network by bounding the maximum delay for messages transmission. The message propagation is modeled using an analytical approach. Two different scheduling policies are used to analyze the model and their feasibility conditions are proved.",

abstract="The core of innovation design for product service system is to provide products and services meeting the needs of users. Traditional user research methods have many drawbacks, such as data interference, fuzzy feedback, single-dimensional indicators lack mutual verification, these issues have not been effectively resolved. If the designer can't understand the users' needs in time and objectively, and accurately construct the users' mental model, it will make the design decision blurred and slow, and the design scheme lacks the utility. Taking into account the drawbacks of traditional user research methods, we use the multidimensional data collaborative analysis technology to obtain user, environment, tasks and other context information. The interaction between the user and the product service system is selected, and the context data of the target user is acquired by using the wearable device, the eye movement measurement and behavior analysis system. These methods can assist the designer discover the product service system usability problem, understand the users' needs, build the users' mental model. This paper focuses on the research of user mental model acquisition mechanism in Product Service System Innovation Process. Based on context awareness multidimensional data collaborative analysis, the users' mental model is constructed accurately. To promote the effective matching between the design conceptual model and the user mental model to produce the optimal design, avoid the waste of the design process resources.",

abstract="Smart care technology which has made strides is recognized vital in the aging society. This study was intended to examine trends and outlook of smart care by type of elderly and situation to spur improvement in health management for the elderly. Smart cares by type of elderly and situation were elderly-friendly smart home, smart care for management of chronic diseases in the elderly, and smart care for the elderly living alone. Smart care is needed to be implemented actively not only to reduce medical costs and improve the quality of medical services but also to ensure safety and quality of life for the elderly. However, multi-faceted efforts need to be made to help overcome the difficulties arising from degraded cognitive function of the elderly, considering the basic orientation of smart care such as mobile, smart, cloud computing, IoT, etc. For that, it would be necessary to develop elderly-friendly devices suited for characteristics of the elderly group and to actively deploy professional manpower, in parallel with active support from related organizations, who can provide instant support to the elderly encountering difficulty with the use, so as to stimulate the smart care service in the period ahead. Furthermore, as health information and privacy information generated in connection with individuals are sensitive data, it would be the most important to ensure that strict security is maintained for safe data transmission and that only necessary part of information is shared selectively.",

The approach is based on the integration of a semantic framework, where a reasoner can take decisions about the configuration of robot services and resources. An ontology has been designed to model the robot and the relevant context information. Besides rules are used to encode human knowledge and serve as policies for the reasoner. The approach has been successfully implemented in a mobile robot, which showed to be more capable of solving not pre-designed situations.",

abstract="Industry 4.0 initiatives have fostered the definition of different standards, e.g., AutomationML or OPC UA, allowing for the specification of industrial objects and for machine-to-machine communication in Smart Factories. Albeit facilitating interoperability at different steps of the production life-cycle, the information models generated from these standards are not semantically defined, making the semantic data integration a challenging problem. We tackle the problems of integrating data from documents specified either using the same or different Industry 4.0 standards, and propose a rule-based framework that combines deductive databases and Semantic Web technologies to effectively solve these problems. As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a Datalog-based representation for AutomationML documents, and a set of rules for identifying semantic heterogeneity problems among these documents. We have empirically evaluated our proposed framework against several benchmarks and the initial results suggest that exploiting deductive and Semantic Web techniques allows for increasing scalability, efficiency, and coherence of models for Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments.",

Therefore, 5G will rely heavily on its intelligent capability. The intelligent model proposed in this paper is constructed from 3 main intelligent aspects, i.e. network, spectrum and applications. We further elaborate the regulatory actions in which the regulator should develop relevant policies in response to some consequences. First, intelligent network will impact cost structure and tighten the market competition. Second, intelligent spectrum will result in the need of spectrum refarming, pooling as well as the open spectrum access. Third, the presence of intelligent applications will emphasize privacy and security aspects as critical points of 5G implementation.",

However, the impact has been less than positive and it has been argued that interventional informatics using data-driven interventions is required to achieve evidence-based clinical decision-support. In this paper we discuss context-Aware, evidence-based, data driven development of diagnostic scales created using multi-disciplinary collaborative development. The goal is the development of novel dynamic scales for decision-support in healthcare provision and, while clinicians may derive benefit from such systems, there are potentially greater benefits for all stakeholders in medical triage systems using both face-to-face and remote consultations. While our focus lies in depression, the proposed approach will generalise to a diverse range of domains, systems, and technologies.",

In two evaluated criteria from three the Czech Republic was comparable to Poland. The age groups show that with increasing age there is a declining trend for the use of social networks. 10.1{\%} of the population from 55 to 64 years and 3.3{\%} of the population over 65 use social networks in the second quarter of 2015. Data show that almost half of the elderly people that use social networks get connected almost every day.",

abstract="For supporting rescue operations in disasters, vital data collections in wireless sensor networks have been proposed so far. In such systems, we can expect to predict each patient's probability of survival based on real-time vital data. In this paper, we focus on prehospital care and propose a method to determine treatment plans and schedules of patients. The proposed method maximizes the number of expected saved patients under limited medical resources. This optimization problem is called Treatment Planning and Scheduling, which is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on depth-limited search. We have compared the proposed method with greedy methods. The results show the proposed method can derive solutions in practical time and the average number of saved patients is 10{\%} larger compared to the greedy methods.",

abstract="In ``China Cardiovascular Disease Report 2015'', research shows that mortality of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) was rapidly increased since 2005. The mortality in 2014 was 123.92/lakh, which was 4.4 times higher than in 2002. Cardiovascular disease is ranked No. 1 in cause of death in China right now, in both rural and urban areas. This paper presents a medical information sharing platform based on mobile Internet, cloud computing and big data mining. It is designed to support the PB-level data management and analysis, and millions of concurrent instant messaging. The platform has the following functions: intelligent transportation decision support based on FMC-D time, built-in medical communication unit, built-in medical information sharing unit and quality control system of PCI hospital interventional images. The platform is divided into two parts - medical unit terminals (including EMS terminal, non-PCI hospital terminal and PCI hospital terminal) and cloud computing server, in which data is exchanged via 3G/4G wireless networks. The system has the following characteristics: (1) Timeline, which is a collection of key nodes that describe the AMI patient care process, (2) Smart recommendation technology, for example recommending hospitals based on the distance, medical care ability, idle resource. (3) Capacity to support, such as large number of concurrent collaborative treatment process among multiple PCI hospitals, multi-non-PCI medical institutions, and multi-EMS institutions, as well as the PB level data which are generated in the process.",

abstract="Public-key cryptography based on the ``ring-variant'' of the Learning with Errors (ring-LWE) problem is both efficient and believed to remain secure in a post-quantum world. In this paper, we introduce a carefully-optimized implementation of a ring-LWE encryption scheme for 8-bit AVR processors like the ATxmega128. Our research contributions include several optimizations for the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) used for polynomial multiplication. More concretely, we describe the Move-and-Add (MA) and the Shift-Add-Multiply-Subtract-Subtract (SAMS2) technique to speed up the performance-critical multiplication and modular reduction of coefficients, respectively. We take advantage of incompletely-reduced intermediate results to minimize the total number of reduction operations and use a special coefficient-storage method to decrease the RAM footprint of NTT multiplications. In addition, we propose a byte-wise scanning strategy to improve the performance of a discrete Gaussian sampler based on the Knuth-Yao random walk algorithm. For medium-term security, our ring-LWE implementation needs 590 k, 672 k, and 276 k clock cycles for key-generation, encryption, and decryption, respectively. On the other hand, for long-term security, the execution time of key-generation, encryption, and decryption amount to 2.2 M, 2.6 M, and 686 k cycles, respectively. These results set new speed records for ring-LWE encryption on an 8-bit processor and outperform related RSA and ECC implementations by an order of magnitude.",

With the advancement in the healthcare systems especially through the Internet of Things give rises to patient privacy. We developed a healthcare system that protects identity of patients using innovative zero-watermarking algorithm along with vocal fold disorders detection. To avoid audio signal distortion, proposed system embeds watermark in a secret key of identity by visual cryptography rather than audio signal. The secret shares generated through visual cryptography are inserted in the secret watermark key by computing the features of audio signals. The proposed technique is evaluated using audio samples taken from voice disorder database of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). Experimental results prove that the proposed technique achieves imperceptibility with reliability to extract identity, unaffected disorder detection result with high robustness. The results are provided in form of Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCR), Bit Error Rate (BER), and Energy Ratio (ENR).",

abstract="Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are used to monitor and treat physiological conditions within the body. They communicate telemetry data to external reader/programmer device and receive control commands using wireless medium. Wireless communication for IMDs increases cost effectiveness, flexibility, ease of use and also enables remote configuration and monitoring. However, it makes the IMDs vulnerable to passive and active attacks. While passive attacks on IMDs can be addressed using encryption techniques, active attacks like replay, massage injection and MITM need more advanced techniques to be detected and prevented. In case of other wireless devices one can deal with these security issues by installing one or more security mechanisms, but the same cannot be applied to IMDs. This is due to their positioning inside human body which makes replacement and power charging extremely difficult, their miniaturization which makes them storage, processing and power scarce, their unusual access requirements during device or patient emergency and their incapability of renewing shared secrets. It is advisable to use the resources of IMDs for life critical medical care and minimalist communication. This leads to the implied option of using an external proxy device which can offload security related processing from IMDs. Therefore, to address the problem of active attacks, we propose use of RF-signal based localization technique which leverages multi-antenna Proxy Device to profile the directions at which reader/programmer signal arrives and use of triangulation techniques to construct a signature that uniquely distinguishes an authorized reader/programmer from unauthorized one.",

In this paper, we apply leading privacy models to the results of qualitative research in which we solicited ideas for adding intelligence to homes and buildings, paying particular attention to information sensitivity about everyday activities that take place in those settings. We identify locations and activities that are particularly information-sharing sensitive, prioritize the salience of different types of privacy violations for householders and workers, and examine the influence of privacy attitudes on smart device ownership and desired future smart experiences.",

abstract="Floating Content (FC) is an infrastructure-less communication paradigm based on opportunistic replication of a piece of content in a geographically constrained location and for a limited amount of time. The fact that it does not rely on any infrastructure makes it appealing for all those settings where infrastructure is not available or malfunctioning. In this paper we analyze its feasibility in the aftermath of a disaster, as a communication service in support of applications for rescue coordination and situational awareness. We analyze the possible scenarios of disaster, with a special focus on the local context (Iceland in our case), and on a subset of disasters which are of economic and social interests. We characterize the available communication network, its structure, and we individuate some criticalities which could play a key role in case of disaster. Specifically, we consider two services, related to two disaster scenarios. A first one is a form of situation awareness, without the support of fixed communication infrastructure. A second service is a form of infrastructure-less social driving application. The exchange of information between vehicles in the vicinity of a region interested by a disaster, enabled by such app, could help mitigate the impact of disasters and hazardous conditions on vehicle traffic. For both services, we describe a possible implementation using Floating Content. Finally, for these scenarios, we identify some research issues which stand in the way of a realistic, practical implementation based on FC.",

Though ubiquity of mobile devices and availability of e-Health record plays an important role to enhance health care quality and services, it introduces several challenges too such as, limited power of mobile devices, privacy and anonymity of patient data, the reliability of end user, interoperability and availability of e-Health records, etc. Under HIPAA regulations, healthcare data needs to be secured from unsolicited disclosure when sharing among multiple medical service providers. In this paper, we focus on exchanging healthcare data among doctor and patient's healthcare service providers. We develop an android mobile application and a Cloud service to exchange patient's data among authorized users in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The cloud service that we developed performs cryptographic computations, communicates with mobile application and also overcomes the limitations of mobile devices. We evaluate our proposed solution using real-world data set. The performance analysis proves the efficiency of our application.

The first two offering data management, the last two adding flexible and scalable processing capacities. We also turn our attention to realtime data processing, lambda architecture and its relation with scalability, and we revisit our own recent research on the issue. Three approaches are included that are directly related to realtime and scalability: the use of a realtime component in a data warehouse, parallelized de-normalization for scalability and execution tree sharing for scaling to simultaneous sessions. With these models and technologies we revisit some of the major current solutions for data management and data processing with scalability and realtime capacities.",

abstract="To enhance the performance and efficiency of business processes, it is essential to take the dynamics of their execution context into account during process modelling. This paper first proposes an evaluation framework that identifies the main requirements for supporting the modelling of context-adaptive processes. Using this framework, we analyse four popular business process modelling languages: Coloured Petri Nets (CPN), Business Process Modelling and Notation 2.0 (BPMN), Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL), and Unified Modelling Language Activity Diagrams (UML AD). The analysis is carried out by evaluating how the respective language notations fulfil the identified requirements in several real-life scenarios. Lastly, a comparative analysis of the languages focussed on their support for modelling context-adaptive business processes is provided.",

abstract="Communication technologies have revolutionized modern society. They have changed the way we do business, travel, manage our personal lives and communicate with our friends. In many cases, this crucially depends on accurate and reliable authentication. We need to get authenticated in order to get access to restricted services and/or places (i.e. transport systems, e-banking, border control). This authentication is performed in constrained settings due to: (i) privacy issues, (ii) noisy conditions, (iii) resource constraints. Privacy-preservation is essential for the protection of sensitive information (i.e. diseases, location, nationality). Noisy conditions refer to physical noise in the communication channel that may lead to modification of the transmitted information, or natural variability due to the authentication medium (e.g. fingerprint scans). Resource constraints refer to limited device power/abilities (i.e. sensors, RFID tags). It is a very challenging problem to develop privacy-preserving authentication for noisy and constrained environments that optimally balance authentication accuracy, privacy-preservation and resource consumption. In this paper, we describe the main challenges of the problem of authentication in constrained settings, the current state-of-the-art of the field and possible directions of research.",

abstract="As populations age and chronic diseases become more prevalent, new strategies are required to help people live well. Traditional models of episodic health care will not be sufficient to meet changing health care needs and the reorientation of services towards maintaining function as opposed to treating illness. One strategy to meet these challenges is an increased focus on self-care via use of broader social networks and seamless integration of applications with lifestyle activities, particularly for people with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. There has also been a rapid increase in a range of technologies for connecting different components of the health system and delivering services through smartphones and connected devices. Our proposal is to pursue systems development in healthcare in a way that considers a range of aspects known as SHARP: Sustainable, Holistic, Adaptive, Real-time and Precise.

abstract="In recent years, Data Mining techniques such as classification, clustering, association, regression etc. are widely used in healthcare field to help analyzing and predicting disease and improving the quality and efficiency of medical services. This paper presents a web-based platform for big data analysis of healthcare using Data Mining techniques. The platform consists of three main layers: Apache Spark Layer, Workflow Layer and Web Service Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Apache Spark functionalities as regular Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) operations. Meanwhile, this layer provides a cache mechanism to maximize the use of the results as much as possible which were calculated before. Workflow Layer encapsulates a variety of nodes for Data Mining, which have different roles such as data source, algorithm model or evaluation tool. These nodes can be organized into a workflow which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then it will be submitted to Apache Spark Layer to execute. And we have implemented many models including Na{\"i}ve Bayes model, Decision Tree model and Logistic Regression model etc. for healthcare big data. Web Service Layer implements rich restful API including data uploading, workflow composition and analysis task submission. We also provide a web graphical interface for the user. Through the interface users can achieve efficient Data Mining without any programming which can greatly help the medical staff who don't understand programming to diagnose the patients' condition more accurately and efficiently.",

abstract="Wearable devices, e.g. smart-watches, are gaining popularity in many fields and in wellness monitoring too. In this paper we propose an IoT application to alert the medical doctor assigned to a critical unit by using a smart-watch. The wearable device improves the efficacy of monitoring patients at risk in hospital units allowing the medical doctor to access information at any time and from any place. A network was built to wirelessly connect bio-sensing platforms, which measure metabolites concentration in patients' fluids (e.g. blood), with a dedicated application running on the smart-watch. In case of anomalous measured values, incoming alert notifications are received to ask urgent medical intervention. The main advantage of this new approach is that the doctors, or in general the caregivers, can freely move in the hospital other structures and perform other tasks meanwhile simultaneously and constantly monitoring all the patients thanks to the technology on their wrist.",

Existing ways of PHR- and EHR-collection include harvesting medical and individual data from different data sources that store different medical, not standardized data. Such a heterogeneity increases the complexity of merging PHR and EHR. We focus on the integration process as a main aspect for solving the heterogeneity issue. Thereby, we aim at reducing the merging complexity by defining the requirements for PHR data collection and creating an ontology for a semantically sound data-set merger for personal-centric healthcare systems and we evaluate the results with formal means.",

abstract="As Taiwan enters an aging society, osteoarthritisOsteoarthritis (OA) has become a common chronic disease among the elderly population. Knee is the most predilection site of OA. In the later stages of OA, knee replacementKnee replacement surgery is considered the best treatment of OA. A complete course of treatment, however, does not end once the operation is over; instead, it includes the follow-up rehabilitation exercise, tracks and observation. Rehabilitation exercise requires patient cooperation to continue with the rehabilitation at home. Due to various factors, however, many patients are unable to carry out the rehabilitation adequately to ensure satisfactory results. Hence, it is important to have a home-based rehabilitation system that could enable the communication between the patients and their doctors, and record the information about their rehabilitation. The system developed in this study uses a 3-Axis G SensorG sensor to measure the knee angles during the rehabilitation, and uses Bluetooth to transmit the rehabilitation data to the computer. The data are then stored in a cloud database and are presented visually in the back-end. The physiatrists in the hospital have real-time access to and monitor every patient in their course of rehabilitation, thus giving them prompt feedbacks. The proposed remote rehabilitation platform makes it possible for patients and doctors to improve the quality of home rehabilitation after knee replacement surgery.",

The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of `ambient assisted living' as an instantiation of the concept of `intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the idea of `ambient assisted living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.",

abstract="Patient's motion recognition is quite popular in the area of healthcare and medical service nowadays. By analyzing the data from variant sensors within the network, we can estimate the activities a person does. The analyzing job is usually done by a classifier which can classify each motion into one category with similar movements. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a kind of algorithm that can be used to arrange data into different categories without any guidance. Decision tree is a mature tool for classification. In this paper, we propose a new kind of classification method with data from BAN called SOM-Decision Tree. Firstly, we use SOM on each of the sensor nodes to categorize motions into different classes, so that motions in different classes can be distinguished by this sensor. Secondly, a decision tree is constructed to discriminate each kind of movements from other motions. Finally, any action of the same patient can be recognized by query through the decision tree. According to our experiment, this algorithm is feasible and quite efficient.",

In this ageing period maintaining independents and good health for as long as possible is essential. Using telemonitoring technologies in home environment is still under development, but this method appears to be one of the most promising approaches to facilitate independent living for elderly. With the current technology, it is possible to implement solutions that until recently seemed to be a distant vision of the future and it provides new opportunities for diagnosis, prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation, and also improve the quality of life.

abstract="With the increasing number of Web services, the personalized recommendation of Web services has become more and more important. Fortunately, the social network popularity nowadays brings a good alternative for social recommendation to avoid the data sparsity problem that is not treated very well in the collaborative filtering approach. Since the social network provides a big data about the users, the trust concept has become necessary to filter this abundance and to foster the successful interactions between the users. In this paper, we firstly propose a trusted friend detection mechanism in a social network. The dynamic of the users' interactions over time and the similarity of their interests have been considered. Secondly, we propose a Web service social recommendation mechanism which considers the expertise of the trusted friends according to their past invocation histories and the active user's query. The experiments of each mechanism produced satisfactory results.",

Also the existence of multiple sensor devices in Hospital Units like ICUs (Intensive Care Units) constitute a big source of data, increasing the volume of health information to be analyzed in order to detect or predict abnormal situations in patients. In order to process this huge volume of information it is necessary to use Big Data and IoT technologies.

New, innovative solutions are provided, like remote health monitoring, which provide cost effective services in a relative low cost infrastructure. This paper presents PISCES, a responsive health monitoring mobile information system, which enables remote monitoring of the patients' health-status and physical performances. The goal of the PISCES solution is not only to monitor the health status of the participants, but react in any case of deficiency, as well as giving the opportunity to increase the level of the physical activities.

Though the challenges to adoption of information security controls in health informatics are usually reflected on the technologies' usability aspect, they are deeply rooted on the socio-technical level involving various human factors such as the gap in the working culture, in the professional language and its implications, and in the understanding of the workflow and the operational mechanisms in the two fields - healthcare and security.

We find that the groups of papers cover all areas of the framework well for a variety of work and leisure domains. The area in strongest need for more research papers is the development of the holistic framework itself. Furthermore, much focus has been on studying design sketching or implemented systems-in-use, while little attention has been paid to mature design (prototypes) or early implementation (content templates). In conclusion, we recommend an update to the framework so that it can be also useful for research in prototyping and early organizational implementation.",

abstract="With the advent of information digitization, virtual social networking, and other means of information sharing protocols, today billions of data are available on the World Wide Web from heterogeneous sources. All these data further contribute to the emergence of Big Data gamut. When these data are processed further, we get a glimpse of information which gives some level of understanding on the subject or the matter (person, place, enterprise, etc.). Knowledge is cohesively logically processed related information with the intellect to give us multidimensional information spectrum for decision-making in real time. In today's global environment, data plays crucial role to understand the social, cultural, behavioral, and demographic attributes of a subject. Knowledge-as-a-Service (KAAS) is a pioneering cloud framework inheriting the ``Internet of Things'' principles that extract data from various sources in a seamless manner and can further decouple--couple logically processed information based on the ``matching chromosome'' algorithm. Unified Resource Descriptor (URD) is an innovative information modeling technique that operates over KAAS framework to further publish knowledge on the subject on need basis. Based on this concept, every resource or subject is assigned a unique identifier that can perform multilayered search in the KAAS Database to extract relevant knowledge frames. Considering India's context, second most populated country in the world, URD can play an indispensable role to tighten information dynamics holistically and accumulate a broader spectrum of knowledge of the resource to address adverse situations (natural calamity, medication, insurance, etc.), business process solution (Banking, BPOs, KPOs, etc.), and research practices.",

Big data analytics in healthcare is cumbersome not just because of its volume but also because of the diversity of data types and the speed at which it is generated and must be managed/analyzed. Rapid progress is to be made for analyzing this data and for gleaning new insights for making better informed decisions. There are unprecedented opportunities to use big data.

abstract="In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.",

abstract="The importance of context in many recent software engineering research studies has been rising significantly. Injecting context awareness into software systems has facilitated multiple facets of modelling, increasing user satisfaction, and increased the level of User Interface (UI) intelligence. Context has been a major part of traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI), lately however, it is being deployed to a wider spectrum of research topics such as human cognition, the internet of things, software usability and many others. In this paper, a new context-aware method for emergency applications is introduced. An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to life, health, property or environment. There is an obvious gap in applying context to such critical cases; this paper shows that context awareness in user interfaces can play an important role with notifications and improving human reactions during such unfortunate and unforeseen incidents. The proposed method is evaluated through live emergency drills and simulations, the experimental results are presented.",

To ensure the safety and reliability of software embedded in these devices, rigorous model-based design methodologies are called for. Quantitative verification, a powerful technique for analysing system models against quantitative properties such as ``the probability of a data packet being delivered within 1ms to a nearby Bluetooth device is at least 0.98'', has proved useful by detecting and correcting flaws in a number of ubiquitous computing applications. In this paper, we focus on three key aspects of ubiquitous computing: autonomous behaviour, constrained resources and adaptiveness. We summarise recent advances of quantitative verification in relation to these aspects, illustrating each with a case study analysed using the probabilistic model checker PRISM.

abstract="Based on Neuser's conception of knowledge (Neuser, Wissen begreifen. Zur Selbstorganisation von Erfahrung, Handlung und Begriff. Springer, Heidelberg, 2013) a new characterization of morals is given which transfers the structure of knowledge to morals. This transformation is designed in a way such that the dynamic role of the inner functionalities is preserved. As a consequence a methodology evolves which explains the rise of morals in a society and at the same time identifies the factors that govern its internal dynamics. Especially, the influences of it-structures and technologies on the rise and change of morality can then be clearly understood. This approach thus prepares the conceptual grounds for questions of orientation, self-reassurance, and self-positioning of a society in view of the technological development.",

abstract="This paper presents a platform enabling the systematic exploitation of diverse, free-text data sources for public health surveillance applications. The platform relies on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a micro-services architecture, utilizing Linked Data as a data representational formalism. In order to perform NLP in an extendable and modular fashion, the proposed platform employs the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) and semantically annotates the results through a newly developed UIMA Semantic Common Analysis Structure Consumer (SCC). The SCC output is a graph represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) based on the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) and SNOMED-CT. We also present the use of the proposed platform through an exemplar application scenario concerning the detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals using data retrieved from PubMed and Twitter.",

abstract="Cars of the future (ADAS -- Autonomous self-driving assistant) will need to cover a number of new standards for mechatronic design and networking of the car in the cloud. This includes job roles for ISO 26262, IEC 61508 (functional safety), SAE J3061 (cybersecurity), etc. For instance, a car driving on a street will exchange information with neighbouring cars and learn the right steering angle, speed, etc. while the driver is using the car like a work place. Manufacturers plan to produce from 2030 only cars which have such a self-driving function incorporated. The design of new electric cars will require new infrastructures, new energy management, new battery concepts, and also new materials design (light weight and still resistant), and the job role pool will include these key skills as well. The production of cars will be with connected plants, robots to be programmed, and central production servers to coordinate the industry 4.0 type of production virtually across the world. And the new cybersecurity norm SAE J3061 will develop further in the next years because by moving the cars to the cloud and the production to industry 4.0 leaves Europe's industry vulnerable to attacks if this is not handled. Also the medical systems move towards an IoT (Internet of Things) approach where people receive implants which read out the data and transport them to the mobile which forwards the data to a medical service in the cloud where data are used by states and hospitals.",

abstract="Within the last decade, Security became a major focus in the traditional IT-Industry, mainly through the interconnection of systems and especially through the connection to the Internet. This opened up a huge new attack surface, which resulted in major takedowns of legitimate services and new forms of crime and destruction. This led to the development of a multitude of new defense mechanisms and strategies, as well as the establishing of Security procedures on both, organizational and technical level. Production systems have mostly remained in isolation during these past years, with security typically focused on the perimeter. Now, with the introduction of new paradigms like Industry 4.0, this isolation is questioned heavily with Physical Production Systems (PPSs) now connected to an IT-world resulting in cyber-physical systems sharing the attack surface of traditional web based interfaces while featuring completely different goals, parameters like lifetime and safety, as well as construction. In this work, we present an outline on the major security challenges faced by cyber-physical production systems. While many of these challenges harken back to issues also present in traditional web based IT, we will thoroughly analyze the differences. Still, many new attack vectors appeared in the past, either in practical attacks like Stuxnet, or in theoretical work. These attack vectors use specific features or design elements of cyber-physical systems to their advantage and are unparalleled in traditional IT. Furthermore, many mitigation strategies prevalent in traditional IT systems are not applicable in the industrial world, e.g., patching, thus rendering traditional strategies in IT-Security unfeasible. A thorough discussion of the major challenges in CPPS-Security is thus required in order to focus research on the most important targets.",

abstract="In the era of the Internet of Things, smart electronic devices facilitate processes in our everyday lives. Texas Instrument's MSP430 microcontrollers target low-power applications, among which are wireless sensor, metering and medical applications. Those domains have in common that sensitive data is processed, which calls for strong security primitives to be implemented on those devices. Curve25519, which builds on a 255-bit prime field, has been proposed as an efficient, highly-secure elliptic-curve. While its high performance on powerful processors has been shown, the question remains, whether it is suitable for use in embedded devices. In this paper we present an implementation of Curve25519 for MSP430 microcontrollers. To combat timing attacks, we completely avoid conditional jumps and loads, thus making our software constant time. We give a comprehensive evaluation of different implementations of the modular multiplication and show which ones are favorable for different conditions. We further present implementation results of Curve25519, where our best implementation requires 9.1 million or 6.5 million cycles on MSP430Xs having a                                                                                   {\$}{\$}16{\backslash}times 16{\$}{\$}                  -bit or a                                                                                   {\$}{\$}32{\backslash}times 32{\$}{\$}                  -bit hardware multiplier respectively.",

The vast majority of applications require using video cameras as main sensor for acquisition, analysis and detection of human motion. Some applications are very sensitive to the acquisition of images of people that may feel violated his right to privacy. Especially in ambient intelligence applications, non intrusive nature, whose scope is the user's home. The scope of this work was constrained to the analysis of human motion obtained from signals acquired for PIR sensors. We propose a method to classify PIR signals regarding two parameters: speed and distance from sensor to the subject. Our method allows to get compact devices that perform local computation and are able to transmit middle abstraction level context information in an efficient way. Signals from a PIR sensor array generated by several subjects have been registered to get patterns. Subjects moved at a certain speed at a given distance from sensors, so patterns are indexed by these two parameters. The patterns are then used to classify other tests signals regarding the mentioned parameters. The hit rate, for the method which combines information from all the sensors in the array, results in 79{\%} for distance classification, 96{\%} for speed classification and 77{\%} for classification regarding both parameters simultaneously. We consider that this is a satisfying result for a non intrusive method.",

Such domains, apparently unrelated, all ask for a suitable tradeoff between flexibility and regulation. In this light, compliance checking emerged as an effective way to understand whether an observed course of interaction agrees with what is expected by a model of the system. In this paper, we single out a non exhaustive list of desiderata and challenges for compliance checking applied at runtime. We then argue that methods, tools and techniques of Computational Logic, and Abductive Reasoning in particular, can be fruitfully exploited to tackle all such challenges in a formally grounded, computationally effective way.",

Our contribution is an automatic method which processes simultaneously spatial, temporal and frequency information contained in EEG recordings in order to remove eye blink related information. The proposed method is compared with a matrix based removal method and shows promising results regarding reconstruction error and retaining the texture of the artifact free signal.",

IBM Watson is one of the most famous and used: it offers, among others, a lot of services for Natural Language Processing. In spite of broad-scale multi-language services, most of functions are not available in a lot of ``secondary'' languages (like Italian). The main objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a translation-based approach to emotion recognition in texts written in ``secondary'' languages.

abstract="[Context/Background]: With the increasing use of cyber-physical systems in complex socio-technical setups, mechanisms that hold specific entities accountable for safety and security incidents are needed. Although there exist models that try to capture and formalize accountability concepts, many of these lack practical implementations. We hence know little about how accountability mechanisms work in practice and how specific entities could be held responsible for incidents. [Goal]: As a step towards the practical implementation of providing accountability, this systematic mapping study investigates existing implementations of accountability concepts with the goal to (1) identify a common definition of accountability and (2) identify the general trend of practical research. [Method]: To survey the literature for existing implementations, we conducted a systematic mapping study. [Results]: We thus contribute by providing a systematic overview of current accountability realizations and requirements for future accountability approaches. [Conclusions]: We find that existing practical accountability research lacks a common definition of accountability in the first place. The research field seems rather scattered with no generally accepted architecture and/or set of requirements. While most accountability implementations focus on privacy and security, no safety-related approaches seem to exist. Furthermore, we did not find excessive references to relevant and related concepts such as reasoning, log analysis and causality.",

Their complexity ranges widely, depending on the nature of the patient's condition and the prescribed substance(s). In today's IT supported clinical environments, prescriptions are often authored electronically. Patient adherence to the prescribed medication regimen is a key determinant for the outcome of the intervention. Recently, an increasing number of information technologies are entering the consumer market with a goal to assist patients with adhering to their prescriptions. The effectiveness (and safety) of these technologies is limited to simplistic cases, however, because of the lack of a precise semantics for more complex prescription orders. To close this gap, we present an approach to formalize the meaning of medication prescriptions based on a graph-transformation system. This allows for more complex and variable prescriptions to be semantically coded and their adherence to be automatically monitored.

abstract="Autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, constitute the most common disabilities from a medical point of view. In others individual fields, the Assistive Technology use constitute a current option to improve the Quality of Life. In this case, the free available specialized software covers several competences of life, like language and communication, autonomy, sensorimotor, social skills, mathematics, knowledge of the natural and social environment, and digital competences. The objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of Android apps using Mobile Application Rating Scale. A systematic search using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was conducted using Google Play store as a base in August 2017. Evaluated apps were classified according to their respective competence of life. The results showed that the evaluated apps needed improvements in customization and interactivity. Also, an apps list based on Mobile Application Rating Scale scores, useful for therapist, parents, and people with disability has been established.",

abstract="The rapid growth of smartphone in recent years has resulted in many syndromes. Most of these syndromes are caused by excessive use of smartphone. In addition, people who tends to use smartphone excessively are also likely to have smartphone addiction. In this paper, we presented the system architecture for e-Health system. Not only we used the architecture for our smartphone addiction recognition system, but we also pointed out important benefits of the system architecture, which also can be adopted by other system. Later on, we presented a development of the classification model for recognizing likelihood of having smartphone addiction. We trained the classification model based on data retrieved from subjects' smartphone. The result showed that the best model can correctly classify the instance up to 78{\%}.",

abstract="Current demographic trends indicate that there is a growing number of older population groups worldwide, which is associated with an increase of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which burden the country's healthcare system. Therefore there is an urgent call for developing efficient strategies which could reduce the healthcare costs and meet the demand of older ill people at affordable cost. One of such approaches is the use of mobile devices and applications. The purpose of this study is to explore mobile devices and/or mobile applications which are used in the assessment, management and treatment of Parkinson's disease. The methods used in this study include a literature review of available sources found in the world's acknowledged databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, as well as the methods of comparison and evaluation of the findings from the selected studies were applied. The findings show that mobile devices and smart-based apps can serve as an appropriate assessment, diagnostic, monitoring and treatment tools for patients with PD since they are relatively cost-effective, reliable and non-invasive. However, more research has to be done in the area of their use in the treatment of PD symptoms, as well as more randomized controlled trials with larger samples of subjects should be conducted.",

abstract="Selecting security mechanisms for complex software systems is a cumbersome process. The presence of multiple goals and architectural components, as well as cost and performance considerations, render decision-making a crucial but complicated aspect of a system's design. In our work, we extend Secure Tropos, a security requirements engineering methodology, by introducing the concept of Risk in order to facilitate the elicitation and analysis of security requirements and also support a systematic risk assessment process during the system's design time. Next, we use Constrained Goal Models to reason about optimal security mechanism combinations with respect to multiple objectives of the system-to-be, taking into account conflicting functional and non-functional goals. This type of reasoning allows combining linear multi-objective optimisation with logical constraints introduced by the system's stakeholders. Finally, we illustrate the application of approach through a real-world case study from the e-government sector.",

abstract="The proportion of elderly people over 65 years old has rapidly increased, and social costs related to aging population problems have grown globally. The governments want to reduce these social costs through advanced technologies. The physician or medical center evaluates health conditions from the reports of elderly people. However, self-reports are often inaccurate, and sometimes reports by family or caregivers can be more accurate. To solve these problems, an evaluated objective method based on sensor data is needed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven smart home system that uses web technologies for connecting sensors and actuators. The proposed system provides a method of monitoring elderly people's daily activities using commercial sensors to register recognizable activities easily. In addition, it controls actuators in the home by using user-defined rules and shows a summary of elderly people's activities to monitor them.",

abstract="The speed and the efficiency of short range communication has increased with the evolution of wireless technologies i.e. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), ZigBee, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Especially, the BLE shows promising results in different fields such as Internet of Things (IoT), health-care, body area networks, etc. As a result of dramatic increase in the wireless device, the frequency interference in 2.4 GHz Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band has raised, resulting a higher packet loss. In this paper, we propose Fast Adaptive Frequency Hopping Scheme (FAFH) to mitigate the effects of interference in BLE. The proposed FAFH scheme immediately hops to a new channel without waiting for completion of the current connection event when the channel quality becomes worse by interference. The simulation results show that the FAFH performs better in dense wireless networks as well as improved performances comparing to AFH scheme.",

abstract="Cyber-physical systems are generally composed of several software components executing on different processors that are interconnected through entities that can be represented as buses. These complex systems collocate functions operating at different security levels, which can introduce unexpected interactions that affect system security. The security policy for these systems is realized through various complex physical or logical mechanisms. The security policy, as a stakeholder goal, is then refined into system requirements and implementation constraints that are used to guarantee security objectives. Unfortunately, verifying the correct decomposition and its enforcement in the system architecture is an overwhelming task. To overcome these issues, requirements must be clearly specified and traced through the system architecture, and automatically verified throughout the development process.",

abstract="The nested Petri nets are a nets-within-nets formalism convenient for modelling systems that consist of distributed mobile agents with individual behaviour. The formalism is supported by developed verification methods based on structural analysis and model checking techniques. Time constraints are crucial for many safety critical and everyday IoT systems. Recently, the non Turing-complete time semantics for Time Petri nets based on restricted urgency was suggested; and, it was shown that some behavioural analysis problems are decidable under the semantics. In the paper, the semantics is extended to the nested Petri nets formalism and it was demonstrated that some behavioural analysis problems are still decidable. The semantics is illustrated by an example of a health monitoring system.",

abstract="In pervasive healthcare services, the efficient management of the large number of monitored data from various wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) in terms of processing, storing and analysis is an important problem. Now, cloud computing is becoming a promising technology to provide a flexible stack of massive computing, storage and software services in a scalable and virtualized manner at low cost. In this article, we try to investigate and overcome these issues associated with WBSN-cloud integration (abbr. bCloud) platform. For this purpose, we design a novel system architecture for the general bCloud platform, and then propose the methodologies for quality of service (QoS) improvement, including three directions: reliable and energy efficient routing protocols for WBSNs, effective QoS-aware novel resource allocation model for the bCloud platform, and efficient data mining for extracting behavioral regularity from WBSN data. The proposed methodologies to design bCloud platform will facilitate the better pervasive healthcare.",

Many research works have been focusing on the wireless communication level to obtain quality of service. This paper widens the problem, and provides a comprehensive system design, where it covers all the elements in a remote health monitoring application. The system collects measurements in a relational database, either through a C{\#}.NET or a LabVIEW program. The end-user is able to observe either real-time data (i.e. with insignificant delay) or processed historical data on any web browser. We have shown that the inclusion of the relational database may impose a need for the data to be buffered before inserting into the database within a single transaction, but the buffering does not entail delays bigger than 50 ms.",

abstract="Remote healthcare centers located in sub-Saharan of Africa are still facing a shortage of healthcare practitioners, yielding long queue of patients in waiting rooms during several hours. This situation increases the risk that critical patients are consulted too late, motivating the importance of priority-based patient scheduling systems. This paper presents the design of a Multi-Priority Triage Chair (MPTC) to be installed at the entrance of patient's waiting rooms such that each new patient first sits in the MPTC to measure its vital signs and register his/her other priority parameters such as arrival time, travel time or distance between the concerned center and its home, and so on. The proposed MPTC will then update in real-time the consultation planning in order to statistically minimize (i) the number of critical patients not treated within a pre-defined waiting time, (ii) the number of patients waiting for more than a pre-defined period and (iii) the number of patients living relatively far who gets their consultation postponed to another day.",

abstract="This paper argues that there is a need for an awareness and education about privacy literacy in an age where lifelogging technologies are ubiquitous and open up private data to commercial and other uses, wherein commercial entities build up huge digital libraries of private data that they then mine with big data analytics. Often, data is represented as if they are the raw material of information and algorithms, and as neutral agents for processing these pieces of information, but in our digital society, this so-called neutral data can become open data that can be processed easily to reveal informational metadata on individuals' behaviors. Whilst much of this may be beyond individual control, and simply an unavoidable part of our information society, there are certain types of personal and private data that can be, and need to be, under individual control, and not open to integration or `hashing' with public data. This requires a new type of data literacy on the part of users that we term as privacy literacy.",

abstract="Recent developments in science and technology (S{\&}T), coupled with universal access to content information via internet have inspired both state- and non-state-sponsored actors to new levels of creativity in the development of unconventional and non-traditional weapons. Remote access to critical infra-structure, global links using faster means of transport, and unmanned aerial vehicles have decentralized the traditional nature of battlefield. Threat vectors have become increasingly asymmetric, highly kinetic, undefined and randomly non-linear. Implementation of effective countermeasures necessitates an advanced understanding of emerging security challenges and transformational concepts conjoining nexus of S{\&}T and their full potential beyond traditional capabilities. Recent progress in reduced and multi-dimensional materials coupled with advanced synthesis methods have significantly contributed to sensor platforms capable of direct detection of chem.-bio agents in a label-free, parallel, and multiplexed format with broad dynamic range, allowing in-situ and accurate detection of multiple agents with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the use of bio-mimetic materials is a game-changing technology as it provides ultra-sensitive reconnaissance and remote maneuverability for missions in combat theatres. The development of integrated solution pathways using ecosystem of technological innovations provides tactical superiority in support of effective countermeasures and opportunities in identifying emerging and unconventional threats vectors.",

abstract="We propose a novel semi-supervised learning method for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNN is one of the most popular models for deep learning and its successes among various types of applications include image and speech recognition, image captioning, and the game of `go'. However, the requirement for a vast amount of labeled data for supervised learning in CNNs is a serious problem. Unsupervised learning, which uses the information of unlabeled data, might be key to addressing the problem, although it has not been investigated sufficiently in CNN regimes. The proposed method involves both supervised and unsupervised learning in identical feedforward networks, and enables seamless switching among them. We validated the method using an image recognition task. The results showed that learning using non-labeled data dramatically improves the efficiency of supervised learning.",

However, mobile devices still do not have the computing power and battery life that will allow them to perform effectively over long periods of time or for executing applications that require extensive communication or computation, or low latency. Cyber-foraging is a technique to enable mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in single-hop proximity. This paper presents the preliminary results of a systematic literature review (SLR) on architectures that support cyber-foraging.

abstract="There are many different open source real-time operating systems (RTOS) available, and the use of open source software (OSS) for safety-critical applications is considered highly interesting by industrial domains such as medical, aerospace and automotive, as it potentially enables lower costs and more flexibility. In order to use OSS in a safety-critical context, however, evidence that the software fulfills the requirements put forth in a functional safety standard for the relevant domain is necessary. However, the standards for functional safety typically do not provide a clear method for how one would go about certifying systems containing OSS. Therefore, in this paper we identify some important RTOS characteristics and outline a methodology which can be used to assess the suitability of an open source RTOS for use in a safety-critical application. A case study is also carried out, comparing two open source operating systems using the identified characteristics. The most suitable candidate is then assessed in order to see to what degree it can adhere with the requirements put forth in the widely used functional safety standard IEC 61508.",

abstract="We present an intelligent data management framework that can facilitate development of highly scalable and mobile healthcare applications for remote monitoring of patients. This is achieved through the use of a global log data abstraction that leverages the storage and processing capabilities of the edge devices and the cloud in a seamless manner. In existing log based storage systems, data is read as fixed size chunks from the cloud to enhance performance. However, in healthcare applications, where the data access pattern of the end users differ widely, this approach leads to unnecessary storage and cost overheads. To overcome these, we propose dynamic log chunking. The experimental results, comparing existing fixed chunking against the H-Plane model, show 13 {\%}--19 {\%} savings in network bandwidth as well as cost while fetching the data from the cloud.",

abstract="Anonymisation based on t-closeness is a privacy-preserving method of publishing micro-data that is safe from skewness, and similarity attacks. The t-closeness privacy requirement for publishing micro-data requires that the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in an equivalence class, and the distribution of sensitive attributes in the whole micro-data set, be no greater than a threshold value of t. An equivalence class is a set records that are similar with respect to certain identifying attributes (quasi-identifiers), and a micro-data set is said to be t-close when all such equivalence classes satisfy t-closeness. However, the t-closeness anonymisation problem is NP-Hard. As a performance efficient alternative, we propose a t-clustering algorithm with an average time complexity of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}O(m^{\{}2{\}} {\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}                   where n and m are the number of tuples and attributes, respectively.

abstract="Ensuring machine health and predicting failures beforehand is of utmost importance. Fog networking is an emerging paradigm of computing. Advances in neural networks research and their benefits in accurate classification make them best candidate for application to prognostics. Ubiquity of smartphones, wearables and sensors is giving rise to tremendous amount of data necessitating intelligent data analytics at the data center. Various researches have focused on compression of large deep models for inferencing on smart devices in order to seek answers to issues like reducing the enormity of computation, decreasing the power and memory requirements on these devices. At this point in time, state of the art in inference such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) seem impossible to be implemented on resource constrained devices. Cloud based inference incurs cost in terms of power as more energy is depleted to access infrastructure via technologies such as 3g/4g networks while also witnessing latency issues due to network congestion. A few real world situations offload inferencing to network edge as it is more beneficial to solve many issues like security, privacy of users, redundancy rather than uploading enormous volume of data on cloud. The paradigm, known as Fog Computing, is a hot topic in research facilitating edge analytics by overcoming constraints and shortcoming of cloud enabling quality of service (QoS) required in some real world applications such as Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Fog acts as a medium between edge device and cloud. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach of using Fog in conjunction with deep neural nets for inferencing. We propose how neural nets exploited by Fog/Cloudlet can provide computational and storage services to nearby devices and it will also put a barrier by filtering the voluminous data to a reduced form for cloud.",

abstract="One of the main challenges in urban computing is to interpret the behaviors of the individuals, and so to provide services for suppling their needs. Data mining offers very powerful tools that can be used to analyze data in urban environments. Our research uses the UrbanContext roles model to identify the states of the individuals within urban environments. Then, it applies supervised classification data mining techniques to the results obtained, and uses decision trees in order to facilitate the analysis of the individuals' behavior. Finally, we present the prediction results obtained from a study made about the roles that individuals adopt depending on their context. From these data we successfully predict the different types of services we can offer in an urban environment.",

abstract="Sociomateriality is gaining momentum and is by now characterized as a research stream in the information system field. Although some definitions emerged, there is still uncertainty about how to conceptually and analytically address sociomateriality. The debate ranges from understanding sociomateriality as just a fancy word for technology to treating it as a de-facto theory of the human-technology relationship. To bring the field forward, a common basic understanding of what sociomateriality entails is needed. In this paper we set out to contribute to such an understanding. We do this by conducting a systematic mapping study of emerging concepts and definitions in the current empirical body of literature on sociomateriality. Our analysis finds three key resulting facets: mutuality (what is a sociomaterial assemblage?), performativity (how does it perform?), and multidimensionality (When and where does it perform?). Our findings outline how sociomaterial studies analytically and methodologically address performativity spanning across time and space.",

We set the IoT system with lower number of sensors. The key data for identifying activity comes from widely used smart sockets. It first took residents' acceptability into consideration to set the IoT system, then used a seamless indoor position system to get residents' position to help recognize the undergoing activities. Based on ontology, it made use of domain knowledge in daily activity and built an activity ontology. The system took real home situation into consideration and make full use of both electric and electronic appliances' data into the context awareness.

abstract="The use of smart devices is increasing rapidly; this trend is changing the paradigm in which notifications are delivered to users. Smart devices are important to provide user awareness. However, their use must be controlled and human perception should be considered to avoid information overload. In this paper, we present a dynamic mechanism to coordinate the distribution of notification across smart devices. This personalized notification mechanism uses an inference engine and a set of rules to generate notification alternatives and select the ``best'' one. A continuous refinement approach is also used to improve notification delivery. Our system was evaluated and the baseline rules were established by 11 expert users. The main results show that in some scenarios, the notification mechanism selection converged quickly and results are promising. However, further work is required to provide not only personalized but integrated (i.e., more than one device at the time) notification management.",

The paper then sheds light on the theme of socially challenging situations, which is elaborated through two workshops, and defines the core areas of focus. Further, a low-fidelity prototype for the safety of children is created and evaluated in a small-scale user experiment.

However, little work has been done to evaluate this performance in terms of their power consumption behavior under different traffic types. This paper investigates and quantifies the impact of traffic type (TCP and CBR) on the power consumption, network throughput and end to end delay in MANET using OPNET Modeler 17.1 network simulator. Simulation results show that AODV/CBR recorded the lowest power consumption after 900 s of continuous packet transmission as compare to AODV/TCP, DSR/CBR and DSR/TCP. Also, AODV/CBR deliver the optimum performance in all other chosen metrics, thus a better choice for an efficient and power aware routing protocol in MANET.",

abstract="In order to efficiently use node's energy and prolong node's life time in wireless sensor networks (WSN), this paper presents a low redundancy and high coverage (LRHC) node scheduling algorithm. In LRHC, based on the characteristics of the cellular, the WSN network is divided into a number of cellular to help the selection of active nodes. A new triangle cover method has been theoretically analyzed and proposed to solve the coverage holes problem for the first time. In addition, during the scheduling, a new active node will be the substitute for the active node near to death, which guarantees the stability of network coverage quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LRHC algorithm reduces the required nodes to satisfy a certain coverage quality, and improves the life time and ensures the high coverage quality of the network compared with some existing algorithms.",

Increasingly, modern IT systems form networks of humans and machines that interact with one another. As machines take a more active role in such networks, they exert an increasing level of influence on other participants. We review the existing literature on agency and propose a definition of agency that is practical for describing the capabilities and impact human and machine actors may have in a human-machine network. On this basis, we discuss and demonstrate the impact and trust implications for machine actors in human-machine networks for emergency decision support, healthcare and future smart homes. We maintain that machine agency not only facilitates human to machine trust, but also interpersonal trust; and that trust must develop to be able to seize the full potential of future technology.",

abstract="Side-channel attacks represent a powerful category of attacks against cryptographic devices. Still, side-channel analysis for lightweight ciphers is much less investigated than for instance for AES. Although intuition may lead to the conclusion that lightweight ciphers are weaker in terms of side-channel resistance, that remains to be confirmed and quantified. In this paper, we consider various side-channel analysis metrics which should provide an insight on the resistance of lightweight ciphers against side-channel attacks. In particular, for the non-profiled scenario we use the theoretical confusion coefficient and empirical correlation power analysis. Furthermore, we conduct a profiled side-channel analysis using various machine learning attacks on PRESENT and AES. Our results show that the difference between AES and lightweight ciphers is smaller than one would expect. Interestingly, we observe that the studied 4-bit S-boxes have a different side-channel resilience, while the difference in the 8-bit ones is only theoretically present.",

abstract="With the growing popularity of IoT nowadays, tremendous amount of time series data at high resolution is being generated, transmitted, stored, and processed by modern sensor networks in different application domains, which naturally incurs extensive storage and computation cost in practice. Data compression is the key to resolve such challenge, and various compression techniques, either lossless or lossy, have been proposed and widely adopted in industry and academia. Although existing approaches are generally successful, we observe a unique characteristic in certain time series data, i.e., significant periodicity and strong randomness, which leads to poor compression performance using existing methods and hence calls for a specifically designed compression mechanism that can utilise the periodic and stochastic patterns at the same time. To this end, we propose a decomposition-based compression algorithm which divides the original time series into several components reflecting periodicity and randomness respectively, and then approximates each component accordingly to guarantee overall compression ratio and maximum error. We conduct extensive evaluation on a real world dataset, and the experimental results verify the superiority of our proposals compared with current state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract="Assets are complex mixes of complex systems, built from components which, over time, may fail. The ability to quickly and efficiently determine the cause of failures and propose optimum maintenance decisions, while minimizing the need for human intervention is necessary. Thus, for complex assets, much information needs to be captured and mined to assess the overall condition of the whole system. Therefore the integration of asset information is required to get an accurate health assessment of the whole system, and determine the probability of a shutdown or slowdown. Moreover, the data collected are not only huge but often dispersed across independent systems that are difficult to access, fuse and mine due to disparate nature and granularity. If the data from these independent systems are combined into a common correlated data source, this new set of information could add value to the individual data sources by the means of data mining. This paper proposes a knowledge discovery process based on CRISP-DM for failure diagnosis using big data sets. The process is exemplified by applying it on railway infrastructure assets.

abstract="Emerging information technologies and application patterns in modern information society, e.g., Internet, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Tri-network Convergence, are growing in an amazing speed which causes the advent of the era of Big Data. Big Data is often described by using five V's: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity. Exploring efficient and effective data mining and knowledge discovery methods to handle Big Data with rich information has become an important research topic in the area of information science. This paper focuses on the introduction of our solution, PICKT, on big data analysis based on the theories of granular computing and rough sets, where P refers to parallel/cloud computing for the Volume, I refers to incremental learning for the Velocity, C refers to composite rough set model for the Variety, K refers to knowledge discovery for the Value and T refers to three-way decisions for the Veracity of Big Data.",

abstract="Repository-based development of software systems has gained more attention recently by addressing new challenges such as security and dependability. However, there are still gaps in existing modeling languages and/or formalisms dedicated to define model repositories and the way how to reuse them in the automation of software development. Thus, there is a strong requirement for defining a model repository description language not only as a modeling approach, but also as a suitable instrument to support system and software engineers in the activity of search and retrieval of appropriate models beyond keyword-based search. Moreover, modeling approaches allow using tools for the specification and the exploitation of the designed artifacts (e.g. analysis and evaluation). The goal of this paper is to advance the state of the art in model repository description for software and systems engineering. In particular, we have designed a flexible and extensible modeling language, by means of an OMG style metamodel, to specify model repositories for modeling artifacts, and we have defined an operational architecture for development tools. In particular, we show the feasibility of our own approach by reporting some preliminary prototype providing a model-based repository of security and dependability (S{\&}D) pattern models.",

pages="214--234",
abstract="Privacy-preserving data mining technologies have been studied extensively, and as a general approach, du Pin Calmon and Fawaz have proposed a data distortion mechanism based on a statistical inference attack framework. This theory has been extended by Erdogdu et al. to time-series data and been applied to energy disaggregation of smart-meter data. However, their theory assumes both smart-meter data and sensitive appliance state information are available when applying the privacy-preserving mechanism, which is impractical in typical smart-meter systems where only the total power usage is available. In this paper, we extend their approach to enable the application of a privacy-utility tradeoff mechanism to such practical applications. Firstly, we define a system model which captures both the architecture of the smart-meter system and the practical constraints that the power usage of each appliance cannot be measured individually. This enables us to formalize the tradeoff problem more rigorously. Secondly, we propose a privacy-utility tradeoff mechanism for that system. We apply a linear Gaussian model assumption to the system and thereby reduce the problem of obtaining unobservable information to that of learning the system parameters. Finally, we conduct experiments of applying the proposed mechanism to the power usage data of an actual household. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism works partly effectively; i.e., it prevents usage analysis of certain types of sensitive appliances while at the same time preserving that of non-sensitive appliances.",

abstract="Recently, Alkim, Ducas, P{\"o}ppelmann, and Schwabe proposed a Ring-LWE-based key exchange protocol called ``NewHope '' [2] and illustrated that this protocol is very efficient on large Intel processors. Their paper also claims that the parameter choice enables efficient implementation on small embedded processors. In this paper we show that these claims are actually correct and present NewHope software for the ARM Cortex-M family of 32-bit microcontrollers. More specifically, our software targets the low-end Cortex-M0 and the high-end Cortex-M4 processor from this family. Our software starts from the C reference implementation by the designers of NewHope and then carefully optimizes subroutines in assembly. In particular, compared to best results known so far, our NTT implementation achieves a speedup of almost a factor of 2 on the Cortex-M4. Our Cortex-M0 NTT software slightly outperforms previously best results on the Cortex-M4, a much more powerful processor. In total, the server side of the key exchange executes in only 1 467 101 cycles on the M0 and only 834524 cycles on the M4; the client side executes in 1 760 837 cycles on the M0 and 982 384 cycles on the M4.",

In this work, we propose PROtEUS: an integrated system for process execution in cyber-physical systems. PROtEUS is able to bridge the gap between hardware-related processes and human-centered workflows. It enables the integration of sensor data from various sources into model-based processes, the flexible access to heterogeneous resources, as well as user interactions in processes.

The RI-MDS method is centralized, and mainly focuses on improving localization accuracy. It collects RSSI vectors as ranging basis, and combines the metric-MDS method and the nonmetric MDS method to accomplish the relative localization. Then it uses the maximum likelihood method in affine transformation to transform the relative coordinates to absolute ones. Our method has no need for additional equipment on the WSN nodes. Simulation and field experiments show that the average localization error and the localization error ratio of the RI-MDS method is relatively lower, thus it is more feasible.",

abstract="Socially intelligent virtual agents are a promising solution to the increasing challenges of eldercare. This article describes an autonomous conversational agent system, simulating human-like affective behaviour to act as a daily life companion for older adults living at home. We present results from a user-centred design study that informed the design of the companion. The interaction with the user is based on a multimodal interface including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a graphical touch-based user interface. The companion offers support to older adults by locating objects, offering reminders, and guidance with household activities. It also supports emergency detection and handling. We present the companion's architecture and key components as well as the affective interaction paradigm and its implementation in the multimodal user interface. We conducted an exploratory evaluation study where the companion was introduced in 20 homes of older adults (aged 65+) in two EU countries. For a total duration of 12 weeks, various scenarios were tested, covering different types of interactions and tasks that occur in daily life. Qualitative and quantitative data on acceptance, perceived usability, and usefulness yield rich information on how agents perform in real-world settings and which factors influence their success in this context. We reflect on the results of the evaluation study in terms of lessons learned and discuss future opportunities for fellow researchers who are striving to bring virtual agents out of the laboratories into successful real world applications.",

However, well-designed service composition approaches always lacks the consideration of execution environment, and the approach designed for application execution is usually incomplete and lacking necessary business consideration. In order to improve the comprehensiveness covered both design and execution stages, a service composition approach based on process mining is proposed. First, a meta-model is designed to connect the information of execution environment and business requirement. Next, the scene model based on this meta-model is generated by leveraging process mining. Then the scene model is applied to do service composition, including service selection from the Service Registry. After that, BPEL instance is converted based on aggregated scene information so as to enable application execution. Finally, a cloud-based logistics platform is implemented to verify the approach, and the result shows that the approach has high requirement accuracy and execution effectiveness.",

Thus, in the eighteenth century, Lavoisier, using mathematics to explain chemical reactions and express the law of mass conservation, brought chemistry into modernity. At the dawn of the twentieth century, another revolution resulted from the discovery of laws specific to properties at the atomic scale, which made it possible to understand, for instance, the laser effect, on which our modern technology is based, from medicine to defense and metrology to everyday items such as optical drives, microcomputers, and GPS. However, the values that set up our societies hardly fit the increasing speed of technological progresses. This lack of necessary distance for a more thoughtful judgment leads both to the unreasoned rejection of acquired progress such as vaccination and to harmful over-appropriation of information communication techniques when they lack the necessary critical analysis. It is therefore essential, in view of the rapid growth of science and technology, to take time to think about the values we want to give to our societies.",

abstract="Digital economy has been considered a dominant way to sustain economic growth in developed countries for recent years. However in this field there is a huge gap between technology accumulation and technology application, i.e. technology application far falling short of accumulation. It is this huge gap that creates a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities for Chinese firms. Generally speaking, technology applications firstly depend on discovery of social problems as well as design of their solutions, thus most of entrepreneurial opportunities are social-problem oriented in essence. The authors, taking these tendencies into account in this article, deeply analyze the definition, characteristics and identification of entrepreneurial opportunities in digital economy, compare US Apple Corporate and China Changhong Corporate, and stress necessity of shifting the focus of innovation from technology orientation to a social-problem one. So in the huge markets of China, social problems should always be aimed at first, and customer demands found second, and solutions designed third, and finally key resources integrated for development of these solutions. It is believed that in digital economy this social-problem oriented innovation process can provide more entrepreneurial opportunities as well as more innovative products and services for innovators to construct dominant application paradigms, so to win battles of new technology commercialization.",

It is necessary for program managers to be able to assess the impacts of future technology and stakeholder changes. This research helps analyze sequential decisions in an evolving SoS architecture through three key features: SoS architecture generation, assessment and implementation through negotiation. Architectures are generated using evolutionary algorithms and assessed using type II fuzzy nets. The approach accommodates diverse stakeholder views, converting them to key performance parameters (KPPs) for architecture assessment. It is not possible to implement an acknowledged SoS architecture without persuading the systems to participate. A negotiation model is proposed to help the SoS manger adapt his strategy based on system owners' behavior. Viewpoints of multiple stakeholders are aggregated to assess the overall mission effectiveness of an architecture against the overarching objectives. A search and rescue (SAR) example illustrates application of the method. Future research might include group decision making for evaluating architectures.",

abstract="Data mining is becoming increasingly important in the data-driven society in recent years. Unfortunately, privacy of the individuals fails to be protected and considered deliberately. It's a significantly challenging question that outputs of data mining models can be applied to preserve privacy while simultaneously maintaining analyzing capability. With advancements in big data, series of big data computing platforms have evolved into widely utilized paradigms for data mining. However, users' sensitive data which are outsourced on the cloud and mined on open-sourced computing platform. It poses such severe threats that measures must be taken to protect the privacy of individuals' data. Regarding this issue, much fruitful work has been done on designing privacy preserving data mining approaches for improving big data computing platform security and privacy of individuals. In this paper, a systematic investigation of a wide array of the state-of-the-art privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) techniques has been performed from different aspects on threat model, anonymity, secure multiparty computation (SMC), differential privacy. We are focused on improving data privacy in these sensitive areas on big data computing platforms. Hopefully, our work aims to highlight the urgent need for applying privacy preserving data mining approaches on big data computing platforms. Moreover, a better understanding of this research area may benefit the usage of big data and future exploration.",

abstract="The use of Ambient-Assisted Living (AAL) systems has been spreading across several countries, with the ultimate purpose of improving the quality of life of patients. These systems often reflect complex architectures including several components such as sensors, gateways, Information Systems or even actuators, as well as messaging and transmitting protocols. Failures in these systems can have severe impact on a monitored patient, and most components foresee some kind of compensation countermeasures to increase reliability. Nevertheless, these measures are often self-contained to a single component and do not address the overall AAL system reliability, disregarding precedent and successor activities and interactions that exist for each time a certain value is registered or a certain alert is triggered. In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculate the overall reliability of an AAL system. We take a Business Process Management (BPM) approach to model the activities and interactions between AAL components, using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. By extending the BPMN standard to include reliability information, we can derive the overall reliability of a certain AAL system. To prove this approach, we also present a reliability study considering scenarios with single and pairwise reliability variations of AAL system components. With this approach, healthcare managers can benefit from important overall reliability information of an AAL system, and better allocate the appropriate resources (including hardware or health care professionals) to improve responsiveness of care to patients.",

Secondly, use new digital and collaborative tools, including geospatial sharing platforms and OpenStreetMap volunteers for sharing, collecting, and using data. Thirdly, build capacity through, for example, courses, exercises, and regional demonstrations.

abstract="The wide availability of high interconnection networks, powerful mobile devices and service-oriented architectures has paved the way for the delivery of cloud services. Moving information technology services to the cloud has imposed new ways of interaction with users. Users desire friendly looking, highly interactive, dynamically visualized and naturally controlled user interfaces (UI) that allow smooth navigation in the cloud space. Transferring the rich user interface of the desktop, where running the software dynamically online and instantly following up with social networking activities is relatively easy, to the web-browser on mobile devices is introducing many challenges. This has resulted in the emergence of innovative cloud services and implementation approaches specifically to handle the new user interface demands. However, a standardized consistent user interface metaphor for cloud services is still lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the cloud user interface requirements, special services, implementation trends, technologies and efforts for standardization.",

abstract="There are about 137,000 hearing-impaired children in 0−6 years old in China. Unfortunately, it has about 23,000 newborn hearing-impaired children each year. The number is far larger in the world. As a result of hearing impairment, children lost the ability to speak. The society should pay more attention to them. A number of methods and products have been developed. However, these products are more like laboratory instruments and lack of humane and fun. As a result, it has no appeal to children. Parents has a great influence to the training. So it requires time and effort from the parents and many parents may have to take time off from work [1]. Economic pressures increases the misfortune of each family. In the age of advocating the user experience, it is essential to understand the products from the perspective of hearing-impaired children and their families to increase interest of the product. Gamification design is a great solution that increases the interest of the speech training system. In this paper, we focus on the influence of different game mechanics of speech training system for hearing-impaired children combined with the theories of immersion, flow experience and performance. A self-service training system has been developed.",

abstract="As humans and machines generate a tremendous amount of digital data in their daily life, we are in the era of Big Data which poses unique challenges of storing, processing and analyzing this voluminous data. Sensors which continuously generate data are one important source of Big Data and have innumerous applications in real life scenario. As storing the entire data becomes expensive, summarization is the need of the hour. Data Summarization is a compact representation of the entire data which can reduce storage and processing requirements. In this work, we try to effectively summarize Sensor Data using simple but effective techniques such as sampling and clustering and analyze the performance of the summarized data in comparison to the complete dataset. Popular classification techniques like KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes are used to evaluate the efficiency of the summarization techniques by training the classifiers using the summarized data and testing with the test data set. The performance of the summarized dataset and the complete dataset are compared. The experimental results show that summarized data set performs almost equally well as the complete data set.",

The recent introduction of IoT (Internet of things) connected hearing instruments offer new opportunities for hearables to collect behavioral data that capture device usage and user intents and thereby provide insights to adjust the settings of the device. In our study 6 participants shared their volume and interaction data capturing when they remotely changed their device settings over eight weeks. The data confirms that the participants preferred to actively change programs rather than use a single default setting provided by an audiologist. Furthermore, their unique usage patterns indicate a need for designing hearing instruments, which as hearables adapt their settings dynamically to individual preferences during the day.",

Traditional resource-centric services computing paradigm tries to make use of mass customization approaches to fulfill customer demands in a cost-effective way, but sacrifices the personalization degree and decreases customer satisfaction. We propose a user-centric paradigm called ``Personal Service Eco-Environment (PSE2)'' which plays as a ``personal assistant'' of each user. PSE2 is composed of personal data, services, and social relations around a user, and fully-personalized service/social collaboration solutions are to be planned on the basis of the individualized characteristics extracted from his personal data and the dynamic multi-end context.

abstract="With the advent of public cloud services, enterprise are moving to adopt the lower cost, more flexible, scalable public cloud offerings like OTC, AWS and Azure. Simultaneously they are adapting their network models to move away from centralized enterprise QoS networks (with internet break out from a single or few large enterprise gateways) in favor of lower cost, direct offloading of corporate traffic from company locations via local and distributed Internet service providers. Using this model enterprises are also accessing cloud services from multiple entry points, and this completely changes the enterprise security deployment landscape. As an additional ongoing trend, the networking of physical devices is bringing a whole new `operational technology' domain to the enterprise space, and a new approach to enterprise security is therefore required. In this paper the drivers of change in approaches to security for public cloud computing are presented, considering also the responsibilities of the customer and of the cloud service provider and the component which enterprises still need to focus on. In addition, the network model for security is explained and considered, with the new distributed deployment zone for security as described. Cyber physical/IoT type systems are also then discussed as an additional security landscape over which enterprises increasingly need to take special care.",

abstract="Today's mobile and pervasive computing devices are embedded with increasingly powerful sensing capabilities that enable them to provide exceptional spatio-temporal context acquisition that is not possible with traditional static sensor networks alone. As a result, enabling these devices to share context information with one another has a great potential for enabling mobile users to exploit the nearby cyber and physical environments in participatory or human-centric computing. However, because these mobile devices are owned by and sense information about individuals, sharing the acquired context raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we define Magpie, which implements an alternative to existing all-or-nothing sharing solutions. Magpie integrates a decentralized context-dependent and adaptive trust scheme with a privacy preserving sharing mechanism to evaluate the risk of disclosing potentially private data. The proposed method uses this assessment to dynamically determine the sharing strategy and the quality of the context shared. Conceptually, Magpie allows devices to actively obfuscate context information so that sharing is still useful but does not breach user privacy. To our knowledge this is the first work to take both trust relationships and users' individual privacy sensitivities into account to balance sharing and privacy preservation. We describe Magpie and then evaluate it in a series of application-oriented experiments running on the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator.",

Specifically, by inducing two random cell faults into the input of the antepenultimate round, our attack reduces the secret key search space from                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}128{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          128                                                                                     to                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}32{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          32                                                                                     for Midori-128 and from                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}128{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          128                                                                                     to                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}80{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          80                                                                                     for Midori-64, respectively.

abstract="While current reliable and ultra low latency industrial communication is based on wired fieldbus systems, wireless communication is the key to enable future industrial applications. However, the reliability of state-of-the-art wireless technologies is not sufficient for many industrial application scenarios. Thus, novel wireless approaches are being investigated at the moment, from which three promising physical layer (PHY) technologies are depicted for detailed evaluation in this paper: Ultra Wide Band (UWB), Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and Parallel Sequence Spread Spectrum (PSSS). In order to assess each system's performance, Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are derived from industrial application constraints. In this paper, industrial applications are therefore categorized by vital requirements such as spatial extent, number of nodes, cycle time, PER and user data length. The depicted technologies are evaluated regarding the KPIs error rate and coverage range in AWGN and industrial fading channel conditions.",

In addition, it also discusses how the acquisition of a human's state requires reliable networking. In this respect, an architecture for HITL management of networking configurations is presented. This architecture is implemented in an experimental scenario where a smartphone system attempts to positively impact mood by dynamically adapting privacy settings and networking interfaces to the user's emotions. In this scenario, good hand-off performance is crucial for improving Quality of Experience and reliability. Several experiments regarding emotional classification and mobile handoff are also presented and discussed.",

abstract="Twitter users post observations about their immediate environment as a part of the 500 million tweets posted everyday. As such, Twitter can become the source for invaluable information about objects, locations, and events, which can be analyzed and monitored in real time, not only to understand what is happening in the world, but also an event's exact location. However, Twitter data is noisy as sensory values, and information such as the location of a tweet may not be available, e.g., only 0.9 {\%} of tweets have GPS data. Due to the lack of accurate and fine-grained location information, existing Twitter event monitoring systems focus on city-level or coarser location identification, which cannot provide details for local events. In this paper, we propose SNAF (Sense and Focus), an event monitoring system for Twitter data that emphasizes local events. We increase the availability of the location information significantly by finding locations in tweet messages and users' past tweets. We apply data cleaning techniques in our system, and with extensive experiments, we show that our method can improve the accuracy of location inference by 5 {\%} to 20 {\%} across different error ranges. We also show that our prototype implementation of SNAF can identify critical local events in real time, in many cases earlier than news reports.",

abstract="The PRESENT block cipher was one of the first hardware-oriented proposals for implementation in extremely resource-constrained environments. Its design is based on 4-bit S-boxes and a 64-bit permutation, a far from optimal choice to achieve good performance in software. As a result, most software implementations require large lookup tables in order to meet efficiency goals. In this paper, we describe a new portable and efficient software implementation of PRESENT, fully protected against timing attacks. Our implementation uses a novel decomposition of the permutation layer, and bitsliced computation of the S-boxes using optimized Boolean formulas, not requiring lookup tables. The implementations are evaluated in embedded ARM CPUs ranging from microcontrollers to full-featured processors equipped with vector instructions. Timings for our software implementation show a significant performance improvement compared to the numbers from the FELICS benchmarking framework. In particular, encrypting 128 bits using CTR mode takes about 2100 cycles on a Cortex-M3, improving on the best Assembly implementation in FELICS by a factor of 8. Additionally, we present the fastest masked implementation of PRESENT for protection against timing and other side-channel attacks in the scenario we consider, improving on related work by 15{\%}. Hence, we conclude that PRESENT can be remarkably efficient in software if implemented with our techniques, and even compete with a software implementation of AES in terms of latency while offering a much smaller code footprint.",

abstract="Privacy by design and data protection by design focus mostly on product/service features, high-level design, security measures and organizational practices. However, low-level implementation details can also have a data protection impact that may need to be taken into account. This contribution discusses three emerging software development trends (immutability, schema-less databases and reactive programming) that are not yet well-known outside the software development sector. Each of these trends relies on ideas that may at first glance seem discordant with fundamental data protection principles (such as data quality, data minimization and data retention limitations). Even so, upon closer inspection, they also offer direct or indirect data protection benefits. Depending on the circumstances, the use of these trends may therefore be beneficial or even advisable from a data protection perspective. It nevertheless remains difficult to assess to which extent the new Data Protection Regulation will require these aspects to be integrated into data protection impact assessments and data protection by design/default compliance processes.",

abstract="In the biomedical signal analysis and transmission, procreation of radio frequency communication technology is recurrently perplexed by electromagnetic interference.

For demonstration, we transmitted electrocardiogram signal from Li-Fi transmitter to receiver and the performance has been analysed for various transmission distances. Further enhancement of this work has been proposed as an all-optical health monitoring system that is suitable for hospital environment. In hospitals, VLC is the efficient wireless data communication technology in health monitoring. VLC ensures secured, faster way of communication and use of unlicensed visible spectrum. This enhanced scheme uses biomedical sensors that detect specific biological, chemical, or physical changes that occur in a patient's body. Biological data are transmitted by an array of LEDs. Biomedical signal processing in both transmitter and receiver sections is performed by Arduino unit. The proposed research work focuses on developing a high-speed eco-friendly local area communication network with low-cost, off-the-shelf components for interconnecting electronic devices within hospital environment.",

abstract="Relay attacks are passive man-in-the-middle attacks that aim to extend the physical distance of devices involved in a transaction beyond their operating environment. In the field of smart cards, distance bounding protocols have been proposed in order to counter relay attacks. For smartphones, meanwhile, the natural ambient environment surrounding the devices has been proposed as a potential Proximity and Relay-Attack Detection (PRAD) mechanism. These proposals, however, are not compliant with industry-imposed constraints that stipulate maximum transaction completion times, e.g. 500 ms for EMV contactless transactions. We evaluated the effectiveness of 17 ambient sensors that are widely-available in modern smartphones as a PRAD method for time-restricted contactless transactions. In our work, both similarity- and machine learning-based analyses demonstrated limited effectiveness of natural ambient sensing as a PRAD mechanism under the operating requirements for proximity and transaction duration specified by EMV and ITSO. To address this, we propose the generation of an Artificial Ambient Environment (AAE) as a robust alternative for an effective PRAD. The use of infrared light as a potential PRAD mechanism is evaluated, and our results indicate a high success rate while remaining compliant with industry requirements.",

abstract="The recent trend towards interconnection of all networked objects lets smartphones consolidates its position as a global interface between user and Internet. Smartphones are getting closer to our daily life, and at the same time security threats to privacy of smartphone users continue to proliferate at a rapid rate. Android is the most popular target of attackers among other mobile platforms. Although the Android provides permission based security model, there are still many security weak points which may lead to invasion of smartphone user's privacy. In this paper, we propose multi-level security model for enhancing Android security. Our security framework assigns security level to application at installation and performs runtime monitoring. We describe an implementation of our security framework, and finally evaluate the security and performance.",

abstract="Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are viewed as a cheap solution for telemetry networks in rural areas. The main advantages of WMNs are that they allow an easy extension of existing networks to service a wider area by using multi-hop wireless communication and they provide an alternate route when a route becomes faulty. Smart Rural Areas is a new concept for the development of rural areas. It is hypothesized that the Internet of Things (IoT) can help develop rural areas by providing better services resulting in poverty reduction. The widely used carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) was originally designed for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consisting of single-hop transmissions. CSMA/CA experiences a rapid decrease in performance when applied to multi-hop distributed networks as an increase in collisions and contention for the medium is experienced. The IEEE 802.11e standard provides data differentiation services for data of different priority levels with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) being used in contention based networks. With EDCA, an unfairness problem exists where high priority data can starve lower priority data. To address these problems in low-cost rural smart networks we investigate the performance of six design schemes for wireless backbone networks by assigning different roles to edge and core routers. Simulations were carried out to obtain the results using OMNeT ++ and the INET framework. Simulation results show that hybrid network designs using distributed coordination function (DCF) and EDCA can improve QoS.",

In order to advance the state-of-the-art, there is a demand for models that correlate mobile sensor data, health parameters, and situational and/or social environment. We seek to improve current models by combining environmental monitoring, personal data collecting, and predictive analytics. For that, we introduce a middleware called Device Nimbus that provides the structures to integrate data from sensors in existing mobile computing technology. Moreover, it includes the algorithms for context inference and recommendation support. This development leads to innovative solutions in continuous health monitoring, based on recommendations contextualised in the situation and social environment.

Moreover, provision of personalized services depends on frequent contextual information analysis. In the case of elderly care, the use of assistive technology is expected to have a positive contribution to the diversity of required services that support aging well. Demographic trends show that the percentage of elderly population is increasing, while ageing entails several limitations, calling for assistance services adapted to the specific needs of each person. These needs can evolve along the ageing process, requiring an evolution of the care services.

abstract="Embedded devices with web interfaces are prevalent, but, due to memory and processing constraints, implementations typically make use of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in low-level, memory-unsafe languages. This creates the possibility of memory corruption attacks as well as traditional web attacks. We present Umbra, an application-layer firewall specifically designed for protecting web interfaces in embedded devices. By acting as a ``friendly man-in-the-middle,'' Umbra can protect against attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), information leaks, and authentication bypass vulnerabilities. We evaluate Umbra's security by analyzing recent vulnerabilities listed in the CVE database from several embedded vendors and find that it would have prevented half of the vulnerabilities. We also show that Umbra comfortably runs within the constraints of an embedded system while incurring minimal performance overhead.",

Clustering is adopted to degrade the problem scale in our approach and a moderate number of common nodes between clusters are kept during clustering. Inner cluster local coordinates are calculated and then mapped into global coordinates according the tree structure formed by clustering. The simulations on MATLAB are conducted and the results show that the proposed algorithm has better localization coverage and higher accuracy than the traditional MDS based algorithms.",

abstract="This paper proposes a prototype system that collaborates smartwatches with traditional video surveillance security. By combining concepts of user-centered design, ubiquitous wearable, psychophysiology and Internet of Things (IoTs), we present the upgraded video surveillance system where heart rate-based anomalies can automatically trigger the alarm. As a first prototype, the system was limited to library-like experimental setups and the anomaly was defined by arousal heart rate---unusually high heart beats. Using a smartwatch and a simple three-question questionnaire, we were able to collect referential arousal heart rate data from 25 healthy subjects together with their individual rating scores regarding three habit factors---smoking, drinking alcohol and eating fatty foods. According to our semi-quantitative user testings in a controlled library environment, the prototype was able to wirelessly connect and synchronize all devices, send the alarm, and perform real-time heart rate measurement as well as calculation. Based on confusion matrix evaluation, our anomaly detection gave promising results of 95 {\%} accuracy and 90 {\%} precision. However, major revision was required for the anomaly detection to cover unobserved factors, and there were serious usability problems regarding the smartwatch to be fixed.",

abstract="Recently, methods to big data are gaining a growing number of popularity, as we are entering the age of big data. As a result, novel methods keep emerging, among which stands random forest method. Random forest fuses multiple sub decision trees for classification and regression, with high accuracy and generalization. It, however, has unsatisfactory performance when facing data sets with more noise and redundant features. This phenomenon is mainly caused by inaccuracy from some sub decision trees, and fusing all of them directly cannot decrease their negative effect. Therefore, we proposed advanced random forest to assign less probability to those negative sub decision trees, meaning they are less likely to be chosen at fusion process. Thus, the capability of prediction is improved. Dropout and roulette method we used in the process ensures a good generalization capability, and maintains a higher accuracy simultaneously. We sample the original data set following the method of K-fold division which will increase the differences between sub decision trees, making the prediction more credible. Finally, our proposed method is validated on several data sets. Experimental results show that compared to traditional random forest method, our method has higher classification accuracy on data sets with noise and data sets with more redundant features.",

abstract="The resonant converter control is usually implemented by electronic circuits that regulate the parameters of the necessarily produced energy pulses of circulating in the resonant circuit. In the same time the power circuit is characterized by fixed (or uncontrollably varying) parameters. In this article a research is described that shows a long time ago forgotten techniques: the magnetic amplifier that controls the power circuit parameters and as a result, changes the resonant frequency depending on the needs of control. The inductance that is made to vary its value in a controllable, continuous and linear mode would be a perfect (non-dissipative) regulator for the power converter. This can be achieved through a DC magnetization applied as a control command to the magnetic core. By varying this magnetization current and hence the magnetic parameters of the core, the inductance L is possible to be adjusted to a desired value. This operation is similar to the principle of the (long ago) well known ``magnetic amplifier'' or the ``saturable core reactor'' as it is often called. The magnetic amplifier usually has an AC source in series with the load and with its primary while in the secondary the DC control signal is applied. The application of a regulated inductance device in the Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) will guarantee a simple way to adjust the frequency of the transmitter and/or the receiver to achieve the required impedance adaptation and efficient energy transfer.",

abstract="In today's ubiquitous environments, more and more companies use cloud computing services to achieve their everyday operations and processes. However, the development of these services is a tedious and time consuming task. Moreover, existing solutions rarely take into account the personalization and the adaptation of services to the context of their use. In this paper, we propose an architecture for context-aware service composition in cloud environments to address the challenges mentioned above. The architecture takes advantage of service composition as a way to create new composite services from a set of atomic or composite ones, causing the reduction of development efforts and time to market, and also, the introduction of context-awareness to manage the dynamics of ubiquitous environments.",

Nowadays, we live in a fast-paced era that leaded by information, the heavy and boring instructions inevitably become a kind of burden before using appliances. In addition, it is a painful sorrow among the children, the old or the special people. However, the rise of 3D demo animation solves the problems very well. It exhibits the products from all aspects by the form of animation. Besides, in order to make users have more direct experiences, some film design companies put the interaction technology into it. It is direct interaction that brings users a combined feel of novelty, favor and trust, at the same time, it reduces the distance between products and users. So, products made by animation as well as interaction design should be explained from users' view when design the 3D demo animation of smart home, which can make demo animation be more functional and interesting through some simple actions such as click, lither to let users know and use the appliance cheerfully. The interaction design of the 3D demo animation not only pay attention to the different gender region different requirements of age groups, but also study the different needs of special populations. It notices their needs on the basis of general design. This article lists some excellent 3D animation works at home and abroad, which display the products and the unique cultural image of the corporate by the way of interaction. This passage researches the physiological and psychological characteristics of the users when they touch the new product, then, it analyzes the design principle of the 3D demo animation as well as the users' experiences.

However, regarding elderly care, services are typically isolated, and mostly provided by a single provider. Moreover, there is a need to personalize services in respect of the individuality of each senior and making these services evolve according to the lifestyle and necessities of the person. In this context, the concept of Elderly Care Ecosystem (ECE) emerges as a computer-based collaborative environment that promotes the integration of distinct services and providers. ECEs are complex systems that demand a clear description of their requirements, especially of those related to personalization of services. In this paper, we describe a set of core requirements and challenges for designing personalized services in an elderly care ecosystem. In particular, our contributions are: the identification of the main stakeholders of an ECE, the requirements to build a persona profile in ECE, and a reference requirements model based on i* for service personalization in ECE.",

Humans work in partnership (directly or indirectly) or closely related with agents that are able to act autonomously and intelligently. Specifically, humans and agents have the ability to establish a series of relationships/collaborative interactions with each other, forming what might be called human-agent teams to meet their individual or collective goals within an organisation or social structure. Systems in which people and agents operate on a large scale offer an enormous potential but also require the consideration of additional issues.

The value of Fleiss' Kappa was 0.782, over the excellent criterion of 0.75, which means the inter-rater reliability of persuasive design guideline was reliable. We collected 697 car apps from Apple iTunes Store and Google Play and examined which design principles were implemented by these car apps. The result shows that nine persuasive design principles are found, such as reduction, trustworthiness, real-world feel, self-monitoring, personalization, reminder, suggestion, expertise, and verifiability. The results from this study would suggest some implications for car app developers and automakers to develop better car apps in the future.",

abstract="The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is the recording of the electrical activity of the human heart. The compression of the ECG signal is highly beneficial for the purpose of wireless transmission as well as storage. A new algorithm for ECG signal compression is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is based on the observation that the ECG signal in the steady state is very stable with highly correlated successive pulses. Thus, the algorithm performs differential encoding between each new pulse and a stored reference pulse. This idea is inspired by the video compression techniques where the inter-frame changes are very limited. Therefore, high signal compression ratio can be obtained. The performance of the introduced technique is evaluated and compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. The performance is characterized by the compression ratio (CR) and the percentage of root mean square difference (PRD). The algorithm achieved a CR of 105 with PRD below 1.3{\%}. Moreover, the comparison with other existing ECG compression methods demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm.",

abstract="The ``Royal Road'' objective function was proposed by J. H. Holland in 1993 as a very hard benchmark problem for evolutionary algorithms. Generally, it belongs to the class of combinatorial optimization problems. In our work, we solve the problem in a distributed way by assigning each decision variable to an autonomous agent. The resulting multi-agent system ``COHDA'' forms a self-organizing complex system, where the global solution emerges from local interactions. By applying the XOR instance generator introduced by S. Yang in 2003, we are able to pertubate the system during runtime by modifying the objective function. This allows us to examine the robustness of COHDA against dynamic objectives. Here, we focus on the influence of runtime memory, which comprises the beliefs of each agent, on the adaptivity capabilities of the agents after an occured pertubation. We show that the final fitness values produced by the system do not suffer from a dynamic objective function, and are not influenced by the availability of an agents' runtime memory. The time needed by the system to adapt to such a pertubation, however, significantly increases if the agents' beliefs are being distorted. We conclude that, in terms of solution quality, COHDA is very robust against dynamic objective functions. With respect to adaptation speed, the heuristic benefits from the availability of runtime memory.",

abstract="In recent years Multi-Agent Systems have proven to be a useful paradigm for areas where inconsistency and uncertainty are the norm. Network security environments suffer from these problems and could benefit from a Multi-Agent model for dynamic forensic investigations. Building upon previous solutions that lack the necessary levels of scalability and autonomy, we present a decentralised model for collecting and analysing network security data to attain higher levels of accuracy and efficiency. The main contributions of the paper are: (i) a Multi-Agent model for the dynamic organisation of agents participating in forensic investigations; (ii) an agent architecture endowed with mechanisms for collecting and analysing network data; (iii) a protocol for allowing agents to coordinate and make collective decisions on the maliciousness of suspicious activity; and (iv) a simulator tool to test the proposed decentralised model, agents and communication protocol under a wide range of circumstances and scenarios.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks are formed of thousands of nodes that need to be deployed to maintain good sensing coverage area. Deployment of a wireless sensor network in a hostile or hazardous environment is a challenging problem. To address this problem, a bundle of sensors to be deployed is initially placed in a definite region within the area of the network. Then the sensor nodes are diffused cooperatively and gradually to increase coverage area. This paper proposes a self-deployment heuristic approach for WSN based on the Four Quadrants Deployment Model (FQDM). It studies the effect of applying a realistic energy model to FQDM, and proposes an extended version of FQDM to enhance the coverage at border areas. The proposed approach relocates the sensors in a way that maximizes the coverage while minimizing energy consumption. Results show that it gives a good coverage for definite region while conserving energy of sensors.",

Indeed, in this research work, we propose a platform that addresses the problem of energy management of different electric devices in a smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT) building and particularly high performance computing (HPC) data centers. This platform integrates the mobile technology as a means to facilitate the maintenance operations usually executed by the mobile workforce agents on smart building electric devices. Another important issue integrated in this proposed platform deals with the monitoring of a life safety plan in case of an emergency scenario due, for instance, to fire detection. The emergency rescue monitoring is eased by the use of mobile devices such as the tablets, usually handled by people in a smart ICT building.",

This demand will be exasperated in the future as more and more people are shying away to go to medical school because of large costs involved. The response time of the medical professional depends on the delays in receiving this information and the delay involved in processing the data before communicating to the right professional. This paper addresses the advantages of an intelligent processing of sensor data at the patient level using body area network. The proposed technique investigate the impact of communication technologies ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.6 on End to End (Patient to medical facility) delay, energy consumption along with the reduction of response times after the data is received at the medical facility. In the simulation, the traffic sent of sensor data rate with normal range threshold always keep better performance in the blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, SPO2 sensor and temperature sensor.

The mobile application is devoted to providing medical staff with the geolocation of victims as well as with an assistant indicating the best route to follow in order to take care of them based on the severity of their conditions and based on a triage method. Resolution of the routes is solved based on a classical problem, a Travelling Salesman Problem, using a k-partition algorithm to divide the huge number of victims in different clusters. Thus, each doctor has a specific area to assist victims. Besides, doctors can use a functionality of the application to contact their peers through a chat when additional help is needed.

The method used is a field study (observation) by interviewing and SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) approaching. The pattern of SDLC approaching consists of several stages: planning, data analysis, designing data base by using the language of UML (Unified Modeling Language), and coding. The final stage is the implementation of a test. The final stage of this research is a prototype of the web-based health service information system, so that it will help the administrative staff when processing the health service in terms of preparing referral letters and even up to a recapitulation.",

This research includes an EU funded 3 year project HoliDes---Holistic Human Factors and System Design of Adaptive Cooperative Human Machine Systems [1]. HSI has been incorporated in the project lifecycle via US Military (DoD-Instruction 5000.2) [2] with the introduction of a Human System Integration Plan, which is a key requirement for the validation and verification of any new system or any modification to any existing US military system. Airbus DS has used HSI in several innovative approaches, these include, the dramatic reduction in the manpower and costs of deployment and logistic support for large scale military operations, the integration with our Architectural Framework to provide a system architecture that is compliant with the US and UK Lines of development---Training, Equipment, Personnel (HR), Organisation, Information, Logistics, Concepts and Doctrine and Infrastructure and the introduction of ILS and Training into our MBSE approach. Airbus DS recognises the need to integrate HSI into its system engineering lifecycle as in the past the inclusion of human interaction has generally been missed and as most systems interact with people, HSI provides Airbus DS with complete systems integration process. Our Human System Integration (HSI) work at Airbus DS is evolving from the initial Human View Architectural Framework research [4] and then the nine HSI domains---Manpower, Personnel, Training, Human Factors Engineering, Environment, Occupational Health, Safety, Survivability and Habitability [5].",

abstract="ZigBee network routing protocols combine Cluster-Tree routing and AODV routing (Cluster-Tree + AODVjr), its obvious drawback is that the control overhead is too high and higher end-to-end delay. Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) is a hybrid routing protocol and suitable for the most of AD HOC network. The ZRP routing protocol applied in ZigBee network, whether it can get a better performance? This paper applies the ZRP routing protocol in ZigBee network and makes a comparison with the Cluster-Tree + AODVjr routing protocol which is applied in the same network. Finally, we make a simulation of Cluster-Tree + AODVjr and ZRP protocols under QualNet simulating platform, and compare the routing protocols from the packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and control overhead.",

Simulations indicated that hiding capacity is larger than existing techniques while the perceived quality is good. Moreover, the method is tolerant of the attacks such as inversion, translation, truncation, and Gaussian noise-addition attacks, which is rare in conventional ECG steganographic schemes. Since the privacy (or medical message) of the patients can be fast and effective embedded in ECG host by the proposed method, it is feasible for our method being employed in real-time applications.",

The construction of Mobile Health Communities (MHC) supported by Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) is essential for mobile healthcare emergency scenarios. In a previous work, we have introduced the COLLEGA middleware, which integrates modules for supporting mobile health scenarios and the formation of MHCs through MCS. In this paper, we extend the COLLEGA middleware to address the need in real time scenarios to handle data arriving continuously in streams from MHC's members. In particular, this paper describes the novel COLLEGA support for managing the real-time formation of MHCs.

abstract="This paper describes the application of machine learning algorithms in detecting the liver lesion from abdominal CT images. Liver lesions are usually detected by different imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (USG), or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These lesions can be of benign or malignant in nature, both of which present similar appearance in the images. The segregation of the liver lesions into benign or malignant has been done with painful invasive techniques by the medical practitioners which create considerable difficulty to the patients. In this work the malignant liver lesion namely the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is differentially identified from normal liver tissue with the help of supervised classification algorithms. The grainy nature of liver parenchyma is the prime factor in making the texture features for discriminating it from other tissues. Different textures features have been extracted from the Region of Interest (ROI) identified by an expert radiologist and are applied as an input to the classifiers for training and testing. The support vector machine (SVM) and na{\"i}ve Bayes' classifier are supervised learning techniques. Thus our proposed Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system can be easily operated by a medical practitioner in differentially detecting the HCC tissue from normal liver tissue with best classification accuracy which is more than 90{\%}. Hence the painful invasive methods can be avoided to a great extent. The performance evaluation is done by calculating the accuracy, confusion matrix, sensitivity, and specificity. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) also have been plotted.",

abstract="A big challenge for Europe is the demographic shift towards an aging population. Resources in the health care sector are limited, so it is important that the seniors of tomorrow will be able to stay healthy and manage themselves as long as possible, preferably also with a good quality of life. Physical activity is very important both for mobility and for the general well-being, but it can be hard to find motivation to exercise alone at home. Also in rehabilitation there is a need for a more engaging approach than a sheet of paper describing exercises that should be performed. In the GameUp project we developed fun and motivational exergames particularly targeting elderly in a user centred approach. Physiotherapists ensured that the movements and exercises were good for flexibility, leg strength and balance. In addition to seven Kinect games, a walking app and a professional portal were developed. The Kinect games can be played in several levels, and those who are at risk of falling are able to play while seated. The professional portal ensures that the results of the project also can be used as a tool in rehabilitation. Test results from 20 elderly aged 65-95 as well as clinical trials of adherence to the exercises are encouraging, and the international and multidisciplinary team behind the project is now looking for ways to commercialize the project outcomes.",

abstract="This paper presents an accurate indoor localisation approach to provide context aware support for Activities of Daily Living. This paper explores the use of contemporary wearable technology (Google Glass) to facilitate a unique first-person view of the occupants environment. Machine vision techniques are then employed to determine an occupant's location via environmental object detection within their field of view. Specifically, the video footage is streamed to a server where object recognition is performed using the Oriented Features from Accelerated Segment Test and Rotated Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features algorithm with a K-Nearest Neighbour matcher to match the saved keypoints of the objects to the scene. To validate the approach, an experimental set-up consisting of three ADL routines, each containing at least ten activities, ranging from drinking water to making a meal were considered. Ground truth was obtained from manually annotated video data and the approach was subsequently benchmarked against a common method of indoor localisation that employs dense sensor placement. The paper presents the results from these experiments, which highlight the feasibility of using off-the-shelf machine vision algorithms to determine indoor location based on data input from wearable video-based sensor technology. The results show a recall, precision, and F-measure of 0.82, 0.96, and 0.88 respectively. This method provides additional secondary benefits such as first person tracking within the environment and lack of required sensor interaction to determine occupant location.",

abstract="Transport risks in supply chains have increasingly lead to significant capital losses. Insurance claims against such losses have grown accordingly, while simultaneous advances in technology lead to continuously larger volumes of data recorded. Traditional risk evaluation methods in insurance struggle to account for rising supply chain complexity which is reflected by growing amount and dimensionality of supply chain data. Therefore decision-makers in the transport insurance industry need new ways of appropriate knowledge representation to support transport insurance providers with daily tasks such as premium tariffing. This paper presents a method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) for the identification of groups of similar claims as a first step towards the improvement of supply chain risk evaluation and forecasting. We show the application potential of transforming and visualising transport damage claims data as the basis for developing decision support systems (DSS) to support transport insurance providers in tasks such as premium tariffing as well as transport and supply chain managers in risk mitigation and prevention activities.",

More specifically speaking, the health of a human body may be affected, and chances of accident may arise due to the lowering of ones' alertness as a result of the reduction of activity in cerebral cortex. In this study, by means of a portable electroencephalograph machine and brain-computer interface, the brainwave of bus drivers were measured for their fatigue quality. The results indicated that through the empirical formula proposed, we were able to measure people's fatigue state with a result comparable to sophisticated medical instrument.",

abstract="The paper describes a new way of activity monitoring of small rodents by the use of Raspberry PI and RFID. The created system deals with complex monitoring, record and acquisition of new entries from spatial activity. Raspberry PI is a full-valued micro-PC with an operating system based on Linux which communicates and controls RFID reader working at the frequency of 125 and 134 kHz. It is needed to read LF RFID chips. Monitoring station preserves transmitter scanning by a programme created in Java and RFID chip reader and sending entries into relational database. The created database is on the central Raspberry PI to which other Raspberry PI monitoring stations have access through WiFi net or LAN net. It is possible to access the central PC by a remote management. The created system is variable, compact and offers wide possibilities of spread, and the last but not least, the system is a cheap alternative of the already existing systems.",

An artificial ventilation system is also proposed to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide concentration by activating fans. In this paper, four levels of carbon monoxide concentration were identified ranging from 20 to 449 parts per million (ppm) which is the normal level. Depending on the level of CO recorded by the sensor, a certain number of fans will be activated. The project is based on the work in [1] where a CO sensor sends data to the web application which then stores it in a database. The user can access the application via any device with access to the internet to be aware in real time of the data recorded by the sensor. The information recorded by the sensor can be detailed through charts and reports; this data includes the date and time of the last dangerous event, the number of registered users, the day of execution of the query and the time when the sensor is connected to the app.",

abstract="As a special kind of application of wireless sensor networks, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have broad perspectives especially in clinical caring and medical monitoring. Big data acquired from BSNs usually contain sensitive information, which are compulsory to be appropriately protected. However, previous methods overlooked the privacy protection issue, leading to privacy violation. In this paper, a differential privacy protection scheme for big data in body sensor network is proposed. We introduce the concept of dynamic noise thresholds which makes our scheme more suitable for processing big data. It can ensure privacy during the whole life cycle of the data, which makes privacy protection for big data in BSNs promising. Extensive experiments are conducted to outline the merits of our scheme. Experimental results reveal that our scheme has higher level of privacy protection. Even in the case where the attacker has full background knowledge, it still provides sufficient ambiguity, which ensures being unable to match people based on the ECG data characteristic so as to preserve the privacy.",

abstract="Among the representation learning, the low-rank representation (LRR) is one of the hot research topics in many fields, especially in image processing and pattern recognition. Although LRR can capture the global structure, the ability of local structure preservation is limited because LRR lacks dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-focus image fusion method based on dictionary learning and LRR to get a better performance in both global and local structure. Firstly, the source images are divided into several patches by sliding window technique. Then, the patches are classified according to the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features. And the sub-dictionaries of each class are learned by K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm. Secondly, a global dictionary is constructed by combining these sub-dictionaries. Then, we use the global dictionary in LRR to obtain the LRR coefficients vector for each patch. Finally, the                                                                           {\$}{\$}l{\_}1-norm{\$}{\$}                                                                                                              l                          1                                                -                        n                        o                        r                        m                                                                             and choose-max fuse strategy for each coefficients vector is adopted to reconstruct fused image from the fused LRR coefficients and the global dictionary.

abstract="Recent few years has seen a tremendous advancement in wireless communication technology. This advancement has opened a door for researchers to work in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for use in a broad array of real-life applications. An enormous number of remotely deployed autonomous sensors gather data from their vicinity and communicate it to the base station after processing. The sensors communicate through some wireless strategies governed by routing protocols, which has a great impact on the performance of sensor networks. With this insight, we extensively surveyed routing protocols for WSNs. The network structure leads to the broad classification of WSNs' protocols in three foremost classes: flat, hierarchical, and location based routing. Cluster-based routing provides certain advantages over others like scalability, increased network lifetime and efficient data aggregation. In this work, we study and provide a detailed survey of famous hierarchical routing protocols, a taxonomy of hierarchical routing protocols along with the design challenges and also present a comparative analysis based on their traits and limitations.",

abstract="The CWQ Calculus (a Calculus for Wireless sensor networks from Quality perspective) was recently proposed for modeling and reasoning about Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It has the flexibility that not all input data in a binder need to be received in order for the process to continue. Meanwhile, it has the unique and important characteristic that, in order for the decision of a system of a WSN to be of high trustworthiness, the decision is expected to be made by considering all data from all network nodes in the WSN. Consequently, decisions of a system may have different trustworthiness depending on which input data have actually been received. In this paper, we propose a data-driven probabilistic trust analysis of the CWQ Calculus for WSNs. We assume that data received from a channel have trust values that follow a probability distribution; that is, the trust value of a data represents the trust of the decision of a system made solely based on that data. Thus, we decouple the probability of receiving input data from the probability of data trustworthiness. The overall trustworthiness of the decision of a system is determined by performing a relational analysis to combine these probability distributions.",

This paper analyzes the possibility of wireless communication in 433 MHz and its lower sensitivity to water containing environments by means of a case study in an apple storage warehouse. The experiment shows near conformity to a previously implemented theoretical model of signal attenuation, the only error being due to ca. 10 {\%} more water in apples compared to bananas.

abstract="Wireless Sensor Network in which nodes are mobile can be defined as MWSN (Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks). MWSNs are a budding field of research in contrast to their well-established ancestor. It consists of a variety of sensing elements deployed indiscriminately and at enormous scale. This can build a huge variety of redundant sensory information. Transmission of such redundant data saturates network resources and it additionally consumes nodes energy. Data aggregation is the process of reducing the amount of packets to be sent to sink to increase the life time of MWSN. Path and location of the nodes are changing frequently in mobile WSN. So Swarm intelligence (group behaviour) is needed for the communication as well as on data collection, Query publication and intrusion detection. To operate MWSNs in a secure way, intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network. Intrusion can also occur in multiple layers of MWSN so continuous investigation of aggregated data to be needed. Proposed work is for SIDI (Swarm Intelligence based Data aggregation for Intruder detection) raising the energy efficiency of a network. Simulation results indicate that this operation practically will increase the network lifetime.",
