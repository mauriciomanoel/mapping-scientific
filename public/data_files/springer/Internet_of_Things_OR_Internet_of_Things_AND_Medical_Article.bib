abstract="As a kind of medical service around people, community health care is closely related to peoples lives, and thus it has also been placed higher requirements. In the face of growing community medical needs, the construction and development of community medical Internet of things is imminent. Subsequently, massive multi-type of medical data which contain all kinds of user identity data, various types of vital signs data and other sensitive information are generated. Such a large scale of data in the transmission, storage and access process is facing the risk of data leakage. To effectively protect the privacy information of patients, an infrastructure framework for privacy protection of community medical Internet of things is proposed. It includes transmission protection based on multi-path asymmetric encryption fragment transmission mechanism, storage protection using distributed symmetric encryption cloud storage scheme and access control with identity authentication and dynamic access authorization. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, it is proved that the community medical data can be effectively protected.",

In this paper, we expose each object capabilities as a web service and propose a resource-oriented service publishing method for devices in IoT. With the proposed ontology-based resource description model, various objects are abstracted as basic resources with multidimensional attributes. The basic resources are further combined into more complex resources to support practical business functions. All the resources will be published by the representational state transfer interface.

abstract="Recently, research on cloud-integrated Internet of Things where an Internet of Things (IoT) is converged with a cloud environment has been actively pursued. An IoT operates through interaction among many composition elements, such as actuators and sensors. At present, IoTs are used in diverse areas (for example, traffic control and safety, energy savings, process control, communications systems, distributed robots, and other important applications). In daily life, IoTs should provide services of high reliability corresponding with various physical elements. In order to guarantee highly reliable IoT services, optimized modeling, simulation, and resource management technologies integrating physical elements and computing elements are required. For such reasons, many systems are being developed where autonomic computing technologies are applied that sense any internal errors or external environmental changes occurring during system operation and where systems adapt or evolve themselves. In an IoT environment composed of large-scale nodes, autonomic computing requires a high processing amount and efficient storage processing of computing in order to process sensing data efficiently. In addition, due to the heterogeneous composition of IoT environments, separate middleware is required to share collected information. Accordingly, this paper proposed an efficient resource management scheme (ERMS) that efficiently manages IoT resources using cloud infrastructure satisfying the high availability, expansion, and high processing amount requirements. ERMS provides a XML-based standard sensing data storage scheme in order to store and process heterogeneous IoT sensing data in the cloud infrastructure. In addition, ERMS provides classification techniques to efficiently store and process distributed IoT data.",

abstract="Managing privacy in the IoT presents a significant challenge. We make the case that information obtained by auditing the flows of data can assist in demonstrating that the systems handling personal data satisfy regulatory and user requirements. Thus, components handling personal data should be audited to demonstrate that their actions comply with all such policies and requirements. A valuable side-effect of this approach is that such an auditing process will highlight areas where technical enforcement has been incompletely or incorrectly specified. There is a clear role for technical assistance in aligning privacy policy enforcement mechanisms with data protection regulations. The first step necessary in producing technology to accomplish this alignment is to gather evidence of data flows. We describe our work producing, representing and querying audit data and discuss outstanding challenges.",

abstract="In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, Secured information transfer is necessitated between mobile and internet based services in IoT environments. As IoT environment connected to heterogeneous network, they become vulnerable to attacks and hence it is required for secured mechanism for data transfer. Moreover, when secured cryptographic algorithms are employed in mobile phones, battery consumption plays a major role. The IoT environment associated with proposed algorithm can be used to interlink humans and enable the use of a communication channel to bring forth inter machine interaction. The encryption procedures used here makes sure that the major concerns of authentication uniqueness, confidentiality and privacy of the users are maintained. This implies that the users and the service providers can implement the system security measures that have been proposed. Research is still being conducted to improve the architecture and implementation strategies in a real time environment. In order to solve those issues, this paper proposes a novel scalar point-multiplication which gives low energy consumed snippet based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that provides same level of security and also keeps low energy consumption by speeding up the computation time. The performance evaluation with the key size of 14 and 16 bits reveals that the proposed algorithm can be fast and saves the battery life than the other conventional ECC algorithms.",

High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the state-of-the-art video coding technology that can provide powerful video compression performance under limited bandwidth conditions for transmission or storage. Although HEVC adopted newly advanced video coding tools to achieve a bitrate reduction of 50{\%} with similar video quality compared to the previous method, H.264/AVC, these cause heavy computational encoding complexity resulting from inter prediction process of HEVC encoder. In this paper, we propose a complexity scalable SKIP/MERGE encoding algorithm to design a low complexity inter prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much faster than those of HEVC test model (47.42{\%}) and previous method (13.95{\%}) in terms of total encoding time, on average.",

abstract="IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between ``everything'', IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytic tools are able to extract ``sense'' from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.",

abstract="Pavement image segmentation needs to deal with noise spots and has real time requirement. The original FCM method only considers the pixel's gray value and doesn't fully utilize the spatial information of the image. A new fast FCM algorithm is proposed, and it has noise immunity. By comparing with other FCM algorithms, it achieves better segmentation results through less iteration times and more rapid runtime. It is an effective and noise-resistant algorithm for pavement image segmentation from video multimedia in IOT (internet of things) platform.",

Traditional multi-sensor data fusion can deal with the same type of data effectively. However, as new characteristics emerge in the IoT, interoperable service-oriented technologies are required to share real-world data among heterogeneous devices to integrate and fuse the multi-source heterogeneous IoT data. To address these issues, an architecture that can provide guidance for the development of IoT information fusion is required. We compare features of IoT data and information with an existing wireless sensor network and the Internet, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comparison of this kind. Then, we design a framework for multi-source heterogeneous information fusion in the IoT and use an experimental simulation platform to build an environmental monitoring system to assess the framework.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) enables producers of context data like sensors to interact with remote consumers of context data like smart pervasive applications in an entirely decoupled way. However, two important issues are faced by context data distribution, namely providing context information with a sufficient level of quality---i.e. quality of context (QoC)---while preserving the privacy of context owners. This article presents the solutions provided by the INCOME middleware framework for addressing these two potentially contradictory issues while hiding the complexity of context data distribution in heterogeneous and large-scale environments. Context producers and consumers not only express their needs in context contracts but also the guarantees they are ready to fulfil. These contracts are then translated into advertisement and subscription filters to determine how to distribute context data. Our experiments on a first open source prototype show that QoC-based filtering and privacy protection using attributed-based access control can be performed at a reasonable cost.",

A landslide occurred in the filling body of the eastern part of the Panzhihua airport on October 3, 2009 (hereafter called the 10.3 landslide). We conducted field survey on the landslide and adopted emergency monitoring and warning models based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate the losses from the disaster and to prevent a secondary disaster from occurring. The results showed that four major features of the airport site had contributed to the landslide, i.e, high altitude, huge amount of filling rocks, deep backfilling and great difficulty of backfilling. The deformation process of the landslide had six stages and the unstable geological structure of high fillings and an earthquake were the main causes of the landslide. We adopted relative displacement sensing technology and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology to achieve remote, real-time and unattended monitoring of ground cracks in the landslide. The monitoring system, including five extensometers with measuring ranges of 200, 450 and 700 mm, was continuously working for 17 months and released 7 warning signals with an average warning time of about 26 hours. At 10 am on 6 December 2009, the system issued a warning and on-site workers were evacuated and equipment protected immediately.

Frailty of old age, susceptibility to diseases, and impairments are inevitable issues that these senior adults need to deal with in daily life.

Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring.

The major problems facing by blind people fall in the category of navigating through indoor and outdoor environments consisting of various obstacles and recognition of person in front of them. Identification of objects or person only with perceptive and audio information is difficult. An intelligent, portable, less expensive, self-contained navigation and face recognition system is highly demanded for blind people. This helps blind people to navigate with the help of a Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) and a system equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Face recognition can be done using neural learning techniques with feature extraction and training modules. The images of friends, relatives are stored in the database of user Smartphone. Whenever a person comes in front of the blind user, the application with the help of neural network gives the voice aid to the user. Thus this system can replace the regular imprecise use of guide dogs as well as white sticks to help the navigation and face recognition process for people with impaired vision.In this paper, we have proposed a novel image recognition and navigation system which provides precise and quick messages in the form of audio to visually challenged people so that they can navigate easily.

These technologies are key technology of various ICT convergence services, and it will create a value-added business and market. Although it is in its infancy, there is no doubt that it will be a game changer. However, cloud computing technology and IoT technology have some limitations especially in openness and standardization because they have been independently evolved. This is why they expose some weak-points, which are difficult to expand to various services, and it also has some problems to interwork other devices or services. In the safe network case, current safe network service has a restriction because it is based on closed networks. In addition, the key technology in the safe networking has an independent scheme or architecture. Due to the fact that we need new architecture to integrate entire networks, there are no certain alternatives so far. It is because most of related works are focused on the providing to just the safety in the networks. To solve these problems, we propose a safe data transmission architecture for the IoT ecosystems. The proposed architecture is a kind of software defined network base cloud, and it can provide the safe data transmission with QoS/QoE. Basically, the proposed architecture has three states, install, start and working, and four phase, negotiation, initialization, configuration and execution. In the install state, the devices set some parameters such as a synchronization time between node in cloud and IoT device. Based on the install state, data transmission will be started in the start state. In the start state, the nodes start data transmission by the set parameters in the install state. And then, the nodes keep the working state. However, it can be changed whenever user's request to upgrade the transmission security. The proposed architecture has some enhanced synchronization algorithms to provide a safe data transmission and to guarantee a QoS/QoE. Based on the architecture, we verified that the proposed architecture outperforms than legacy architectures in various aspects, and we are shown these simulation results by using OPNET.",

In this paper, we present a novel scalable grouping proof protocol. Since scalability is a challenge in grouping proof protocol, to solve the scalability problem in the proposed protocol, the reader broadcasts the messages and the tags respond to it independently. In terms of the performance, we use a 64-bit lightweight Pseudo-Random Number Generator (64-PRNG) function, which meets the needs of low-power and low-cost systems. In addition, the security analysis results prove that the proposed protocol is resistant against RFID threats and provides an acceptable security level and low computation cost.",

IoT is an emerging concept, based on the convergence of legacy technologies, like RFID, WSN and smart objects, for connecting billions of ``things''. Such a massive connectivity generates a huge data for analysis, processing, mining and storage. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of IoT is also raising significant technical and application challenges. Many countries are innovating and adapting IoT for the development of the country's economy. Korea, being a digitally advanced country, is already ranked second in ``suitability of preparedness for IoT opportunities''. In this paper, we first mention the vision, capabilities and status of IoT. Next, we discuss the architectural requirements and popular global IoT projects. Subsequently, we review the history, research plans and applications of Korean IoT. Finally, our work concludes with a list of major open issues and challenges faced by the Korean IoT industry with pointers to possible solutions.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) can manage a large number of smart wireless devices and form a networking infrastructure connected to the Internet. Traditional batteries in IoT produce environmental concerns and have limited operational life. Harvesting and converting ambient environmental energy is an effective and important approach for sustainable green power used in wireless and portable devices in IoT. This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art development of different energy harvesting sources including mechanical, light/solar, wind, sound, RF, biomechanical and pyroelectric energy. Power density generated from ambient source ranges widely from 0.001 $\mu$W/cm2 (RF WiFi) to 100 mW/cm2 (outdoor solar). Depends on application areas and working principles, typical power consumptions of IoT sensor nodes are in the order of mW (1--750 mW) in active mode and $\mu$W (0--60 $\mu$W) in sleep mode (Mathna et al. in Talanta 75:613--623, 2008; Magno et al. in IEEE Trans Ind Electron 61:1871--1881, 2014; Baranov et al. in Sens Actuators A 233:279--289, 2015; Somov et al. in Procedia Eng 87:520--523, 2014; Spirjakin et al. in Sens Actuators A 247:247--253, 2016; Samson et al. in Sens Actuators A 172:240--244, 2011). Therefore, efficient energy storage and management strategies are important for IoT development. These parts are discussed in order to provide the sustainable power. MEMS based energy harvesting devices may be widely employed in various areas, such as military monitoring, remote weather station, bluetooth headsets, and environment detection. This review focuses on the low power and self powered IoT applications: sensors, wearables, and RF-MEMS. With the advance of nanofabrication techniques, IoT devices will become smaller and enter into the era of Internet of Nano-Things.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging global infrastructure that employs wireless sensors to collect, store, and exchange data. Increasingly, applications for marketing and advertising have been articulated as a means to enhance the consumer shopping experience, in addition to improving efficiency. However, privacy advocates have challenged the mass aggregation of personally-identifiable information in databases and geotracking, the use of location-based services to identify one's precise location over time. This paper employs the framework of contextual integrity related to privacy developed by Nissenbaum (Privacy in context: technology, policy, and the integrity of social life. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2010) as a tool to understand citizen response to implementation IoT-related technology in the supermarket. The purpose of the study was to identify and understand specific changes in information practices brought about by the IoT that may be perceived as privacy violations. Citizens were interviewed, read a scenario of near-term IoT implementation, and were asked to reflect on changes in the key actors involved, information attributes, and principles of transmission. Areas where new practices may occur with the IoT were then highlighted as potential problems (privacy violations). Issues identified included the mining of medical data, invasive targeted advertising, and loss of autonomy through marketing profiles or personal affect monitoring. While there were numerous aspects deemed desirable by the participants, some developments appeared to tip the balance between consumer benefit and corporate gain. This surveillance power creates an imbalance between the consumer and the corporation that may also impact individual autonomy. The ethical dimensions of this problem are discussed.",

In this paper, a comprehensive IoT-based framework is presented for analyzing national integrity of defence personnel with consideration to his/her daily activities. As reported by investigating agencies of many countries, routinely engagements of defence personnel are one of the premier reasons for vulnerability to national defence through intentional and unintentional information outflow of defence secrets. The work presented in this research is focused on monitoring various activities of defence personnel to determine his/her integral behavior in daily life. Specifically, Integrity Index Value is defined for every defence personnel based on different social engagements, and activities for detecting the vulnerability to national security. In addition to this, a probabilistic decision tree based automated decision making is presented to aid defence officials in analyzing various activities of a defence personnel for his/her integrity assessment. In order to validate the proposed framework, three challenging data sets have been considered for experimental evaluation.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next evolutionary paradigm of networking technologies that interconnects almost all the smart objects and intelligent sensors related to human activities, machineries, and environment. IoT technologies and Internet Protocol connectivity enable wide ranges of network devices to communicate irrespective of their resource capabilities and local networks. In order to provide seamless connectivity and interoperability, it is notable to maintain secure end-to-end (E2E) communication links in IoT. However, device constraints and the dynamic link creations make it challenging to use pre-shared keys for every secure E2E communication scenario in IoT. Variants of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) are adopted for constructing dynamic and secure E2E connections among the heterogeneous network devices with imbalanced resource profiles and less or no previous knowledge about each other. We propose a solution called collaborative HIP (CHIP) with an efficient key establishment component for the high resource-constrained devices in IoT. CHIP delegates the expensive cryptographic operations to the resource rich devices in the local networks. Finally, by providing quantitative performance evaluation and descriptive security analysis, we demonstrate the applicability of the key establishment in CHIP for the constrained IoT devices rather than the existing HIP variants.",

abstract="With the rapid development of the smart city and the Internet Plus-themed multi-network applications, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the data access center for the Internet of Things (DACIOT) to meet large-scale users' service requirements with low latency and high quality while sending service access requests. This paper first converts the problem of a large number of access requests to DACIOT into a distributed constraint optimization problem. Then, in order to address the optimization problem, a dynamic multi-constraint service-aware collaborative access algorithm is proposed based on dynamic load feedback from the access nodes, which can effectively reduce network congestion through load feedback and improve access performance. The algorithm firstly defines the dynamic context load sensing model, which is able to detect the load metrics of access clusters and assist access servers to work together to improve the availability of DACIOT, then it uses a heuristic falling search algorithm to search for the optimal resource on the basis of this model, after which it analyzes the convergence of the access algorithm. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the rate of success, lower the network delay of access requests and reduce network jitter when accessing DACIOT.",

abstract="In internet of things (IoT) study, to determine that the location of an event is the key issue, realize that a target location in IoT is one of the research hotspots by using the multihop range-free method. Multihop range-free could obtain relatively reasonable location estimation in the isotropic network, however, during the practical application, it tends to be affected by various anisotropic factors such as the electromagnetic interference, barriers and network attack, which can significantly reduce its performance. In accordance with these problems faced by multihop range-free, this paper proposes a novel IoT localization method: location estimation-kernel partial least squares (LE-KPLS). First of all, this method uses kernel function to define the connectivity information (hop-counts) between nodes, then, the maximum covariance is used to guide and build the inter-node localization model, and then, this model and the hop-counts between the unknown nodes and beacons are used to estimate the coordinate of the unknown nodes. Compared to the existing methods, the LE-KPLS has a high localization precision, great stability and strong generalization performance, without having a high requirement of the number of beacons, and it can well adapt to numerous complicated environments.",

Thus, this research proposes a provenance technique to deal with these issues. The technique is based on associative rules and lexical chaining methodologies, which enable traceability through the identification of propagation routes of data and object-to-object communications. Through visualization tools, the proposed methodologies also enabled us to determine linkability and unlinkability between IoT devices in a network which further leads to mechanisms to check correctness in sensor data propagation.",

abstract="Wireless networking in the Internet of Things is a challenging problem because a huge amount of devices in a relatively small region need to be interconnected. Particularly, the carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) operation of IoT devices is not viable solution, since dense network leads to high channel contentions. Moreover, given an intensive network traffic load, long queues or even queue overflows are expected, which further deteriorates network performance. To address these issue, multichannel medium access is proposed and it attracts great attention recently. In this paper, we firstly establish models based on combinatorics theory to analyze the performance of dynamic multichannel medium access. Then, a Cross-layer Cooperative Multichannel Medium Access (CCMMA) is proposed to effectively avoid channel contentions by enabling neighboring devices to communicate on orthogonal channels. The CCMMA also introduces a routing-enhanced mechanism that enables relaying nodes to wake up intelligently if there is incoming traffic, that successfully mitigates delay and queue overflow problems caused by low-power operation of IoT devices. The performance of CCMMA is evaluated through extensive simulations. The results show that it provides significant improvement in terms of quality of service over existing solutions.",

abstract="The future of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the Collaborative Internet of Things (C-IoT) in which different IoT deployments collaborate to provide better services. For instance, in smart city scenarios, C-IoT will have the potential to provide immersive multimedia user-experiences based on content and context fusion, immersive multi-sensory environments, location-based and media internet technologies, and augmented reality. However, this future paradigm will only be possible if the right decisions can be made based on the analysis of huge volumes of collected data: i.e. if the dependability of C-IoT is ensured. To address this challenge, we studied a simplified view of a C-IoT architecture composed of devices using three different technologies that have enabled the existence of IoT (RFID, NFC and Beacons). However, our proposal could be extended to any other devices in the context of C-IoT. To enhance the dependability of C-IoT, we deploy statistical data analysis techniques to improve the quality of the data obtained from identification and sensing devices and to select the most reliable devices that provide trusted (i.e. non-faulty) data in order to support accurate decision-making.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) technologies are advancing rapidly and a wide range of physical networking alternatives, communication standards and platforms are introduced. However, due to differences in system requirements and resource constraints in devices, there exist variations in these technologies, standards, and platforms. Consequently, application silos are formed. In contrast to the freedom of choice attained by a range of options, the heterogeneity of the technologies is a critical interoperability challenge faced by IoT systems. Moreover, IoT is also limited to address new requirements that arise due to the nature of the majority of smart devices. These requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, are hardly satisfied by the current IoT technologies following the end-to-end model inherited from the Internet. This paper introduces a lightweight, distributed, and embedded service bus called LISA which follows a Node Centric Networking architecture. LISA is designed to provide interoperability for resource-constrained devices in IoT. It also enables a natural way of embracing the new IoT requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, through node centric networking. LISA provides a simple application programming interface for developers, hiding the variations in platform, protocol or physical network, thus facilitating interoperability in IoT systems. LISA is inspired by network on terminal architecture (NoTA), a service centric open architecture originated by Nokia Research Center. Our extensive experimental results show the efficiency and scalability of LISA in providing a lightweight interoperability for IoT systems.",

abstract="This paper proposes a novel registration and super-resolution jointed paradigm for medical images under the Internet of thing environment. In the medical image processing, the matching issue is one catches wide attention with the domain of research. Image registration technique can be divided into similarity measure, optimization, geometric transformation, and interpolation, etc. As the first essential clue of our model, we propose the novel registration algorithm based on energy feature extraction. Generally, the matching energy function by the similarity measurement and a penalty constitution is called the external force and endogenic force separately. The matching is an external force and endogenic force mutual competition, eventually achieves the balanced process. Furtherly, we integrate the game analysis and area feature selection to achieve the better image super-resolution mode through the pretreatment of the image to change the initial value, so as to achieve the purpose of improving the performance. Besides the algorithm level innovation, we integrate the GPU and the IOT to construct the hardware based implementation of the proposed medical image processing system. The latency of registers to read and write data across a GPU's entire storage system is minimal, it is private to each thread, and can only be accessed by its owning thread. For each thread, the local memory is also private and it is often used to deal with the problem of overflow register, reducing the buffer overflow caused by the entire application of a substantial decline in the possibility and shared memory is visible to all threads within the thread block. We then achieve the optimal integration of IOT and GPU. The experimental result proves the robustness of the method.",

For this, it is necessary to detect semantic collision, with a fairly reliable method to find many semantic collision and powerful enough to run in a reasonable time. Big data fusion in Internet of Thing represents today an important data quality challenge which leads to bad decision-making. This paper proposes and compares on real data effective fusion matching methods for automatic removing semantic collision of files based on names, working with Chinese texts or English texts, and the names of people or places, in East or in the West. After conducting a more complete classification of big data fusion than the usual classifications, we introduce several methods for big data fusion. Through a simple model, we highlight a global efficiency, accuracy and recover. We propose a new measuring mechanism between records, as well as rules for automatic big data fusion. Analyses made on Internet of Thing containing real data in western cities, and on a known standard Internet of Thing containing names of companies in the China, have shown better results than those of known methods, with a lesser complexity.",

Performance rank (PR) index is calculated for each mobile ambulance based on the medical capacity (b) of the mobile ambulance, the number of patients currently using the mobile ambulance (n), and the Euclidean distance from a neighboring mobile ambulance. The minimum PR index is considered as best ambulance to provide a service to the patient. Random waypoint mobility model is used to simulate the proposed IoT based healthcare monitoring system. The proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm is compared with various node selection algorithms such as cluster based routing protocol, workload-aware channel assignment algorithm and scenario-based clustering algorithm for performance evaluation. The packet delivery fraction, normalized routing load and average end-to-end delay are calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm.

The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) is underpinned by the integration or mass customization of services and/or goods. The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as goods and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced as ``ServGoods'', resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage to the industrialized countries where the consuming customers are at the same time the co-producing producers. Adding sensors to these ServGoods and letting them connect or communicate among themselves or with other ServGoods can result in an Internet of Things (i.e., connected ServGoods).

In the work proposed, we have discussed the manner in which the Internet-of-Things based Cloud centric architecture is used for predictive analysis of physical activities of the users in sustainable health centers. The architecture proposed is based on the embedded sensors of the equipment rather than using wearable sensors or Smartphone sensors to store the value of the basic health-related parameters. Cloud centric architecture is composed of a Cloud data center, Public cloud, Private cloud, and uses the XML Web services for secure and fast communication of information. The architecture proposed here is evaluated for its adoption, prediction analysis of physical activities, efficiency, and security. From the results obtained it can be seen that the overall response between the local database server and Cloud data center remains almost constant with the rise in the number of users. For prediction analysis, If the results collected in real time for the analysis of physical activities exceed any of the parameter limits of the defined threshold value then an alert is sent to the health care personnel. Security analysis also shows the effective encryption and decryption of information. The architecture presented is effective and reduces the proliferation of information. It is also suggested, that a person suffering from any of the diseases mentioned above can defer the onset of complications by doing regular physical activities.",

abstract="As medical technology has been developing, patients' information (medical information, disease information, etc.) has been diversely used in medical services so that patients' biometric information can be used for remote diagnosis and examinations. However, since the complexity and uncertainty of patient treatment have been increasing, doctors' burden due to hospital work has been also increasing. In the present paper, an analytic hierarchy process based patient information management scheme is proposed that can synchronize diverse medical devices used for patient treatment to hierarchically manage patients' disease information. The purpose of the proposed scheme is to analyze the correlations of medical devices used in medical treatment of patients to induce hierarchical management of patients' disease information through triangle fuzzy of pairwise comparison scales for medical treatment and efficiently perform not only hospital administrative work but also patients' disease analysis and treatment. In addition, using the patients' disease information collected through diverse medical devices, the proposed scheme improves the efficiency of patient treatment methods so that hospitals can calculate the importance of treatment standards in order to hierarchically identify treatment standards. Furthermore, since the proposed scheme enables efficiently selecting treatment methods for patients' diseases, it has a characteristic of being capable of efficiently improve the ambiguousness and inaccuracy of treatment judgments and treatment compared to existing disease treatment methods. According to the results of performance evaluation, the proposed scheme improved work efficiency by 11.9{\%} over existing techniques and reduced medical device administration costs by 10.9{\%}.

abstract="Rapid proliferation in state-of-the art technologies has revolutionized the medical market for providing urgent, effective and economical health facilities to aging society. In this context media (i.e., video) transmission is considered as a quite significant step during first hour of the emergency for presenting a big and better picture of the event. However, the energy hungry media transmission process and slow progress in battery technologies have become a major and serious problem for the evolution of video technology in medical internet of things (MIoT) or internet of medical things (IoMT). So, promoting Green (i.e., energy-efficient) transmission during voluminous and variable bit rate (VBR) video in MIoT is a challenging and crucial problem for researchers and engineers. Therefore, the need arose to conduct research on Green media transmission techniques to cater the need of upcoming wearable healthcare devices. Thus, this research contributes in two distinct ways; first, a novel and sustainable Green Media Transmission Algorithm (GMTA) is proposed, second, a mathematical model and architecture of Green MIoT are designed by considering a 8-min medical media stream named, `Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis' to minimize transmission energy consumption in media-aware MIoT, and to develop feasible media transmission schedule for sensitive and urgent health information from physian to patients and vice vers through extremely power hungry natured wearable devices. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed GMTA saves energy up to 41{\%}, to serve the community.",

Emerging consumer solutions for monitoring personal health and wellness, as well as various resources from domains like internet, telecommunications and smart living, can be used as possible sources for exploration of an individual's wider health context. It was our aim to design an internet of things solutions, which would combine these sources of information into context information, complementary to health data. An internet of things platform was designed and implemented and integration with an established e-health system was provided to enrich telehealth data with context information by aggregating and processing cross-domain inputs from various sources. The approach was validated on a use case scenario. The concept was tried in a scenario related to prevention and management of heart disease. The system's advanced graphic correlation features are expected to help physicians and patients identify true roots of health problems. Medical researchers are also expected to benefit from a deeper insight into complex cross-domain parameter dependencies that determine an individual's health.",

abstract="Information Systems (ISs) have become one of the crucial tools for various organizations in managing and coordinating business processes. Now we are entering the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a paradigm in which real-world physical things can be connected to the Internet and provide services through the computing devices attached. The IoT infrastructure is starting to be integrated with ISs thereby diminishing the boundaries between the physical world and the business IT systems. With the development of IoT technologies, the number of connected things and their available physical services are increasing rapidly. Thus, selecting an appropriate service that satisfies a user's requirements from such services becomes a time-consuming challenge. To address this issue, we propose a Physical Service Model (PSM) as a common conceptual model to describe heterogeneous IoT physical services. PSM contains three core concepts (device, resource, and service) and specifies their relationships. Based on the proposed PSM, we define three types of Quality of Service (QoS) attributes and rate candidate services according to user requirements. To dynamically rate QoS values and select an appropriate physical service, we propose a Physical Service Selection (PSS) method that takes a user preference and an absolute dominance relationship among physical services into account. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

abstract="The world is confronted with a variety of interdependent problems, including scarcity, unsustainability, inequality, pollution and poor governance. Tackling such complex challenges requires coordinated action. The present paper proposes the development of a self-organizing system for coordination, called an ``offer network'', that would use the distributed intelligence of the Internet to match the offers and needs of all human, technological and natural agents on the planet. This would maximize synergy and thus minimize waste and scarcity of resources. Implementing such coordination requires a protocol that formally defines agents, offers, needs, and the network of condition-action rules or reactions that interconnect them. Matching algorithms can then determine self-sustaining subnetworks in which each consumed resource (need) is also produced (offer). After sketching the elements of a mathematical foundation for offer networks, the paper proposes a roadmap for their practical implementation. This includes step-by-step integration with technologies such as the Semantic Web, ontologies, the Internet of Things, reputation and recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, governance through legal constraints and nudging, and ecosystem modeling. The resulting intelligent platform should be able to tackle nearly all practical and theoretical problems in a bottom-up, distributed manner, thus functioning like a Global Brain for humanity.",

abstract="The technology of IoT combined with medical systems is expected to support advanced medical services. However, unsolved security problems, such as misuse of medical devices, illegal access to the medical server and so on, make IoT-based medical systems not be applied widely. In addition, users have a high burden of computation to access Things for the explosive growth of IoT devices. Because medical information is critical and important, but users have a restricted computing power, IoT-based medical systems are required to provide secure and efficient authentication for users. In this paper, we propose a selective group authentication scheme using Shamir's threshold technique. The property of selectivity gives the right of choice to users to form a group which consists of things users select and access. And users can get an access authority for those Things at a time. Thus, our scheme provides an efficient user authentication for multiple Things and conditional access authority for safe IoT-based medical information system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first in which selectivity is combined with group authentication in IoT environments.",

abstract="Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers, depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.",

Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance.

ADR prevalence is 6.7 {\%} throughout hospitals worldwide, with an international death rate of 0.32 {\%} of the total of the patients. This rate is even higher in Ambient Assisted Living environments, where 15 {\%} of the patients suffer clinically significant interactions due to patient non-compliance to drug dosage and schedule of intake in addition to suffering from polypharmacy. These instances increase with age and cause risks of drug interactions, adverse effects, and toxicity. However, with a tight follow-up of the drug treatment, complications of incorrect drug use can be reduced. For that purpose, we propose an innovative system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for the drug identification and the monitoring of medication. IoT is applied to examine drugs in order to fulfill treatment, to detect harmful side effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, liver/renal contradictions, and harmful side effects during pregnancy. The IoT design acknowledges that the aforementioned problems are worldwide so the solution supports several IoT identification technologies: barcode, Radio Frequency Identification, Near Field Communication, and a new solution developed for low-income countries based on IrDA in collaboration with the World Health Organization. These technologies are integrated in personal devices such as smart-phones, PDAs, PCs, and in our IoT-based personal healthcare device called Movital.",

However, as the number of PHDs increase, the number of other peripherals connected in PAN also increases. Therefore, PHDs are now competing for medium access with other devices, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of health applications in the PAN. In this article we present a reference architecture to prioritize PHD connections based on their state and requirements, creating a healthcare Smart Gateway. Healthcare context information is extracted by observing the traffic through the gateway. A standard-based approach was used to identify health traffic based on ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards. A reference implementation was developed showing the relevance of the problem and how the proposed architecture can assist in the prioritization.

abstract="As IoT technologies have become more available, healthcare patients increasingly want to be provided with services at places other than hospitals or their homes. Most patients with implantable devices still visit hospitals, sometimes using a self-driving car or public transportation to obtain services. When an emergency situation develops for a patient in a vehicle lacking the means to address the crisis, the patient's life cannot help but be in danger. The present paper proposes an IoT healthcare service model that will enable patients with a medical sensor to be provided healthcare services in a vehicle installed with IoT devices. To solve problems in existing models that do not include electromagnetic interference-based (EMI) multiple property management and control, the proposed model involves medical sensors with different multiple-property information guarantee targeted SINRs and minimum blackouts. The model also features the ability to connect to hospital healthcare service centers using the IoT devices installed in vehicles, thereby enabling information on the patient's condition and first aid needs to be transmitted in real time. To secure the patient's biometric data during information transmission, the proposed model weights that information to enhance the efficiency of the IoT devices. Performance evaluation results revealed that compared to existing algorithms, the communication strength of the proposed model is an average of 5.2{\%} higher, and network efficiency between IoT devices and medical sensors is an average of 7.6{\%} higher. In addition, the overhead on IoT devices was an average of 3.5{\%} lower.",

Such systems involving a diversity of an-hoc embedded and mobile electronic devices functioning with the use of a broadband Internet access and even cloud technologies, are referenced conventionally as Internet of Things systems (IoT). Due to specificity of IoT systems the application of the combined security mechanisms requires their efficient energy and computing resource consumption, identification of potential conflicts and incompatibilities, control of information flows, monitoring anomalies of data in the system and other issues. At that an increased design complexity of IoT systems is determined by a low structuring and formalization of security knowledge in the field. We proposed an approach to identification of embedded security expert knowledge for its subsequent use in automated design, verification and testing tools for secure IoT systems. The paper encompasses the core elements of the proposed technique, namely security component configuring, revelation of implicit conflicts, verification of network information flows and abnormal data from sensors. The domain specific analysis of the field of embedded security is described. We also present the revealed expert knowledge used for configuration, verification and testing of embedded devices.

But semi-active RFID tags require an onboard battery which limits their applications in many fields. For these reasons, our research focuses on power sources for the RFID tags. This paper emphasizes the circuit design and simulation of PPS. In our tests, 0.283 mW was generated by PPS at 1 Hz vibration by a 650 N impact force. The results showed that the integrated PPS could supply sufficient power for the designed PPS-RFID tag. The PPS-RFID tag can be widely used for temperature monitoring during mobile transport of perishable items such as medicines or food.",

pages="63--70",
abstract="Medication adherence is essential for the success of home care. However, it is hard to achieve in reality. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional medication assistance system that is composed of a sensor-enabled pill box and a photo message system. While most of the existing medication assistance systems enhance medication adherence by properly alerting the patients; our bidirectional system does it by the enhancement of information sharing and communications between patients and medical staff. The medication dosage states of a patient are detected by a hall-effect sensor attached to the lid of an off-the-shelf pill box. The sensor data is transferred over a ZigBee network located in the patient's home and is stored in a cloud database through a 3G mobile network. Since the raw sensor data might contain erroneous open-close events of the pill box, we developed a data filtering function to eliminate the false-positive events. With the data filtering function, we improved the accuracy of medication monitoring from 60{\%} to 85{\%} during our three-month experiment involving seven patients. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the photo message system that home visiting nurses can use to communicate with the patient. The missed medication ratio was improved from 15{\%} to 4{\%} after the photo message system was installed. The effectiveness of the photo message system continued for two months after the initiation. We also interviewed 15 medical staff about the effectiveness of the medication monitoring with the sensor-enabled pill box and the photo message system.",

Although Flickr allows users to add different groups manually, they are difficult to maintain updates when new users are added or deleted. In this paper, we put forward a series of Flickr users system that each loop contains similar users aesthetic tendency. We observed: (1) an aesthetic model of thought should be flexible, because different visual features represent different data sets. And (2) significant differences are existing in the number of photos from different Flickr users. So in our work, a new probabilistic topic model is proposed to describe the aesthetic interest of each Flickr user's potential spatial distribution. After that, an affinity graph is described by aesthetic interests of Flickr users. Obviously, intensive users of Flickr are similar in taste. Thus, these users are divided into different Flickr bounds efficient dense graph discover. It is proposed that the Flickr bound discovery is fully automatic.

abstract="With the rising trend of the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases all over the world, proactive healthcare systems with wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have attracted people's extensive attention. One of the researches, such as routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) only takes into consideration a single metric, energy, hops or routing quality, and so on. To extend the survival time of the network effectively and maximize the utilization of energy, we need to consider both node metric and link metric that affect the network, and design IRPL (Improved RPL) protocol. We propose the life cycle index (LCI) as path selection objective function. The index takes node metric (node energy and node hops) and link metric (throughput, packet loss, link quality) into consideration. In order to detect and distribute congestion information, we add congestion detection factor to the index. According to node energy, hop and congestion detection factor, we optimize the calculation method of rank. Our method redesigns parent node selection strategy. Not only does the strategy select the best parent node by using the improved index, but also saves other parent nodes that meet the conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a multipath scheme by using the DODAG structure, and use the scheme to solve the congestion problem. The simulation results show that the scheme shows better performance in terms of network load, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, percentage of the optimal parent node change, energy consumption and network lifetime.",

title="A new computing environment for collective privacy protection from constrained healthcare devices to IoT cloud services",
journal="Cluster Computing",
year="2017",
month="Nov",
day="11",
abstract="The Internet of healthcare things is essentially a new model that changes the way of the delivery and management of healthcare services. It utilizes digital sensors and cloud computing to present a quality healthcare service outside of the classical hospital environment. This resulted in the emergence of a new class of online web 4.0 services, which are termed ``cloud healthcare services''. Cloud healthcare services offer a straightforward opportunity for patients to communicate with healthcare professionals and utilize their personal IoHT devices to obtain timely and accurate medical guidance and decisions. The personal IoHT devices integrate sensed health data at a central cloud healthcare service to extract useful health insights for wellness and preventive care strategies. However, the present practices for cloud healthcare services rely on a centralized approach, where patients' health data are collected and stored on servers, located at remote locations, which might be functioning under data privacy laws somewhat different from the ones applied where the service is running. Promoting a privacy respecting cloud services encourages patients to actively participate in these healthcare services and to routinely provide an accurate and precious health data about themselves. With the emergence of fog computing paradigm, privacy protection can now be enforced at the edge of the patient's network regardless of the location of service providers. In this paper, a framework for cloud healthcare recommender service is presented. We depicted the personal gateways at the patients' side act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between IoHT devices and cloud healthcare services. A fog-based middleware will be hosted on these fog nodes for an efficient aggregation of patients generated health data while maintaining the privacy and the confidentiality of their health profiles. The proposed middleware executes a two-stage concealment process that utilizes the hierarchical nature of IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. At that, the patients will be empowered with a tool to control the privacy of their health data by enabling them to release their health data in a concealed form. The further processing at the cloud healthcare service continues over the concealed data by applying the proposed protocols. The proposed solution was integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the patients' health data when utilized by a cloud healthcare recommender service to generate health insights. Our approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both patients and service providers.",

Since the advent of 4D printing, much research has been conducted on smart materials and application of 4D printing in diverse areas. However, research and development of 4D printing software is very limited due to the fact that 4D printing technology is still a novelty. Nevertheless, the time characteristics of 4D printing require appropriate 4D printing software to produce effective 4D printing outputs. In this article, we first introduce 4D printing technology and discuss its application in various fields. Then, we focus on the software required for 4D printing. More specifically, we present six types of software solutions needed to fully support corresponding stages in the 4D printing process: simulation, modeling, slicing, host/firmware, monitoring, and printing management software (PMS), respectively. We discuss how each software solution can sufficiently carry out the designated functions at each stage of the 4D printing process and propose that these software solutions can together provide all of the required operations for 4D printing.",

The virtual experimental environment includes the theoretical calculation on simplified 5-DOF human body vibration model, the vibration simulation and analysis within ADAMS/VibrationTM module, and the digital human biomechanics and occupational health analysis in Jack software. While the real experimental environment provides realistic and accurate test results, it also serves as core and validation for the virtual experimental environment.

The rapid deployment of high-speed Internet allows humans to interact using a rich set of multimedia data such as texts, pictures, and videos. This position paper proposes to define a new research area called `connected multimedia', which is the study of a collection of research issues of the super-area social media that receive little attention in the literature. By connected multimedia, we mean the study of the social and technical interactions among users, multimedia data, and devices across cultures and explicitly exploiting the cultural differences.

The modern healthcare system requires an overhaul of traditional healthcare software/hardware paradigms, which are ill-equipped to cope with the volume and diversity of the modern health data and must be augmented with new ``big data'' computing and analysis capabilities. For researchers, there is an opportunity in healthcare data analytics to study this vast amount of data, find patterns and trends within data and provide a solution for improving healthcare, thereby reducing costs, democratizing health access, and saving valuable human lives. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of different big data analytics integrated healthcare systems and describe the various applicable healthcare data analytics algorithms, techniques, and tools that may be deployed in wireless, cloud, Internet of Things settings. Finally, the contribution is given in formation of a convergence point of all these platforms in form of SmartHealth that could result in contributing to unified standard learning healthcare system for future.",

The proposed recommender system socially matches wireless devices to communicate and share their contents based on similarities, distance, velocity, wireless channel quality and remaining energy. The physical layer connections are realized by device-to-device spectrum sharing techniques, and we accordingly designed a cooperative multicast service case to make full use of the wireless broadcasting nature. A ``green communication'' orientated algorithm is proposed to allocate power resources, adaptively adjust data rate and recommend partners as mobile relays.

This issue has been attracting a growing interest, in particular because of the anxiety generated by the idea that digital technologies could cancel a large number of jobs. Although I agree with argument put forward in opposition to the existence of a causal link between technological innovation and increased productivity at the macroeconomic level, I believe that the novelty and pervasiveness of digital technologies require more in-depth micro-level analysis in order to understand the extent to which new digital technologies are currently employed by leading manufacturing companies and the ways new technologies are affecting employment. The empirical findings show that among the different technologies included under the umbrella of Industry 4.0, mainly robots have received a great deal of attention so far, while the current application and employment impact for other emerging technological opportunities such as 3D printing, Internet of Things, Augmented reality, Big data Analytics have not been studied yet.

While there is much hype, little research has been conducted that informs companies about how to profitably integrate the IoT with strategic or operational processes. This paper views the IoT through the lens of predictive maintenance -- the use of real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to dynamically manage preventive maintenance policies. These are being used by numerous manufacturing organizations to transition from product-oriented to service-oriented business models. In particular, we analyze optimal preventive maintenance policies in an environment where equipment is subject to a deterioration, which shifts it from its initial, fully-productive state, having a specified, age-dependent failure rate to a less-productive or deteriorated state, having a different, presumably higher, age-dependent failure rate. The deterioration, itself, is a random process.",

It is evident that smart cities should accommodate every citizen, most especially those who may struggle with accessing information through conventional mediums. Specifically, smart cities must ensure that full participation is available to those citizens with communication and learning disabilities and new immigrant populations who experience difficulties understanding the language of their new home county. The biggest challenge for these citizens is using the Internet for learning because of the need to read, view, or listen to content published online. Disabled students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses at colleges and universities are at a particular disadvantage since the use of empirical observation is critical in scientific learning and research. In this paper, we propose an intervention using a new software product and workflow for video captioning---a Universal Video Captioning platform (UVC). This platform provides a semi-automatic approach to synchronize the captioning into accessible STEM-related videos. It has the potential to transform learning and teaching for students with disabilities and those whose native language is not English by integrating synchronized captioned educational videos into undergraduate and graduate STEM disciplines. While accessing scientific content can pose unique challenges for disabled students and those who have just started learning a new language, the UVC platform has the potential to provide students with disabilities and recent immigrants the ability to pursue new and deeper learning opportunities.",

Still, due to security vulnerabilities, personal health and medical information is prone to hacking attacks. Thus, concerns over privacy invasion have come to the fore, and at the same time security issues are considered to override information services. This paper proposes a communication protocol based on hash lock, session keys, random numbers and security keys designed to be safe against intruders' hacking attempts in information communication between medical devices. Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program. In brief, the proposed communication protocol for medical devices is safe and secure against diverse attacks.",

abstract="eHealth is supported by electronic processes and communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) is utilized to realize smart healthcare, backup terminal devices are required for reliable eHealth services, and the IoT control system is essential for the security of IoT applications. In 2013, Yang et al. first added backup terminal devices, a status monitor device and an alarm module to the IoT control system and proposed an authentication mechanism for availability and security. In 2016, Chang et al. found that Yang et al.'s authentication model suffers from some drawbacks. In this paper, we adjust the operation and requirements of the IoT control system and take user anonymity into consideration to propose an authentication model for the IoT control system for reliable and anonymous eHealth services. To ensure anonymity of the user and the accessed service, the real identifiers will not be transmitted for untraceability. The proposed authentication model complies with six essential requirements. Via the proposed authentication model, the IoT control system can ensure reliable and anonymous eHealth services with anonymity, availability and security.",

The aim of this review is to present current state-of-the-art approach in the field of wearable system based cancer detection and identify key challenges that resist it from clinical adoption. A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45{\%} research articles and 55{\%} manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3{\%}), skin cancer (36.3{\%}), prostate cancer (18.1{\%}), and multi-type cancer (9{\%}). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system. It is well comprehended that upon sincere orientation of all identified challenges, wearable systems would emerge as vital alternative to futuristic cancer detection.",

A range of several hundred meters, data rates of several hundred kbits, and low latency are key requirements in widespread premises. This paper addresses the investigation and development of a novel communication technology that is highly suitable for a robust and interoperable micro-grid control and local energy management.

The IoTs have innumerable daily life applications. The healthcare industry particularly has been benefited due to the provision of ubiquitous health monitoring, emergency response services, electronic medical billing, etc. Since IoT devices possess limited storage and processing power, therefore these intelligent objects are unable to efficiently provide the e-health facilities, or process and store enormous amount of collected data. IoTs are merged with Cloud Computing technology in Multi-Cloud form that basically helps cover the limitations of IoTs by offering a secure and on-demand shared pool of resources i.e., networks, servers, storage, applications, etc., to deliver effective and well-organized e-health amenities. Although the framework based on the integration of IoT and Multi-Cloud is contributing towards better patient care, yet on the contrary, it is challenging the privacy and reliability of the patients' information. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the top security threat and to evaluate the existing security techniques used to combat this attack and their applicability in IoT and Multi-Cloud based e-Healthcare environment.",

abstract="Nowadays, tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is seen in smart environments such as medical remote care applications which are crucial due to the general aging of the population. With the recent advancements in IoT-based healthcare technologies, activity recognition can be used as the key part of the intelligent healthcare systems to monitor elderly people to live independently at homes and promote a better care. Recently, the evidence theory and its derivates approaches began to take place in the fields of activity recognition in these smart systems. However, these approaches are generally inconsistent with the probability calculus due to the lower and upper probability bounds considering the combined evidences. To overcome these challenges and to get more precisely the reconcilement between the evidence theory with the frequentist approach of probability calculus, this work proposes a new methodology for combining beliefs, addressing some of the disadvantages exhibited by the evidence theory and its derivatives. This methodology merges the non-normalized conjunctive and the majority rules. The proposed rule is evaluated in numerical simulation case studies involving the activity recognition in a smart home environment. The results show that this strategy produces intuitive results in favor of the more committed hypothesis.",

month="May",
day="23",
abstract="In an attempt to develop an understanding of existing research trends and to inform the development of new research in the field of telecommunications, literature reviews are being conducted. As an effort for investigating research trend, our research suggests the application of a text mining analysis technique to identify the knowledge structures of academic research in the field of telecommunications policy and to pinpoint future research opportunities. In this study, three analytical techniques were employed: a productivity analysis; a contents analysis based on topic modeling and word co-occurrence; and an author co-citation analysis based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, multidimensional scaling, and a factor analysis. The findings from the research productivity analysis imply that the journal `Telecommunications Policy' has greatly contributed to the publication of studies related to telecommunications policy. Moreover, our research institution analysis results indicate that telecommunication policy studies are undertaken by experts in various research fields. The contents and citation analysis results demonstrate that many studies related to telecommunications policy cover infrastructure-related topics, including the design, arrangement, and distribution of telecommunications networks. By contrast, recent studies are found to focus on the privacy and digital divide issues that may arise in connection with the application of telecommunications networks to other information technologies or industrial areas. However, the area of policy research that focuses on the application of information technologies still concentrates on the methods for the application of existing services---such as broadcasting and multimedia---without paying sufficient attention to the policy issues that may arise from the application of cloud computing, the Internet of Things, or big data analytics, services that have emerged with the recent expansion of wireless communications networks. In this sense, there is a need for discussions about the policies to respond to the increasing use of radio frequencies owing to the expansion of the Internet of Things, and to promote the efficient and safe control of data transmitted in real time on the wireless Internet. Studies of new technologies in the telecommunications policy field should be carried out in view of local and national characteristics. At the same time, further studies should consider efficient and reasonable ways to export telecommunications and networking technologies to countries that seek to invest in or expand their telecommunications networks to new information technologies. Expanding on this research, more text mining techniques for analyzing large amounts of text data and for clustering and visualizing them need to be considered.",

With computation at user-end, it provides a fog-based computing paradigm to generate time senstive results, which along with cloud storage presents a comprehensive Fog-Cloud computing paradigm. Because of these reasons, the work presented in this paper focuses on utilizing the potential of IoT Technology to provide a novel Fog-Cloud architecture for efficient healthcare services in smart office. Specifically, a Fog-Cloud architecture has been proposed to monitor and analyze various health attributes of a person during his working hours. Moreover, the framework indulges various activities in the ambient office environment with the purpose of analyzing it for health severity. In order to realize this, a probabilistic measure, named as Severity Index (SI) is defined to evaluate the adverse effects of different activities on personal health. Finally, an application scenario of temporal healthcare predictive monitoring and alert generation is discussed to depict the ideology of Smart Office Healthcare. In order to validate the system, an experimental implmentation is performed on heterogenous datasets. The results obtained in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed model is highly efficient and accurate for providing appropriate healthcare environment during working hours of a person in a smart office.",

abstract="Nowadays, multimedia is considered to be the biggest big data as it dominates the traffic in the Internet and mobile phones. Currently symmetric encryption algorithms are used in IoT but when considering multimedia big data in IoT, symmetric encryption algorithms incur more computational cost. In this paper, we have designed and developed a resource-efficient encryption system for encrypting multimedia big data in IoT. The proposed system takes the advantages of the Feistel Encryption Scheme, an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and genetic algorithms. To satisfy high throughput, the GPU has also been used in the proposed system. This system is evaluated on real IoT medical multimedia data to benchmark the encryption algorithms such as MARS, RC6, 3-DES, DES, and Blowfish in terms of computational running time and throughput for both encryption and decryption processes as well as the avalanche effect. The results show that the proposed system has the lowest running time and highest throughput for both encryption and decryption processes and highest avalanche effect with compared to the existing encryption algorithms. To satisfy the security objective, the developed algorithm has better Avalanche Effect with compared to any of the other existing algorithms and hence can be incorporated in the process of encryption/decryption of any plain multimedia big data. Also, it has shown that the classical and modern ciphers have very less Avalanche Effect and hence cannot be used for encryption of confidential multimedia messages or confidential big data. The developed encryption algorithm has higher Avalanche Effect and for instance, AES in the proposed system has an Avalanche Effect of {\%}52.50. Therefore, such system is able to secure the multimedia big data against real-time attacks.",

abstract="Determination of accurate modeling parameters of optical materials prior to defining the materials in the simulation model is fundamentally important to obtain simulation results close to the experimental ones. However, extracting modeling parameters of optical materials is inherently difficult because it involves fitting both real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivity using a single set of parameters. In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm called differential evolution (DE) has been utilized to extract the optical modeling parameters of graphene oxide. The performance of DE to find the optimal results has been analyzed by using different objective functions and boundary values. Two objective functions are used out of which one is proposed by us. Root-means-square (RMS) deviation, a measure of accuracy of the numerically obtained results has been determined for each case. From the obtained results it has been found that the DE algorithm extracted the optical modeling parameters successfully with very small RMS deviation for both real and imaginary parts of the complex relative permittivity.",

abstract="An earthquake significant on the Richter scale occurring in an area with a high population density requires an effective and equitable emergency response plan. Emergency resources are usually located in so-called responding centers. One of the first problems faced by disaster-response management personnel in the rapidly degrading post-earthquake conditions is to gage the hazard rate to which the disaster-affected area is subjected, estimate the time taken to bring the situation under control, also called restoration time, and select the appropriate responding center for relief-and-rescue activities. In this paper, we propose an elaborate semi-Markov model to capture the stochastic dynamics of the events that follow an earthquake, which will be used to quantify the hazard rate to which people are exposed and estimate the restoration time. The model will be further used, via dynamic programming, to determine the appropriate responding center. Our proposed model can be employed in conjunction with a variety of hazard scales and by collecting data on a few parameters related to emergency management. The model will be particularly useful in a smart city, where historic data on events following an earthquake would be systematically and accurately recorded.",

abstract="Sleep plays a significant role in human' smental and physical health. Recently, the associations between lack of sleep and weight gain, development of cancer and many other health problems have been recognized. Then monitoring the sleep and wake state all night is becoming a hotspot issue. Traditionally it classified by a PSG recording which is very costly and uncomfortable. Nowadays, with the advance of internet of things, many convenient wearable devices are being used for medical use, like measuring the heart rate (HR), blood pressure and other signals. With the sleep quality monitor problem, the key question is how to discriminate the sleep and weak stage from these signals. This paper proposed a Bayesian approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW) method for sleep and wake classification. It used HR and surplus pulse O2 (SPO2) signals to analyze the sleep states and the occurrence of some sleep-related problems. DTW is an algorithm that searches an optimal alignment between time series with scaling and shifting and Bayesian methods have been successfully used for object classification in many study. In this paper, a three-step process is used for sleep and wake classification. In the first step, the DTW is used to extract features of the original HR and SPO2 signals. Then a probabilistic model is introduced for using the Bayesian classification for uncertain data. And in the classification step, the DTW features are used as the training dataset in the Bayesian approach for sleep and wake classification. Finally, a case study form a real-word applications, collected from the website of the Sleep Heart Health Study, is presented to shown the feasibility and advantages of the DTW-based Bayesian approach.",

abstract="Motivated by advances in mass customization in business practice, explosion in the number of internet of things devices, and the lack of published research on privacy differentiation and customization, we propose a contextual information relevance model of privacy. We acknowledge the existence of individual differences with respect to unique security and privacy protection needs. We observe and argue that it is unfair and socially inefficient to treat privacy in a uniform (or less differentiated) manner whereby a large proportion of the population remain unsatisfied by a common policy. Our research results provide quantifiable means to measure and evaluate the customized privacy. We show that with privacy differentiation, the social planner will observe increases in demand and overall social welfare. Our results also show that business practitioners could profit from privacy customization.",

abstract="The paper addresses the Be Responsible platform, a representative example of human-centric sensing network which, relying on the Info-Communication and Internet of Things concepts, aims to improve the communication between citizens, on one side, and government authorities, on the other side, with the purpose of resolving various problems encountered in a modern society. A widespread network of human-centric smartphone devices and PCs has been used as a valuable source of data collected and processed in order to trigger adequate actions upon problem resolving. In this way, humans acting as sensor operators and data sources become a powerful factor in improving their society. The Be Responsible platform enables the people to report the irregularities in various aspects of their social life (grey economy, misuse of government vehicles, ecology, traffic), and hence to take active part in resolving them. It also promotes positive and responsible social and institutional behavior, which has to be nurtured in any society seeking progress. The number of submitted reports as well as the money collected from the fine revenues and subsequently invested in projects of social good, undoubtedly prove that what could not be achieved through years of traditional government-led policy approach, was achieved in months of citizen engagement.",

abstract="This paper presents a systematic literature review of papers that were published in academic journals on the applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) in supply chain management between the years 2000 and 2015. As the literature on RFID is not confined to specific disciplines or repositories, this paper proposes a discipline-based framework for classifying RFID literature. Five main classification categories are used in this paper: technology, supply chain management, research methodology, application industries, and social aspects. The paper then focuses on the category of supply chain management and reviews 1187 articles that were published between 2000 and 2015 in rated journals. All the papers reviewed are further classified into eight subclasses under this category of supply chain management. The review yields useful insights into the anatomy of RFID literature in supply chain management, enhances evidence-based knowledge, and contributes to informing practice, policymaking and future research. The review reveals that even presently, despite technical and cost challenges, enormous potential exists for the application of RFID in several areas of supply chain management and the prospects are likely to grow into the future. Since RFID solutions have emerged primarily over only the past 20 years, significant research opportunities exist and would need to be addressed to continue to support the technology's maturation, evaluation, adoption, implementation, and diffusion.",

abstract="Recently, the significance of internet of things (IoT) is rapidly growing in the next generation of information and communication technology due to rapid advances in wireless communication technologies which have triggered the development of low-power, reliable and miniaturized devices. These advances lead to the creation of IoT ecosystem that enables development of various services. Especially, there are a number of attempts to apply communication technology of IoT in the field of healthcare services which deals with medical applications such as a remote medical treatment. In IoT-based healthcare system, in general, a number of medical devices are densely deployed in narrow area. Therefore, they are exposed to signal interference among them which causes significant performance degradation. In this paper, we present an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based network interface and channel selection algorithm for multi-channel MAC protocols in IoT ecosystem that take into account a multitude of decision factors, such as expected channel condition, latency and frame reception ratio. The proposed scheme can provide flexibility for various requirements of different medical services through performing AHP. In particular, the proposed scheme considers IoT-based healthcare system because it is the most complex scenario of fundamental IoT applications. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive simulations, and the simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm provides low latency and high reliability.",

This algorithm is combined with the artificial neural network and Bayesian algorithm according to the practical applications of the drug control system of the Internet of Things. The algorithm is divided into two parts: first, the artificial neural network algorithm is used to estimate the data of WSNs, the results are the reference for the conversion of routing node frequency; second, by using the Bayesian formula, valuation method, and the CSMA/CA's collision detection mechanism, the algorithm adjusts the frequency of the routing node and the relevant node frequency to establish the normal communication of packets sent by nodes and the aggregation node packets. In this way, it will reduce the collision detection and the back off time and avoid data packet duplication. The simulation tool-NS2 is used to configure an appropriate simulation scene for the experiment, which analyses and compares the received packet rate, the overall energy consumption of the network, and so on. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm ensures high energy efficiency and balanced energy consumption. Therefore the results show that the improved algorithm increases the efficiency, so that the network has the function of intelligent learning.",

And, for the compliance to delivery deadline, the SCM system that integrates the manufacturing process covering from the material purchase to the product release and the demand process covering from the logistics to the sales process is required. To guarantee the manufacturing quality, a system that maintains the optimized rate-of-production by responding in advance to any fault occurrence in the process and/or the facility is required.

abstract="In recent years, applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) have become a part of our everyday life. Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are a new and emerging application of IoT that contain sensor nodes equipped with cameras, microphones, and other sensors producing multimedia content. ZigBee is the most common standard radio protocol used in WMSNs because of its lightweight standard and its low-cost and low-power characteristics. Most ZigBee network systems are constructed using the tree topology. Using the root node, intermediate nodes, and leaves of this topology, packets can be easily forwarded to the next hop by the tree routing mechanism, which calculates the packet destination address using the distributed address assignment mechanism. However, network parameter constraints cause the orphan node problem. Therefore, we proposed a novel recommendation scheme, the ZigBee connectivity enhancement mechanism (ZCEM), based on the improvement probability and improvement effect of multiparent nodes (MNs) in ZigBee networks. The ZCEM chooses MNs with better IP to connect to other parent nodes to increase the connectivity of ZigBee networks, reducing the number of orphan nodes. The ZCEM is compared to the standard ZigBee mechanism and the ZigBee connectivity-improving mechanism (ZCIM). The results show that the proposed ZCEM improves connectivity in ZigBee networks. The proposed mechanism can achieve a join ratio of 90{\%}, approximately 3{\%} more efficient than the ZCIM, and is 6{\%} more efficient than the standard ZigBee mechanism.",

If IoT is enabled in the Smart Grid (SG), it can benefit from advantages of the IoT such as interoperability, connectivity, etc. By combining the IoT with energy harvesting (EH) and cognitive radio (CR) techniques, the problems of SG, such as harsh channel conditions and limited battery power, may be resolved. Hence, incorporation of EH and CR reveals a new networking paradigm for IoT-enabled SG. To this end, we first introduce CR usage in the IoT-enabled SG, and explain the advantages and challenges of CRs. Furthermore, we propose EH approaches for the resource constraint of wireless devices in the IoT-enabled SG. Operation and node architecture of energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CR), and network architecture of the IoT-enabled SG are described to explain details of our networking paradigm. Open issues and future research directions are discussed to enable this new paradigm.",

abstract="Sensors and actuators are being increasingly deployed for monitoring and controlling different phenomena and processes in a stand-alone manner or attached to sensor nodes with communication capabilities as part of larger wireless sensor networks (WSN). In addition to the protocols for communication within the WSN, sensor nodes may also provide the gateway functionality towards other networks and/or support communication with other external devices. These devices either represent additional gateways for exposing data and metadata to external networks, or serve as connection points to WSN for instance for the on-site calibration and maintenance. Smartphones as advanced mobile terminals appear particularly suitable for such role. This paper investigates the role a smartphone augmented with WSN gateway functionality can play in WSN with respect to regular dedicated sensor and gateway nodes. As a practical example we show the implementation of a gateway augmented smartphone using a Samsung i8910 phone and a VESNA sensor node connected via Bluetooth. The role of a gateway augmented smartphone is to interface between WSN, which is using a proprietary networking protocol, and the mobile network. The data obtained from WSN can be enriched using smartphone's embedded sensors before being sent to the remote server. We demonstrate this on an example of geo-tagging the collected data from WSN with the smartphone's Global Positioning System-based location data.",

In tourism as an ``information business'', Information Technology has always played an important role since the 1960s with the computerized reservation systems/global distribution systems; these were one of the first world-wide electronic networks. And since the beginning of the Web in the early 1990s, travel and tourism was and is a major application domain for Web-based services.

Software-controlled sensors, actuators and smart objects enable a close coupling of the cyber and physical worlds. Introducing processes into CPS to automate repetitive tasks promises advantages regarding resource utilization and flexibility of control systems for smart spaces. However, process execution systems face new challenges when being adapted for process execution in CPS: the automated processing of sensor events and data, the dynamic invocation of services, the integration of human interaction, and the synchronization of the cyber and physical worlds. Current workflow engines fulfill these requirements only to a certain degree. In this work, we present PROtEUS---an integrated system for process execution in CPS. PROtEUS integrates components for event processing, data routing, dynamic service selection and human interaction on the modeling and execution level. It is the basis for executing self-healing model-based workflows in CPS. We demonstrate the applicability of PROtEUS within two case studies from the Smart Home domain and discuss its feasibility for introducing workflows into cyber-physical systems.",

A novel architecture based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), wearable sensor technology, and cloud computing infrastructure is proposed for the detection and monitoring of Ebola infected patients. The aim of this work is to prevent the spreading of the infection at the early stage of the outbreak. The J48 decision tree is used to evaluate the level of infection in a user depending on his symptoms. RFID is used to automatically sense the close proximity interactions (CPIs) between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to describe and monitor the current state of the outbreak using the CPI data.

abstract="Smart sensor networks (SSNs) play a crucial role in an industrial internet of things (IIoT). SSNs are also a key enabling technology for future IIoT. The main challenge in designing these networks is coping with the reliability and real-time communication limitations that characterize the network architecture. In this manuscript, first, a master/slave SSN architecture based on the high-performance Modbus communication protocol was proposed. An SSN with this architecture consists of a master controller and distributed slave sensors. Next, a smart sensor management engine that enables the control of sensor node addition, insertion, removal, automatic configuring, error processing in, and ID management of the sensor network was designed for the SSN master controller. Finally, two high-performance Modbus application-specific integrated circuits were developed for the SSN master and SSN slave. The proposed SSN solution improves the SSN performance 100 times compared with the conventional software solution.

abstract="In this essay, we outline some important concerns in the hope of improving the effectiveness of security and privacy research. We discuss the need to re-examine our understanding of information technology and information system (IS) artefacts and to expand the range of the latter to include those artificial phenomena that are crucial to information security and privacy research. We then briefly discuss some prevalent limitations in theory, methodology, and contributions that generally weaken security/privacy studies and jeopardise their chances of publication in a top IS journal. More importantly, we suggest remedies for these weaknesses, identifying specific improvements that can be made and offering a couple of illustrations of such improvements. In particular, we address the notion of loose re-contextualisation, using deterrence theory research as an example. We also provide an illustration of how the focus on intentions may have resulted in an underuse of powerful theories in security and privacy research, because such theories explain more than just intentions. We then outline three promising opportunities for IS research that should be particularly compelling to security and privacy researchers: online platforms, the Internet of things, and big data. All of these carry innate information security and privacy risks and vulnerabilities that can be addressed only by researching each link of the systems chain, that is, technologies--policies--processes--people--society--economy--legislature. We conclude by suggesting several specific opportunities for new research in these areas.",

abstract="Cloud computing is a mature technology that provides a huge leap in elastic computation, and new development trends are shaped to compliment the cloud computing paradigm. Cisco recently introduced the concept of Fog Computing to enable applications on billions of devices that are already connected and form the Internet of Things at the edge of the network. With the view point that the fog computing paradigm will be the future of computing technology, we look at its strong characteristics and propose a novel approach to enable a new kind of service called Offload As A Service (OaaS). Offload computation has been an active research area for many years and provides the capability to extend mobile resources limitations in terms of CPU, GPU, memory, storage and battery energy. Fog computing paradigm is a good synergy for offload computation technology with its low delay and close proximity features. To realize the enabling of OaaS in a fog computing environment, we propose a novel framework for communication and an offloading mechanism between different layers of the fog infrastructure, using matching algorithm to handle the fair mapping between users and service providers. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposal. Simulation results of our work have shown great potential and value based on the prototype implementation, especially in the running time of tasks, which was reduced significantly with improvements of up to 37 and                                                                           {\$}{\$}12{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                                                                                    12                        {\%}                                                                             observed for photos offloaded to ``PC'' and ``Odroid'', respectively, compared to the local running time on the user device.",

abstract="Nowadays, thanks to the hardware costs reduction everyone at home owns at least one hi-technology devices to support life quality. This paper proposes a new methodology to analyse the indoor air quality with a cheap and third-age-dedicated device. A new prototype, called Home Pollution Embedded System (HOPES), was developed to give simple and understandable information, also comprehensible for people with cognitive problems or that are not familiar with new technologies. The device gathers pollutants data and displays to the user different air pollutants concentrations, from toxics gasses up to explosives. Moreover, an overall air quality index has been elaborated and is displayed by HOPES with lights and numerical information. HOPES is an Internet of things device that works in real time and that can be connected to the web and to a geographic information system platform to add spatial information of each pollutant. The hardware architecture employs a set of gas semiconductor sensors and an IR particulate matter sensor. Experimental results demonstrated that HOPES has an accurate sensor response and is suitable to be used with the proposed indices. In fact, despite of the poor-selective metal oxide sensors, the results highlighted how it is possible to get useful air quality information with a cheap device. However, the system needs more tests to validate the sensors array with different substances.",

The mode of interaction has not changed, and still requires adaption of humans to the system.

The NII (National Institute of Informatics) is Japan's primary academic research body in evolving social infrastructures. Wiener's vision of ``cybernetics'' and the objectives associated with the internationally almost forgotten term ``informatics'' may help in detecting the unifying ``ribbon'' around seemingly loosely coupled projects. While Wiener describes the conjunction of control and communication, where in a closed feedback loop the control logic is driven by physical measures, the NII extends this model to include humans, which expands the challenges of the control logic to the conjunction of cyberspace and physical processes. This may have social impacts as well as technical challenges, such as the ability to build a reverse interaction model. In addition, future development may lead to the emergence of unintended, unpredictable safety, reliability, and acceptance problems. ",

The flexibility offered through big data analytics empowers functional as well as firm-level performance. In the first phase of the study, we attempt to analyze the research on big data published in high-quality business management journals. The analysis was visualized using tools for big data and text mining to understand the dominant themes and how they are connected. Subsequently, an industry-specific categorization of the studies was done to understand the key use cases. It was found that most of the existing research focuses majorly on consumer discretionary, followed by public administration. Methodologically, a major focus in such exploration is in social media analytics, text mining and machine learning applications for meeting objectives in marketing and supply chain management. However, it was found that not much focus was highlighted in these studies to demonstrate the tools used for the analysis. To address this gap, this study also discusses the evolution, types and usage of big data tools. The brief overview of big data technologies grouped by the services they enable and some of their applications are presented. The study categorizes these tools into big data analysis platforms, databases and data warehouses, programming languages, search tools, and data aggregation and transfer tools.

IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) is the great option for realizing IoT. IEEE 802.15.4 defines the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers of 6LoWPAN. MAC layer of 6LoWPAN plays an important role in the efficient utilization of resources and energy consumption of 6LoWPAN devices. The contribution of this paper is the improvement of resource utilization of 6LoWPAN devices including energy consumption and delay using Lamport's algorithm in the MAC layer instead of the conventional carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance approach. The proposed Lamport's algorithm protocol shows a significant improvement in energy consumption and throughput of 6LoWPAN devices.",

In this paper, we present a secure and fine-grained data access control scheme for constrained IoT devices and cloud computing based on hierarchical attribute-based encryption, which reduces the key management by introducing hierarchical attribute authorities. In order to relieve local computation burden, we propose an outsourced encryption and decryption construction by delegating most of laborious operations to gateway and cloud server. Further, our scheme achieves efficient policy updating, which allows the sender device to update access policies without retrieving and re-encrypting the data.

abstract="The rapid introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology has boosted the service deliverance aspects of health sector in terms of m-health, and remote patient monitoring. IoT Technology is not only capable of sensing the acute details of sensitive events from wider perspectives, but it also provides a means to deliver services in time sensitive and efficient manner. Henceforth, IoT Technology has been efficiently adopted in different fields of the healthcare domain. In this paper, a framework for IoT based patient monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is presented to enhance the deliverance of curative services. Though ICUs remained a center of attraction for high quality care among researchers, still number of studies have depicted the vulnerability to a patient's life during ICU stay. The work presented in this study addresses such concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of various events (and anomalies) with temporal associations, followed by time sensitive alert generation procedure. In order to validate the system, it was deployed in 3 ICU room facilities for 30 days in which nearly 81 patients were monitored during their ICU stay. The results obtained after implementation depicts that IoT equipped ICUs are more efficient in monitoring sensitive events as compared to manual monitoring and traditional Tele-ICU monitoring. Moreover, the adopted methodology for alert generation with information presentation further enhances the utility of the system.",

abstract="As healthcare is one of major socioeconomic problems in cities, mobile healthcare network becomes one of core components of smart cities, which would improve urban healthcare environment. However, there are wide privacy concerns as personal health information is outsourced to untrusted cloud servers. It is a promising method to encrypt the health data before outsourcing, but how to do diagnosis computations on the encrypted health data remains an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a general architecture of the mobile healthcare network, and define three typical secure medical computations, which include the average heart rate, the long QT syndrome detection, and the chi-square tests. To achieve computations on the ciphertext, we leverage fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt the health data. Different from previous related works, we use more efficient Dowlin's FHE scheme to implement above three medical computations. In our implementation of the average heart rate, only one ciphertext is sent back to the receiver, so homomorphic decryption is needed once. We take an efficient l-bits comparator to implement the long QT syndrome detection, which only needs l XOR operations and one homomorphic multiplication. We first implement the chi-square tests by homomorphic additions and homomorphic multiplications, which can be used to study whether varicose veins is relevant to overweight. Extensive simulations and analytical results show the scalability and efficiency of our proposed scheme.",

abstract="Healthy people are important for any nation's development. Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called ``Big Data.'' Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called ``Intelligent Building,'' depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system has the capability of efficiently processing WBAN sensory data from millions of users in order to perform real-time responses in case of emergencies.",

These will probe and monitor cities and endangered species, the atmosphere, our ships, highways and fleets of trucks, our conversations, our bodies--even our dreams ....What will the earth's new skin permit us to feel? How will we use its surges of sensation? For several years--maybe for a decade--there will be no central nervous system to manage this vast signaling network. Certainly there will be no central intelligence...some qualities of self-awareness will emerge once the Net is sensually enhanced. Sensuality is only one force pushing the Net toward intelligence''.These statements are quoted by an interview by Cherry Murray, Dean of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Professor of Physics. It is interesting to outline the timeliness and highly predicting power of these statements. In particular, we would like to point to the relevance of the question ``What will the earth's new skin permit us to feel?'' to the work we are going to discuss in this paper. There are many additional compelling questions, as for example: ``How can the electronic earth's skin be made more resilient?''; ``How can the earth's electronic skin be improved to better satisfy the need of our society?'';``What can the science of complex systems contribute to this endeavour?''",

title="A Query-oriented Adaptive Indexing Technique for Smart Grid Big Data Analytics",
journal="Journal of Signal Processing Systems",

month="Aug",
day="08",
abstract="IoT (Internet of Things) based Smart Grid (SG) is defined as a power grid integrated with a large network of smart objects portrayed by information and communication technology. The data sources of IoT-based SG, as well as their correlations, are usually perplexing, which necessitate indexing techniques for complex queries over the SG dataset to efficiently exploit the rich connotations of data to enable characteristic analytics and fault prediction. As part of popular big data platform, HBase is replacing classic relational data- bases to host huge heterogeneous data records in the form of key-value storage. However, most existing secondary index schemes on HBase are managed and retrieved by corresponding data columns instead of queries to incur inefficiency in answering a complex data query. In this paper, we propose an adaptive indexing technique to speed up a complex data query on HBase for IoT-based SG big data. Our proposed method is based on the observation that most analyses over big power grid data focus on data subsets related to specific power grid events or monitoring data instead of the whole dataset. Theoretical analysis and experimental test show that the proposed query-oriented secondary indexing scheme is feasible in improving the query performance. For a join operation, when compared with a query scheme without secondary indexing, our proposed indexing scheme outperforms from a minimum 6.54 {\texttimes} speedup to a maximum 860 {\texttimes} speedup; when compared with a classic secondary indexing scheme implemented on HBase, our indexing scheme outperforms from a minimum 1.20 {\texttimes} speedup to a maximum 8.68 {\texttimes} speedup. Our indexing technique would be a useful reference for other industrial big data practices.",

This paper extends the ACP Methodology into the computer vision field, by proposing the concept and basic framework of Parallel Vision. In this paper, we first review previous works related to Parallel Vision, in terms of synthetic data generation and utilization. We detail the utility of synthetic data for feature analysis, object analysis, scene analysis, and other analyses. Then we propose the basic framework of Parallel Vision, which is composed of an ACP trilogy (artificial scenes, computational experiments, and parallel execution). We also present some in-depth thoughts and perspectives on Parallel Vision.

abstract="This paper proposes a simple terminology for understanding and dealing with two current phenomena; we suggest calling them heavyweight and lightweight IT. Heavyweight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT. The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT should be only loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation.",

abstract="In the late twentieth century, cities like Manchester, seen as the `original, modern' [1] world industrial city, faced serious challenges in terms of how to respond to the massive economic restructuring that was taking place. On the one hand, Manchester needed to respond to the highest rates of unemployment and social exclusion seen for more than 50 years, whilst, at the same time, the city wanted to develop innovative and practical solutions which could bring real economic and social benefits to local people. The impact of even more rapid technological change, referred to as the emerging `information society', which started to impact from the 1980s onwards, exacerbated this dilemma, accelerating the process of restructuring so that within urban areas new economic growth increasingly sat side by side with extremes of poverty, unemployment and other forms of social exclusion. This case study looks at the ways that Manchester, and key players from the city region, including the public sector, business, education and the community sector, responded to this and how those responses over the past 25+ years created new ambitions and aspirations for the city and its citizens. The conclusions focus on the concept of the `Smart City' and Manchester's ideas on creating a more inclusive, creative and sustainable city, including through the imaginative use of digital technologies, applications and services, and a commitment to open innovation and the co-production of new and innovative services.",

That process requires an enabling legal construct, which this essay identifies and explores. Contemporary practices of personal information processing constitute a new type of public domain---a repository of raw materials that are there for the taking and that are framed as inputs to particular types of productive activity. As a legal construct, the biopolitical public domain shapes practices of appropriation and use of personal information in two complementary and interrelated ways. First, it constitutes personal information as available and potentially valuable: as a pool of materials that may be freely appropriated as inputs to economic production. That framing supports the reorganization of sociotechnical activity in ways directed toward extraction and appropriation. Second, the biopolitical public domain constitutes the personal information harvested within networked information environments as raw. That framing creates the backdrop for culturally situated techniques of knowledge production and for the logic that designates those techniques as sites of legal privilege.",

Induction of smart gadgetries, people lifestyle equipped with wearables, and development of IoT has revitalized the feature scale of these applications. The landscape of health applications encountering big data need to be replotted on cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources of handheld devices. With this transformation, the outcome from certain health applications is significant where precise, user-centric, and personalized recommendations mimic like a personal care-giver round the clock. To maximize the services spectrum from these applications over cloud, certain challenges like data privacy and communication cost need serious attention. Following the existing trend together with an ambition to promote and assist users with healthy lifestyle we propose a framework of Health Fog where Fog computing is used as an intermediary layer between the cloud and end users. The design feature of Health Fog successfully reduces the extra communication cost that is usually found high in similar systems. For enhanced and flexible control of data privacy and security, we also introduce the cloud access security broker (CASB) as an integral component of Health Fog where certain polices can be implemented accordingly. The modular framework design of Health Fog is capable of engaging data from multiple resources together with adequate level of security and privacy using existing cryptographic primitives.",

abstract="Academic research into RFID technology has largely neglected ethics. What scarce research was being performed has now dwindled despite having some consumers continue to express their ethical concerns. This article aims at reducing this apparent void by exploring the antecedents that cause the public to react when consumers are targeted by RFID technology. Through the analysis of 11 real RFID implementations used to target consumers, our research indicates that several factors can influence consumer response through the distinct nature of the technology, namely, (1) Customization of communications, (2) Imposition of tag use, (3) Segmentation and targeting, (4) Modified role of the sales representative, (5) Physical distance between the consumer and the tag, and (6) Security of transactions. The article then proposes a construct to determine the risk of raising consumer ethical concerns. The construct of ``Connective Proximity'' and its three components (physical proximity, exposure time, and information proximity) are defined. Our research highlights the need for further studies on the ethical considerations of tagging humans and specifically tracking consumers when performing marketing activities with RFID technology. Our article aims at invigorating research on this topic, which has a lot to contribute to both society and corporations.",

abstract="Cloud computing is a methodology and not a technology. Adaptation of cloud computing services for robotic applications is relatively straightforward while adaptation of underlying ideas will require a new design attitude. Cloud computing is a cost-effective and dynamic business model. Currently cloud robotics is understood as a client server methodology which enables robots utilize resources and services placed at centralized servers. These cloud servers treat robots as any other client computer offering them platform, infrastructure, process or algorithm as a service. HTM5 is an OMG MDA based multi-view meta-model for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. HTM5 encourages design of peer-to-peer service ecosystems based on an open registry and matchmaking mechanism. In peer-to-peer cloud robotics, a robot can trade its hardware, software and functional resources as a service to other robots in the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer trade in such systems may be driven by contracts and relationships between its member agents. This article discusses trade-view model of HTM5 methodology and its use in developing a cloud robotic ecosystem that implements peer-to-peer, contract based economy. The article also presents a case study with experiments that implement distributed artificial intelligence and peer-to-peer service oriented trade on simulated and real robot colonies.",

To contribute to fill this gap, this paper introduces Semantic Events Notifier (SEN), a lightweight prototype of semantic-based and agent-oriented middleware that aims to provide near real-time events notification among all the enabled devices of an AAL system. The idea behind this research work goes in the direction to find scalable technological solution to answer the continued growth of objects connected to the IoT network, in particular, within the domestic environment. SEN enables the involved Smart Objects to cooperate synergistically based on a shared semantic model, thus contributing to support various tailored services that assist elderly users or users with disabilities for a better and healthier life in their preferred living environment. Moreover, a prototype of the platform has been implemented and validated to prove the correctness of the approach. Finally, the evaluation of its quality of service requirements in terms of latency, efficiency, and scalability has been conducted in a real case study by means of a defined benchmark.",

abstract="The emergence of mobile healthcare systems is an important outcome of application of pervasive computing concepts for medical care purposes. These systems provide the facilities and infrastructure required for automatic and ubiquitous sharing of medical information. Healthcare systems have a dynamic structure and configuration, therefore having an architecture is essential for future development of these systems. The need for increased response rate, problem limited storage, accelerated processing and etc. the tendency toward creating a new generation of healthcare system architecture highlight the need for further focus on cloud-based solutions for transfer data and data processing challenges. Integrity and reliability of healthcare systems are of critical importance, as even the slightest error may put the patients' lives in danger; therefore acquiring a behavioral model for these systems and developing the tools required to model their behaviors are of significant importance. The high-level designs may contain some flaws, therefor the system must be fully examined for different scenarios and conditions. This paper presents a software architecture for development of healthcare systems based on pervasive computing concepts, and then models the behavior of described system. A set of solutions are then proposed to improve the design's qualitative characteristics including, availability, interoperability and performance.",

China and the US have adopted converging approaches to address these challenges: inserting e-commerce chapters into their FTAs. However, the substance of these chapters is diverging. Firstly, US FTAs categorise digital products separately from goods and services and provide national treatment and most favoured nation treatment to products and their suppliers. China's FTAs still offer no solutions to the classification of digital products and their treatment. Secondly, although China's FTAs still provide weak protection for consumers and privacy, Chinese domestic law has converged towards US FTAs to provide better protection. Thirdly, US and China FTAs are significantly divergent in their regulation of the free flow of information. In the post-TPP era, a polycentric direction will emerge in the regulation of the free flow of information between China and the US.",

journal="Telecommunication Systems",

month="Jul",
day="25",
abstract="In an Internet of Things environment, where multiple mobile devices are brought together, it is not always possible to serve all these devices simultaneously. We developed an intelligent Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheduler which allows to plan the individual packets of the different streams in such a way that everyone can be served by taking into account the interference on the physical layer. The scheduler is applied in a realistic industrial environment and evaluated based on the maximum link latency, the channel occupancy, and the jitter. Two strategies are compared: one where the packets are sequentially allocated, and one periodically. Our results show that the periodically allocated strategy performs the best for the maximum link latency (for a packet size below 1200 bytes) and for the jitter. The channel occupancy is similar for both strategies. Furthermore, the performance can be improved by using a higher number of channels. Compared to classic Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), the channel occupancy and the jitter are reduced up to 69.9 and 99.9{\%}, respectively. Considering the maximum link latency, the proposed TDMA strategies perform significantly better than the worst case CSMA/CA (up to 99.8{\%}), however, when assuming a best case CSMA/CA scenario, CSMA/CA performs better. Furthermore, we clearly show that there are cases where it is not possible to plan all streams when using CSMA/CA while this becomes feasible when applying the proposed TDMA strategies.",

However, how to measure security degree of Sensitive Information is an open issue. To our best knowledge, no effective method can detect secret trace of SI thieves in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), especially for backdoors and vulnerabilities in software or firmware. To deal with these problems, we propose a new design, called, IIoT-SIDefender (IIoT-SID), we measure security degree of Sensitive Information via Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), based on selected taint tracking and real-time memory modification, attack-defense and fix-distribution approaches are proposed. Until now, it is the first defined SI guard method to detect SI-leakage scenarios and reject SI-leverage attack. To verify our proposal, experimental tests are verified in a large number of IIoT applications and devices, including IP cameras, smart meters, PLCs and smart routers. Test results have demonstrated that we can capture security level for Sensitive Information as expected, detect potential leakage points in data lifetime (including unknown backdoors and vulnerabilities), describe fine-grained semantics of accidental leakage and secret leverage points, and generate relative hot fix to prevent further attack.",

abstract="Involvement in the global innovation system and the level of ICT influence the technological state of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) countries and their position in the world economy. Many studies were inspired that examined these economies from various prospective. However, only a few have specially focused on information and communication technologies (ICT), and particularly in services sectors. This paper aims to contribute to the analysis of the evolution of services ICT systems in BRICS. The main hypothesis of the article is that BRICS has made significant progress in economic cooperation, at the same time, the group has not been equally successful in designing and implementing their own agenda in the technology field. The BRICS are not released at a sufficient level of interaction and advocacy in ICT services, which would increase their role in international trade. The authors observe the retrospective of the process of formation of national innovation systems of the country participants of BRICS, consider current trends and challenges in the development of national markets for these services in each member country, and highlight future directions for the development. Then they provide an analysis of BRICS countries' participation in the international ICT services trade. An estimation of revealed comparative advantage indicators allowed determining the dynamics in comparative advantage for ICT service trade in BRICS. Despite the increase in the volume of export operations in the trade in ICT services, their level of competitiveness is declining. The most vulnerable to the reduction of revealed comparative advantage was India, at the same time Brazil and South Africa showed the least volatile dynamics. It is argued that the policies aimed at promoting investment and enhancing conditions for trade in ICT services contributed significantly to services exports expansion in BRICS. Based on the analysis, a conclusion is made about the current problems and insufficient level of technical cooperation within the group.",

abstract="With this research, an implementation of an overlay and abstracting RESTful API (application programming interface) for 3D printers is proposed to expose these resources to the Internet for utilization within and for cloud services. This is to abstract the underlying communication structure and means for accessing and controlling a 3D printer resource in one of three ways. The first way is a proprietary protocol or a 3D printer driver in Microsoft Windows. The second way is the control via a USB-serial connection between a controlling computer and the printer resource. This protocol can either be in a proprietary format or based on open standards like G-Code (ISO 6983-1:2009). The third way of control is based on physical storage devices attached to the printer with machining instructions stored on them. This research excludes the communication and control means involving proprietary protocols or drivers due complexity restrictions within the implementation. The approach is designed with extensibility in mind so that future access to proprietary protocols can be added to the control API. 3D printer resources with only the third control method available are also excluded from this research due to their lack of remote controllability. This work describes the design and implementation of an abstraction API layer between varying software and hardware components with an extensible architecture for future hardware and software components for within the domain of additive manufacturing (AM). With this research, the connection to further cloud services as 3D printing resources as well as a cloud printing service for usage and control of this API is demonstrated. This enables the use of AM machinery within cloud or business process-oriented architectures as the AM machinery and the associated software are exposed in an abstract and unified way and usable as services.",

We propose an efficient mutual authentication protocol for passive RFID tags that provides confidentiality, untraceability, mutual authentication, and efficiency. The proposed protocol shifts the heavy burden of asymmetric encryption and decryption operations on the more powerful server side and only leaves lightweight hash operation on tag side. It is also efficient in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and communication cost, which are very important for practical large-scale RFID applications.",

abstract="Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing--structure--property--performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.",

abstract="The widespread deployment and utility of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN's) in healthcare systems required new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, that are able to deal with the storage and processing limitations of WBAN's. This amalgamation of WBAN-based healthcare systems to cloud-based healthcare systems gave rise to serious privacy concerns to the sensitive healthcare data. Hence, there is a need for the proactive identification and effective mitigation mechanisms for these patient's data privacy concerns that pose continuous threats to the integrity and stability of the healthcare environment. For this purpose, a systematic literature review has been conducted that presents a clear picture of the privacy concerns of patient's data in cloud-assisted healthcare systems and analyzed the mechanisms that are recently proposed by the research community. The methodology used for conducting the review was based on Kitchenham guidelines. Results from the review show that most of the patient's data privacy techniques do not fully address the privacy concerns and therefore require more efforts. The summary presented in this paper would help in setting research directions for the techniques and mechanisms that are needed to address the patient's data privacy concerns in a balanced and light-weight manner by considering all the aspects and limitations of the cloud-assisted healthcare systems.",

abstract="With the increase of an ageing population and chronic diseases, society becomes more health conscious and patients become ``health consumers'' looking for better health management. People's perception is shifting towards patient-centered, rather than the classical, hospital--centered health services which has been propelling the evolution of telemedicine research from the classic e-Health to m-Health and now is to ubiquitous healthcare (u-Health). It is expected that mobile {\&} ubiquitous Telemedicine, integrated with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), have a great potential in fostering the provision of next-generation u-Health. Despite the recent efforts and achievements, current u-Health proposed solutions still suffer from shortcomings hampering their adoption today. This paper presents a comprehensive review of up-to-date requirements in hardware, communication, and computing for next-generation u-Health systems. It compares new technological and technical trends and discusses how they address expected u-Health requirements. A thorough survey on various worldwide recent system implementations is presented in an attempt to identify shortcomings in state-of-the art solutions. In particular, challenges in WBAN and ubiquitous computing were emphasized. The purpose of this survey is not only to help beginners with a holistic approach toward understanding u-Health systems but also present to researchers new technological trends and design challenges they have to cope with, while designing such systems.",

abstract="The wireless body area networks (WBANs) is a practical application model of Internet of things. It can be used in many scenarios, especially for e-healthcare. The medical data of patients is collected by sensors and transmitted using wireless communication techniques. Different users can access the patient's data with different privileges. Access control is a crucial problem in WBANs. In this paper, we design a new security mechanism named combined public-key scheme in the case of attribute-based (CP-ABES) to address the user access control in WBANs. Our scheme combines encryption and digital signatures. It uses ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to achieve data confidentially, access control, and ciphertext-policy attribute-based signature to realize the identity authentication. The access policy used in our scheme is threshold. Based on this feature, the length of ciphertext and signature of our scheme is constant. Our scheme provides confidentiality, unforgeability, signer privacy and collusion resistance. We prove the efficiency of our scheme theoretically and analyze the security level and energy consumption of our scheme.",

pages="945--968",
abstract="Inductive communication is an emerging physical layer technology for secure communications which has promise to provide significant incentives in body area networks and other short range communication systems. This paper presents the principles and performance of inductive communication systems from the points of view of the efficiencies of the transmitter and receiver topologies. The rapid reduction of power level with distance to power six means that inductive systems should be designed for efficient flux coupling to the receiver. This therefore needs to be quantified. This paper proposes a performance measure using both the trans-impedance and a new factor called the induction factor which describes the magnitude of induced power caused by a transmitter at the receiver. The effects of system parameters on performance are modeled, simulated and discussed. Four system topologies are identified and their performances in terms of the influences of the system components are investigated. Different topologies result to different induced voltages in the receiver. We demonstrate that at frequencies below 1.4 MHz, the performance of the series--series and series--parallel topologies are almost identical. We also show by the induction factor concept that the series--parallel (transmitter--receiver) topology provides more induced voltage to the receiver at high frequencies above 1.4 MHz. This is demonstrated for frequencies up to 4.5 MHz. Many applications use frequencies above 1 MHz, making these results highly essential for inductive system design and development.",

abstract="The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and `silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.",

abstract="Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

abstract="Despite of various benefits such as a convenience and efficiency, home healthcare systems have some inherent security risks that may cause a serious leak on personal health information. This work presents a Secure User Profiling Structure which has the patient information including their health information. A patient and a hospital keep it at that same time, they share the updated data. While they share the data and communicate, the data can be leaked. To solve the security problems, a secure communication channel with a hash function and an One-Time Password between a client and a hospital should be established and to generate an input value to an OTP, it uses a dual hash-function. This work presents a dual hash function-based approach to generate the One-Time Password ensuring a secure communication channel with the secured key. In result, attackers are unable to decrypt the leaked information because of the secured key; in addition, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of computation cost.",

abstract="The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) concept was appeared in the middle of 90s and have been a subject under intensive research in the past few years. Several factors have contributed to this, but the potential for application of WSNs in almost every aspect of day-to-day life is the predominant one. This type of networks has been developed using proprietary solutions instead of standard solutions. More recently, the importance of standards motivated the use of IETF standards in WSNs, making the Internet integration easier. However, more efforts are necessary in order to provide a full integration. The WSNs use mainly IPv6 protocol, but the IPv4 is the predominant one in the Internet. As a consequence, IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms must be provided to allow the interaction between all Internet connected devices independently of the supported IP version. It is also critical to provide a standard application interface to make easier the application development and independently of the hardware platform used. The RESTfull Web services can provide this standard interface. So, combine RESTfull Web services with IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms can increase the WSN services dissemination. The transition mechanisms and the REST Web services are supported in the gateway in order to save the wireless sensor device resources'. The smartphone with Internet connectivity can also be the drive to the WSNs growth, because user-friendly applications can be used to retrieve and collect sensed data. This paper proposes a solution based on REST web services to permit the interaction between a mobile application and the IPv6 compliant WSN.",

abstract="Recently, privacy concerns about data collection have received an increasing amount of attention. In data collection process, a data collector (an agency) assumed that all respondents would be comfortable with submitting their data if the published data was anonymous. We believe that this assumption is not realistic because the increase in privacy concerns causes some respondents to refuse participation or to submit inaccurate data to such agencies. If respondents submit inaccurate data, then the usefulness of the results from analysis of the collected data cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, we note that the level of anonymity (i.e., k-anonymity) guaranteed by an agency cannot be verified by respondents since they generally do not have access to all of the data that is released. Therefore, we introduce the notion of k                                                  i                -anonymity, where k                                                  i                . is the level of anonymity preferred by each respondent i. Instead of placing full trust in an agency, our solution increases respondent confidence by allowing each to decide the preferred level of protection. As such, our protocol ensures that respondents achieve their preferred k                                                  i                -anonymity during data collection and guarantees that the collected records are genuine and useful for data analysis.",

We examine a scenario in which a significant segment of the world's population has a presence in a VRSN. Given the pace of technological development and the popularity of these new forms of social interaction, this scenario is plausible. However, it brings with it ethical problems. Two central ethical issues are addressed: those of privacy and those of autonomy. VRSNs pose threats to both privacy and autonomy. The threats to privacy can be broadly categorized as threats to informational privacy, threats to physical privacy, and threats to associational privacy. Each of these threats is further subdivided. The threats to autonomy can be broadly categorized as threats to freedom, to knowledge and to authenticity. Again, these three threats are divided into subcategories.

abstract="Technical systems have become more and more complicated in recent decades and require more detailed control of their operation. This primarily relates to the safety, reliability, and efficiency of devices used in medicine, electronics, and other fields. Furthermore, with the development of the conception of the Internet of Things, a lot of attention has been paid to the interaction between humans and high-tech equipment and personal devices. Highly detailed information on the operation of a device or complex system can only be given by a large number of small sensors of different types. As we know, the most sophisticated sensory machine is a living organism. Formerly this thought led to the idea of creating a multisensory platform which would mimic the human skin capabilities. Electronic skin can simultaneously monitor many parameters such as temperature, strain, pressure, magnetic field, and intensity of light; it is also possible to emulate tactile and chemical perception. Nanotechnology serves as a tool for the creation of new sensor materials, and the development of printing technologies supports engineering low-cost, thin, lightweight, transparent, easily deformable, and biocompatible (even transient) electronic devices for monitoring external factors and processing information. In this review we discuss the state-of-the-art and prospects of new materials and technologies towards emerging flexible sensors.",

abstract="This Special Issue of the Journal of the Knowledge Economy focuses on how advanced European cities develop strategies towards becoming ``smart cities'', based on the many possible innovative usages of network infrastructures and Internet-based applications, through the engagement of open innovation ecosystems. Part of these strategies is to develop new types of innovation approaches in urban areas, which are characterized, firstly, by a high level of citizen involvement in co-creating Internet-based applications in all sectors of the economy and society; secondly, by the emergence of new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutes, universities, and companies. Such strategies and the resulting ``innovation ecosystems'' are becoming increasingly relevant given the growing economic and social issues and opportunities that cities are currently facing. This special issue investigates these smart city strategies through four smart city case studies and two papers addressing horizontal issues. The case studies aim to analyze the currently emerging strategies and policies related to identify how the opportunities of the Future Internet are being used for the socio-economic development of urban areas. The four cases also address how cities are redefining their innovation structures and how they started to experiment citizens involvement within the context of open innovation, and present lessons learned that are of interest to smart city stakeholders.",

However, it is critical to analyze and evaluate these algorithms to examine their capabilities. This paper provides a thorough investigation of the randomness of ciphertext obtained from Simeck, Kasumi, DES and AES. The design of our randomness analysis is based on five metrics implemented following the guidance of the NIST statistical test suite for cryptographic applications. This analysis also provides performance and power consumption evaluations for the selected cryptographic algorithms using different platforms and measures. Results from the evaluation reveal that lightweight algorithms have competitive randomness levels, lower processing time and lower power consumption when compared to conventional algorithms.",

abstract="A smart home is a home environment enriched with sensing, actuation, communication and computation capabilities which permits to adapt it to inhabitants preferences and requirements. Establishing a proper strategy of actuation on the home environment can require complex computational tasks on the sensed data. This is the case of activity recognition, which consists in retrieving high-level knowledge about what occurs in the home environment and about the behaviour of the inhabitants. The inherent complexity of this application domain asks for tools able to properly support the design and implementation phases. This paper proposes a framework for the design and implementation of smart home applications focused on activity recognition in home environments. The framework mainly relies on the Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE) architecture offering basic abstraction entities which easily allow to design and implement Smart Home applications. CASE is a three layered architecture which exploits the distributed multi-agent paradigm and the cloud technology for offering analytics services. Details about how to implement activity recognition onto the CASE architecture are supplied focusing on the low-level technological issues as well as the algorithms and the methodologies useful for the activity recognition. The effectiveness of the framework is shown through a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of a person in a home environment.",

month="Aug",
day="16",
abstract="Context-aware computing is the ability of Services and applications to adapt and react to context changes. Context modelling is a core feature of context-aware computing. Although a lot of research has been made in the field of context modelling, most of the context-aware computing proposals prefer to design their own customized context model instead of reusing an existing one. The main reason for this behaviour is that current context models present some problems concerning reusability, extensibility and adaptation. To contribute solving these issues, in this paper we present 3LConOnt, a three-level context ontology that can be easily reused, extended and adapted for specific or generic purposes. The proposed context model consolidates the context knowledge already available from a modular perspective yielding a clear schema of knowledge reutilization. To do so, we gathered context knowledge pieces from different ontologies to be integrated into standardized and well-defined levels of abstraction and modules. The proposal has been validated considering: (1) reusability, extensibility and adaptation by instantiating different smart scenarios; (2) consistency and reasoning by triggering queries to the proposed model based on some competence questions; and (3) reusability in existing ontologies by importing the needed module or level of the model. Additionally, we also illustrate its usability in context-aware Services by modelling a context-aware framework architecture for supporting the whole context life cycle: acquisition, modelling, reasoning and distribution.",

abstract="We present a review on the subject of Conductive Bridging Random Access Memory (CBRAM) based on copper- or silver-doped silicon dioxide. CBRAM is a promising type of resistive non-volatile memory which relies on metal ion transport and redox reactions to form a persistent conducting filament in a high resistance film. This effect may be reversed to return the device to a high resistance state. Such control over resistance can be used to represent digital information (e.g., high =0, low =1) or produce multiple discrete or even continuous analog values as required by advanced storage and computing concepts. Many materials have been used in CBRAM devices but we concentrate in this paper on silicon dioxide as the ion conducting layer. The primary benefits of this approach lie with the CMOS process compatibility and the ubiquity of this material in integrated circuits which greatly lower the barrier for widespread usage and permit integration of memory with silicon-based devices. Our discussion covers materials and electrochemical theory, including the role of counter charge in these devices, as well as the current understanding of the nature of the filament growth. Theory of operation is supported by descriptions of physical and electrical analyses of devices, including in-situ microscopy and impedance spectroscopy. We also provide insight into memory arrays and other advanced applications, particularly in neuromorphic computing. The radiation tolerance of these devices is also described.",

abstract="Smart Specialisation has become the catchword for innovation policy approaches to optimally leverage regional dynamism in knowledge creation and application, and thus achieving comparative advantages in a globalised knowledge economy. It can support innovation policies putting the grand societal challenges of the twenty-first century high on the political agenda by intelligently investing the available resources in harnessing unique regional assets (as well as their inter-regional combinations), which were identified and capitalised on by `entrepreneurial discovery' processes. This paper argues that research driven clusters as local nodes of global knowledge flows and as `microcosms' in a complex world of cross-cutting regional and sector innovation systems, provide promising `targets' for strategic policy support fostering smart specialisation. By being integrated in global value chains, and at the same time embedded in their regional innovation systems, higher-order learning and priority-setting processes of (quadruple helix) cluster stakeholders can lead to increased return on public and private investments within and across regions: they enable the application of technological know-how for innovative solutions to address global challenges, and thus help optimise the application of `localised' knowledge capabilities for regional prosperity. Our case study---MicroTEC S{\"u}dwest, a German ``Spitzen'' cluster in the top-ranking, `associational' innovation system of Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg---spans an area of more than five million inhabitants, comparable in size with some countries in Europe. With this, we can exemplify elements of promising Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) outlining the participatory processes implemented to develop better-informed outward-looking (across sectors, borders, etc.), and more forward-looking strategies for evidence-based priority-setting and focusing investments.",

abstract="As an important part of Internet of Things, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system employs low-cost RFID tag to communicate with everything containing animate and inanimate objects. This technology is widely used in the e-healthcare applications. However, the malicious communication environment makes people more and more worried. In order to overcome the hazards in the network, RFID authentication schemes for e-healthcare have been proposed by researchers. But since the computation ability of the tag is relatively weak, it is necessary to put forward a lightweight and secure scheme for medical systems. Moreover, cloud is widely accepted by people and used in many kinds of systems. So we propose a novel and lightweight RFID authentication scheme with cloud for e-healthcare applications. We use an enhanced formal security model to prove the security of our scheme. In this model the channel between the server and the reader is considered to be insecure and informal analysis is used to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Through the formal and informal analysis, our scheme not only resists the common attacks, but also keeps mutual authentication, information integrity, forward untraceability and backward untraceability. Moreover, both the tag and the reader can reach the anonymity. Our scheme is only hash-based and suitable to realize various security requirements. Compared to recent schemes of the same sort, it is more applicable in e-healthcare.",

Primarily the focus is on gait analysis methodologies exploiting average speed, however this presents an issue when used for context aware applications. Additionally data capture tends to be in short bursts over a long period, allowing for localized temporal factors, such as short term injury, to potentially skew measurements. As such this work collects gait and trajectory IoT data from elderly adults in senior homes (``in the wild'') over a sustained period of time (1 year). Density based clustering algorithms are then applied to the data to provide long-term insights into how the high density regions change over time. The data is collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client utilizing available processing resources and delivers the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained from the long-term study, suggesting that this form of evaluation has strong potential in the analysis of cognitive and physical status deterioration.",

However, due to its restrictions on computation ability, storage space and battery capacity, RFID-based IoT system has to confront with various security and efficiency challenges. Recently, a lightweight RFID mutual authentication protocol with cache in the reader is introduced by Fan et al., named LRMAPC. Fan et al.'s LRMAPC can achieve stronger security and privacy requirements and reduce the computation and storage overheads during authentication process. Unfortunately, we discover that Fan et al.'s LRMAPC is susceptible to reader impersonation attack, tag forgery attack and message eavesdropping attack. Besides, it fails to preserve mutual authentication between the reader and the database. In order to remedy these flaws mentioned above, we further present an advanced authentication mechanisms and demonstrate the correctness of the advanced LRMAPC through the Gong-Needham-Yahalom (GNY) logic analysis. Compared the security and efficiency with Fan et al.'s LRMAPC, the advanced LRMAPC satisfies desirable security requirements and maintains acceptable efficiency in terms of the costs of storage space and computation time. As a result, our advanced LRMAPC is a very promising solution for resource-constrained devices in RFID-based IoT systems.",

We propose secure improvements to these protocols to address the vulnerabilities, and improve the scalability of these schemes making them suitable for large-scale deployments.",

abstract="In the big data era, the volume of streaming data produced by sensor networks is staggeringly large that enables business intelligence to make well-informed decisions on emerging modern applications. Performing the data analytics and query processing over the fast arriving data streams is a tedious process. The semantic annotation of the data stream provides a high-level description, and a semantic context supports intelligent querying and data analytics. This paper presents a framework called SEmantic Annotation over Summarized sensOr Data stReam (SEASOR) that includes summarization, semantic annotation, and query processing that facilitates sensor data stream analytics. The summarization merges these types of stream values to increase the query performance and decrease the memory space. The semantic annotation is scripted with the help of application-dependent base ontology that extends the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology. The annotation of the sensor stream provides detailed descriptions for the observation of sensors using the base ontology, and it divides the streaming sensor data into several subsets according to the sensing features. The domain model enables the query processor to access the relevant results via an annotated Resource Description Framework (RDF). The query processor uses the extended SPARQL (Cs-SPARQL) to access only the relatively small subset via an annotated RDF file and allows extending the query processing to support windows and the parallel processing of data streams. The experimental results prove that the proposed SEASOR provides timely answers to the user queries and achieves better performance in terms of result accuracy by 95{\%}.",

abstract="In the Internet of Things (IoT), data-producing entities sense their environment and transmit these observations to a data processing platform for further analysis. Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making. To show the strengths of the platform, two use cases are detailed and thoroughly evaluated.",

abstract="In current times, multimedia application includes integrated sensors, mobile networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services. In IoT services, if more devices are connected without much constrains, the problem of security, trust and privacy remain a challenge. For multimedia communications through Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), sensor nodes transmit confidential data to the gateway nodes via public channels. In such an environment, the security remains a serious issue from past many years. Only few works are available to support secure multimedia communications performed in IoT-enabled WSNs. Among the few works, Kumari and Om recently proposed an authentication protocol for multimedia communications in IoT-enabled WSNs, which is applicable in coal mine for safety monitoring. The authors claimed in their work that their contributory protocol strongly withstands several security threats such as, user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack, sensor node anonymity issue and others technical design issues. However, this article proved that Kumari and Om's protocol has some design flaws and is susceptible to various security attacks including, user and sensor node impersonation attacks. As a remedy, a robust authentication protocol using smartcard is constructed to solve the security issues found in Kumari and Om's protocol. The proof of correctness of mutual authentication is performed using the BAN logic model. In addition, our further security investigation claimed strong protection against known security attacks. Our protocol is analyzed comprehensively and compared against the similar protocols and the results showed that it is efficient and robust than earlier protocols.",

These factors have been conflated and evince the potential of robot-assisted TOE. Hence, a careful integration of clinical experience and Systems Engineering methods was used to develop a concept and physical model for TOE manipulation.

In a CMfg system, in view of the trust issue in resource service transactions, this paper extends the trust evaluation model in the existing related research and proposes a new method and model. In order to make the final trust evaluation values more practical, the proposed method introduces the third-party trust evaluation model based on existing direct and indirect (recommended) trust evaluation models as well as the time decay factor. It also quantifies the fuzzy indexes by using intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). Thereby, the trust evaluation model increases the credibility of service transaction trust evaluation in a CMfg system.",

One crucial problem in cloud is the cloud data processing result may be incorrect, thus cannot be fully trusted. This calls for research to verify the correctness of data processing at the cloud in order to enhance its trustworthiness, especially for encrypted data processing. At present, various cryptosystems have been proposed to achieve verifiability with different characteristics and quality.

abstract="In this paper, we proposed an secure IoT framework to ensure an End-To-End security from an IoT application to IoT devices. The proposed IoT framework consists of the IoT application, an IoT broker and the IoT devices. The IoT devices can be deployed along a board line or a boundary of the area of IoT broker. The IoT broker manages their own devices and aggregates their sensing data. The IoT application provides users with IoT services. To use the IoT services, it needs to access to sensing data. Especially, the case of real-time healthcare services should consider intermediate security issues because medical information of patients is one of very sensitive privacy information. However, most of IoT protocols such as CoAP and MQTT have no concern about the End-To-End security, they only depended on the security of DTLS. Therefore, we proposed a new IoT framework to satisfy the End-To-End security feature under the CoAP communication. The proposed framework encrypts sensitive data by a symmetric encryption and an attribute-based encryption for efficiencies of communication and computation costs. In addition, each IoT device has a unique identification used as one of their attributes. Consequently, although the IoT broker is one of the intermediate nodes, it decrypts and shows data only if it satisfies all attributes.",

abstract="Information systems are very crucial in today's organizations, and hence the selection of the right system has become a very critical decision. As time has progressed, with new issues affecting the supply chain and the performance metrics being continually rewritten, the responsibility of the information systems has increased manifold. Nowadays, information systems are expected to perform a number of functions such as information security, big data handling, green supply chain and risk management and thus the basic problem of system selection is now more complex. Also, adding to the complexity is the fact that these new issues are interdependent and most of the times influence other issues in a variety of direct or indirect ways. This study addresses this problem by proposing a new model for information system selection by incorporating the latest trends in the supply chain. It also proposes an integrated methodology, to solve such a problem where interdependence between criteria exists. The advantages of this methodology over other existing techniques are delinking the evaluation of interdependent criteria weights from performance evaluation, flexibility of inputs, ability to handle vagueness and uncertainty in judgements. The methodology is illustrated using a numerical example.",

abstract="Everyday more and more ubiquitous applications are developed to support aging in place and ambient assisted living. Although these technologies typically adhere to the functional requirements defined by their developers, many of these solutions evidence limitations for being adopted by end-users, i.e., older adults. This paper reports the authors' experience in the design and deployment of several iterations of the SocialConnector system---a computer-supported family communication mediator---as a case study that helps identify key factors that ease the adoption of ambient intelligent systems encouraging intergenerational family communication at home. The particularity of the followed approach is to assemble widely available mass-market technology---such as commercial Tablet PCs and TV displays---glued together with innovative software, as a way to drive system adoption through economically affordable hardware running over empirically-driven considerations for designing effective software in this study domain. The case study results help researchers and practitioners to conceive technology that has a better chance of being embraced by older adults and their supporting family networks; particularly, when such a technology is going to be deployed in their homes. Therefore, the key design factors identified in this paper can be used to inform the conception and modeling of ambient intelligent systems that help older adults address several aspects of their aging in place process, like health monitoring, personal security, social engagement, support to daily activities, and ultimately, fostering wellbeing.",

Using such models it is possible to define strategies for optimizing the day-to-day energy consumption of buildings. To verify the feasibility of this proposal, we apply our approach to a reference building for which we have contextual data from a complete year of monitoring. First, we characterize the building in terms of its contextual features and energy consumption, and then select the most appropriate techniques to generate the most accurate model of our reference building charged with estimating the energy consumption, given a concrete set of inputs. Finally, considering the energy usage profile of the building, we propose specific control actions and strategies to save energy.",

This paper looks at these challenges with a view towards revolutionizing current learning environments to smart learning environments and provides new suggestions for technological solutions. Furthermore, this paper argues for a transformation from the current learning environments to smart learning environments. This is to be achieved by reengineering the fundamental structure and operations of current educational systems to better integrate these new technologies with the required pedagogical shift.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is a latest concept of machine-to-machine communication, that also gave birth to several information security problems. Many traditional software solutions fail to address these security issues such as trustworthiness of remote entities. Remote attestation is a technique given by  Trusted Computing Group (TCG) to monitor and verify this trustworthiness. In this regard, various remote validation methods have been proposed. However, static techniques cannot provide resistance to recent attacks e.g. the latest Heartbleed bug, and the recent high profile glibc attack on Linux operating system. In this research, we have designed and implemented a lightweight Linux kernel security module for IoT devices that is  scalable enough to monitor multiple applications in the kernel space. The newly built technique can measure and report multiple application's static and dynamic behavior simultaneously. Verification of behavior of applications is performed via machine learning techniques. The result shows that deviating behavior can be detected successfully by the verifier.",

abstract="Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) are still in their early stage of development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios and applications is tremendous. That range is extended by its inclusion in Internet with IPv6 Low-Power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs). This makes it obvious that multi-technology topologies, security and mobility support will be prevalent in 6LoWPAN. Mobility based communication increases the connectivity, and allows extending and adapting LoWPANs to changes in their location and environment infrastructure. However, the required mobility is heavily dependent on the individual service scenario and the LoWPAN architecture. In this context, an optimized solution is proposed for critical applications, such as military, fire rescue or healthcare, where people need to frequently change their position. Our scenario is health monitoring in an oil refinery where many obstacles have been found to the effective use of LoWPANs in these scenarios, mainly due to transmission medium features i.e. high losses, high latency and low reliability. Therefore, it is very difficult to provide continuous health monitoring with such stringent requirements on mobility. In this paper, a paradigm is proposed for mobility over 6LoWPAN for critical environments. On the one hand the intra-mobility is supported by GinMAC, which is an extension of IEEE 802.15.4 to support a topology control algorithm, which offers intra-mobility transparently, and Movement Direction Determination (MDD) of the Mobile Node (MN). On the other hand, the inter-mobility is based on pre-set-up of the network parameters in the visited networks, such as Care of Address and channel, to reach a fast and smooth handoff. Pre-set-up is reached since MDD allows discovering the next 6LoWPAN network towards which MN is moving. The proposed approach has been simulated, prototyped, evaluated, and is being studied in a scenario of wearable physiological monitoring in hazardous industrial areas, specifically oil refineries, in the scope of the GinSeng European project.",

Multiple IoT applications have been evolved since recent past. Low power consumption, accuracy of transmission and robustness takes the center stage in developing these applications. IEEE 802.15.4 is a low power protocol for low range low data rate scenario. In this paper, we propose a minimal error modified IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver for IoT applications in health care. The health-care scenario, due to its critical nature, calls for an error free communication. We propose a modified frequency offset estimator which performs better in terms of error variance than the existing estimators for IEEE 802.15.4. The simulation result shows that the bit error rate and packet error rate performance of the proposed transceiver are significantly improved compared to the standard architecture. The proposed transceiver reduces the power consumption due to less number of retransmission per packet for successful transmission of the packet.",

abstract="Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has emerged as a solution for the wireless interface between medical sensors and personal servers in future telemedicine systems. The WiMedia Alliance has specified a distributed medium access control protocol based on UWB for high-rate WPANs. In the cases of some applications, data traffic between the source device and destination device is transmitted via one or more intermediate links before it reaches the destination device. However, when all data frames do not transmit in the current DRP reservation block, a relay device cannot transmit the received data frame from the source device in the current DRP policy, until the next DRP duration reserved for forwarding to the destination device begins. This policy increases end-to-end latency between the source device and destination device significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel reservation-based routing protocol to minimize the end-to-end delay between source and destination. The proposed routing protocol utilizes the number of medium access slots and hop-count to decide the optimal route between the source device and destination device. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol can enhance the throughput and delay performance and improve energy efficiency by minimizing the packet drop and collision.",

abstract="In recent years, wireless medical sensor networks meet the web to enable exciting healthcare applications that require data communication over the Internet. Often these applications suffer from data disclosure due to malicious users' activities. To prevent such data disclosure in the healthcare systems, many public key cryptographic techniques have been used. However, most of them are too expensive to implement in the web-enabled wireless medical sensor networks. In 2013, Xun et al. introduced a lightweight encryption algorithm to protect communication between the sensor node and the data servers. Their scheme is based on the Sharemind framework. However, Sharemind framework has a limitation on the number of data storage servers (ie., three servers only). In addition, Xun et al's scheme does not support privacy-preserving patient data analysis for distributed databases of different hospitals. In this paper, we introduce a new practical approach to prevent data disclosure from inside attack. Our new proposal is based on FairplayMP framework which enables programmers who are not experts in the theory of secure computation to implement such protocols. In addition, it support any number of n participants and is suitable for distributed environments. Moreover, in our new scheme, each sensor node needs only one secret key stored in advance to communicate with n different data servers, whereas three secret keys are embedded in advance into each sensor in order to communicate with three data servers in Xun et al's scheme.",

Authentication and key agreement protocols are developed to ensure confidentiality and security in IOT. We design a biometric based authentication and key agreement protocol for WSNs. To analyze the security of the proposed protocol, we use formal security proof, which shows that an attacker has a negligible probability of breaking the protocol security. We also use the BAN logic technique to show the correctness of mutual authentication. Additionally, we adopt an informal analysis to discuss the resistance of proposed scheme against various possible attacks on authentication protocols. Additionally, through the comparison of computational efficiency and security attributes with recent results, proposed protocol seems to be more appropriate for WSNs.",

abstract="Real-time manufacturing data plays more and more important roles in today's competitive manufacturing industry; however, many enterprises are still troubled by the lack of this timely, accurate, and consistent manufacturing data as there are no effective data collecting and process methods. The hysteretic and unmatched information flows lead to great opacity and uncertainty for production management. This paper thereby proposes a comprehensive real-time data-driven monitoring method in job-shop floor based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to address these issues. Firstly, a RFID configuration strategy is put forward including both RFID tag and device configuration schemas. The essence of RFID applications in job-shop floor is revealed too. Next, different levels of data collecting and monitoring models are established one by one, from single RFID reader level to process and process flow levels, wherein different types of state blocks are deployed to a decomposed process/process flow, generating a series of continuous event-driven data collecting units (EDCUs), which not only specify how to collect real-time on-site data but also point out what data should be collected. Then, three data processing methods are presented for different situations such as data preprocessing, fusion, and exception handling. Finally, a use case of a typical part is studied based on a prototype system which demonstrates how to use the proposed models and methods to monitor the production process of the part in job-shop floor and shows their feasibility simultaneously.",

abstract="Clint--server based communication mechanism provides climbable environment for online services, where a user can obtain several services at any time and from anywhere via Internet. As Internet is an insecure communication medium, to achieve security and accountability in data transmission, authentication and key agreement protocols are being adopted. Majority of the existing protocols for mutual authentication are designed for single-server environment, which do not present scalable solution for multi-server environment as multiple registrations are required to perform by the user. Additionally, user must maintain multiple secret keys to access multiple application servers. On the contrary, multi-server authentication (MSA) mechanism presents a user-friendly solution to multiple-registration problem. Unfortunately, many MAS schemes consider trusted server environment, whereas some server may be semi-trusted. To address this issue, Kalra and Sood recently proposed MAS scheme, where all servers need not be entrusted. Kalra and Sood's scheme is feasible for semi-trusted environment. By seeing its importance, we have thoroughly analyzed its security. Unfortunately, we have identified some security flaws in their scheme. Our aim is to overcome the flaws of Kalra and Sood's scheme, and present privacy protected mutual authentication mechanism for multi-server communication. In this paper, we first pointed out the security failures of Kalra and Sood's scheme and then proposed an improved MSA scheme to fix those vulnerabilities of existing MSA schemes. Our design is suitable for semi-trusted environment and protects anonymity. Moreover, the performance of the proposed protocol is comparable with the existing protocols.",

abstract="In conventional cloud computing technology, cloud resources are provided centrally by large data centers. For the exponential growth of cloud users, some applications, such as health monitoring and emergency response with the requirements of real-time and low-latency, cannot achieve efficient resource support. Therefore, fog computing technology has been proposed, where cloud services can be extended to the edge of the network to decrease the network congestion. In fog computing, the idle resources within many distributed devices can be used for providing services. An effective resource scheduling scheme is important to realize a reasonable management for these heterogeneous resources. Therefore, in this paper, a two-level resource scheduling model is proposed. In addition, we design a resource scheduling scheme among fog nodes in the same fog cluster based on the theory of the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which considers the diversity of different devices. MATLAB simulation results show that our scheme can reduce the service latency and improve the stability of the task execution effectively.",

In this paper, we trace the origin and evolution of the fabless model through a mixed-method approach, utilizing historic milestones, events, and financial data of publicly-traded semiconductor firms. We have applied theories of institutional entrepreneurship and adaptive ecosystem to identify four stages in this history: differentiation, mobilization, legitimization, and symbiosis to conceptualize the fabless model's co-creation and co-evolution. Our findings indicate that actions of institutional entrepreneurs within specific temporal locations and structures played a crucial role in the fabless business model's origin and co-evolution.",

abstract="Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals often consist of unwanted noises and speckles. In order to remove the noises, various image processing filters are used in various studies. In this paper, FIR and IIR filters are initially used to remove the linear and nonlinear delay present in the input ECG signal. In addition, filters are used to remove unwanted frequency components from the input ECG signal. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the features present in the input ECG signal. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is widely used for pattern recognition. However, traditional SVM method does not applicable to compute different characteristics of the features of data sets. In this paper, we use SVM model with a weighted kernel function method to classify more features from the input ECG signal. SVM model with a weighted kernel function method is significantly identifies the Q wave, R wave and S wave in the input ECG signal to classify the heartbeat level such as Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) and Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs). The performance of the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is comparatively analyzed with other machine learning approaches such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with multilayer perceptron (MLP), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM). The calculated RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R2 and Q2 for the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is low when compared with other approaches such as LDA with MLP, and PCA with SVM and LDA with SVM. Finally, Sensitivity, Specificity and Mean Square Error (MSE) are calculated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with an enhanced kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.",

abstract="Electrocardiogram (ECG) as one of the best methods to measure irregular heartbeats is a dispensable method for doctor to diagnose Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients. Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of Door to Balloon (D2B) time, which is defined as the time interval starting when an Acute--Myocardial-Infarction patient arrives at the Emergency Department, and ending when a catheter guide wire crosses the culprit lesion as the acute-myocardial-infarction treatment on the patient in the cardiac catheterization room. Generally, when a patient with acute-chest pain is sent into a hospital (always to Emergency Department), the hospital will collect his/her ECG which needs to be evaluated by a cardiologist to ensure that the patient really has Acute Myocardial Infarction. Then the medical workers deliver the patient to the cardiac catheterization room to operate balloon angioplasty. In previous years, the cardiologist must utilize a PC to connect to the Intranet of the hospital and employ a special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can check the patient's ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since the doctor may stay outdoors and he/she needs some time to find a PC and network. Of course, if the PC has not installed the PACS image browser, the doctor has to download and install it. Consequently, the D2B time should be worsened, thus possibly impacting the patient's life. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a Cloud-based Electrocardiogram System, with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG so as to shorten the D2B time. This system has been online in a medical center in middle Taiwan for more than one year. The shortened D2B time is longer than 10 min, i.e., receiving fine results.",

Third, we retrieve similar lung nodule images with the presented adaptive-weighted similarity calculation method. Finally, we recognize nodule signs from the retrieval results, which can also provide decision support for diagnosis of lung lesions. The proposed method is validated on the publicly available databases: lung image database consortium and image database resource initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and lung computed tomography (CT) imaging signs (LISS). The experimental results demonstrate our retrieval method substantially improves retrieval performance compared with those using traditional Hamming distance, and the retrieval precision can achieve 87.29{\%} when the length of hash code is 48 bits. The entire recognition rate on the basis of the retrieval results can achieve 93.52{\%}. Moreover, our method is also effective for real-life diagnosis data.",

Co--Cr--Mo is known to be a difficult to cut material which, due to a combination of mechanical and physical properties, is used for the critical structural components of implantable medical prosthetics. We run a designed experiment which enables us to estimate tool wear from feed rate and cutting speed, and constrain them using a Bayesian hierarchical Gaussian process model which enables prediction of tool wear rates for untried experimental settings. The predicted tool wear rates are non-linear and, using our models, we can identify experimental settings which optimise the life of the tool.

month="Jan",
day="25",
abstract="Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a key technology trend in emerging internet of things paradigms which are commonly used for application areas such as smart-cities, smart-grids, wearables, and connected health. There is a wealth of literature which considers various cluster-based routing protocols such as LEACH, HEED, and UHEED where these protocols are compared in terms of the network lifetime and/or the total number of packets successfully received by the base station under various operational conditions. While existing studies present various approaches to form WSN clusters in the most efficient way, various parameters are manually-assigned their values such as the radius of the cluster, the number of nodes in the cluster, and the number of clusters that should be formed to reach the base station. The choice of correct parameters is essential for reaching the most efficient configuration, however existing studies do not specify a systematic way for tuning these parameters. In other words, the optimization of cluster-based WSNs through fine tuning of related system parameters is not considered in the existing studies. We believe that presenting a generic approach to tune the parameters of clustering algorithms in order to optimize the performance metrics of WSNs is a significant contribution. In this study a systematic and an efficient method is presented to tune the parameters of clustering and routing protocols. Instead of brute force, or trial and error approaches, simulated annealing and K-beams algorithms are adopted together with discrete event system simulator OMNET++ with Castalia Framework. Results are presented comparatively with brute force approach in order to show the efficiency of the new approach in finding the optimum configuration in terms of energy efficiency as well as the rate of successfully received packets.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks have recently been extensively researched due to the flexibility and cost savings they provide. One of the most promising applications of sensor networks is human health monitoring: wireless sensors are placed on the human body to form a wireless body network where the sensor node can continuously monitor real-time physiological parameters or human activities (motion detection). However, along with the flexibility, many problems arise due to a number of factors, including the bad quality of transmission media and the scarcity of resources. Moreover, sensor networks have different characteristics such as a variety of devices, different generated data, etc. From a quality of service (QoS) point of view, the healthcare domain can be seen as a real-time application demand to consider application requirements. Healthcare domains principally have stringent delay and loss requirements. Thus, considering different capabilities and ensuring time data delivery become necessary. Because wireless body area networks (WBAN) deal with human life, any delayed or lost data can endanger the user's life. This paper proposes a differentiated traffic and scheduling scheme for WBAN. It is based on patients' data classification and prioritization according to their current status and diseases. Through queue scheduling and path choice issues, the urgent data are delivered on time to provide a QoS guarantee for WBAN. Finally, it is shown that the proposed scheme is efficient for timely data transfer in WBAN.",

In addition, these solutions can potentially reduce the cost of providing healthcare in the context of the increasing demands of the aging populations in advanced economies. These solutions can also play an important part in intelligent environments, facilitating real-time data collection and input to enable various functionalities. However, there are several challenges regarding the development of mHealth solutions: the most important of these being privacy and data security. Furthermore, the use of cloud computing is becoming an option for the healthcare sector to store healthcare data; but storing data in the cloud raises serious concerns. This paper investigates how data are managed both on mHealth devices as well as in the cloud. Firstly, a detailed analysis of the entire mHealth domain is undertaken to determine domain-specific features and a taxonomy for mHealth, from which a set of security requirements are identified in order to develop a new information security framework. It then examines individual information security frameworks for mHealth devices and the cloud, noting similarities and differences. Furthermore, key mechanisms to implement the new framework are discussed and the new framework is then presented. Finally, the paper presents how the new framework could be implemented in order to develop an Advanced Digital Medical Platform.",

abstract="To address the incomplete problem in pulmonary parenchyma segmentation based on the traditional methods, a novel automated segmentation method based on an eight-neighbor region growing algorithm with left-right scanning and four-corner rotating and scanning is proposed in this paper. The proposed method consists of four main stages: image binarization, rough segmentation of lung, image denoising and lung contour refining. First, the binarization of images is done and the regions of interest are extracted. After that, the rough segmentation of lung is performed through a general region growing method. Then the improved eight-neighbor region growing is used to remove noise for the upper, middle, and bottom region of lung. Finally, corrosion and expansion operations are utilized to smooth the lung boundary. The proposed method was validated on chest positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) data of 30 cases from a hospital in Shanxi, China. Experimental results show that our method can achieve an average volume overlap ratio of 96.21 {\textpm} 0.39{\%} with the manual segmentation results.

abstract="The wireless body sensor network (BSN) is used to detect and transmit physiological data such as vital signs by using radio wave communication. It offers a large saving potential for future healthcare applications because hospitalization of patients with chronic diseases can be kept at a minimum. The radio wave communication on the human body is impacted by the dielectric properties, the posture, and the movement of the body. Under these conditions a highly dynamic link-state and link quality are observed. In this paper we present a study of the link layer behavior of wireless BSNs operating at 2.45 GHz. We report on a wearable body-centric network operation in realistic environments from which we characterize the wireless channels based on a novel test framework. Our test framework uses a 200 ms time resolution for sampling of the wireless links between on-body sensor nodes. We record the received signal strength indicator and link quality indicator values as well as the packet delivery statistics in real-time. Based on recorded experiments we quantify the potential packet delivery performance and energy gain that can be obtained by using dynamic routing and adaptive transmission power schemes, respectively. Subsequently we formulate a set of requirements for the next revision of our prototype wireless BSN developed at Aarhus University School of Engineering in Denmark.",

abstract="The image feature detection is widely used in image registration, image stitching and object recognition. The feature detection algorithm can be applied to the detection of artificial images, and can be used to detect the energy spectrum CT image. A new algorithm of phase consistency detection based on dimensionality reduction is proposed in this paper. We mainly focus on the phase congruency of the spectral CT images in the paper and try to use dimensionality reduction to integrate the information of phase congruency detected in the image. The experimental results show that the algorithm can detect the energy spectrum CT image with clear edge and contour, which is beneficial to the subsequent processing. Meanwhile, the algorithm presented is more effective in diagnosis of disease for medical professionals.",

The AGE@HOME platform is intended to detect unusual activity or inactivity in a home, and is designed to alert caregivers and public health service providers of critical environmental situations in the home (for instance, abnormally high temperature) or unusual behavioural patterns (for instance, the prolonged stillness of a resident). The platform taps into the potential of combining automatic data capture, identification, and sensor technology in order to create a simple and non-intrusive care system. The article presents the decision logic that forms the basis of the system, before describing the software program and graphical user interfaces that were developed based on that logic. A random simulation of the software was run, confirming the decision logic as initially conceived. The simulation also verified that the software could be used in a real-life scenario, in which physical sensors provide data in real-time to the central controller.",

abstract="Cohort Study Platforms (CSP) are emerging as a key tool for collecting patient information, providing new research data, and supporting family and patient associations. However they pose new ethics and regulatory challenges since they cross the gap between patients and medical practitioners. One of the critical issues for CSP is to enforce a strict control on access privileges whilst allowing the users to take advantage of the breadth of the available data. We propose Cerberus, a new access control scheme spanning the whole life-cycle of access right management: design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, operations. Cerberus enables switching from a dual world, where CSP data can be accessed either from the users who entered it or fully de-identified, to an access-when-required world, where patients, practitioners and researchers can access focused medical data through explicit authorisation by the data owner. Efficient access control requires application-specific access rights, as well as the ability to restrict these rights when they are not used. Cerberus is implemented and evaluated in the context of the GENIDA project, an international CSP for Genetically determined Intellectual Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorders. As a result of this study, the software is made available for the community, and validated specifications for CSPs are given.",

abstract="In the present society, most families are double-income families, and as the long-term care is seriously short of manpower, it contributes to the rapid development of tele-homecare equipment, and the smart home care system gradually emerges, which assists the elderly or patients with chronic diseases in daily life. This study aims at interaction between persons under care and the system in various living spaces, as based on motion-sensing interaction, and the context-aware smart home care system is proposed. The system stores the required contexts in knowledge ontology, including the physiological information and environmental information of the person under care, as the database of decision. The motion-sensing device enables the person under care to interact with the system through gestures. By the inference mechanism of fuzzy theory, the system can offer advice and rapidly execute service, thus, implementing the EHA. In addition, the system is integrated with the functions of smart phone, tablet PC, and PC, in order that users can implement remote operation and share information regarding the person under care. The health care system constructed in this study enables the decision making system to probe into the health risk of each person under care; then, from the view of preventive medicine, and through a composing system and simulation experimentation, tracks the physiological trend of the person under care, and provides early warning service, thus, promoting smart home care.",

day="01",
volume="78",
number="6",
pages="921--934",
abstract="This article examines a medical biotechnology known as a wireless body area network (WBAN) as a way to discuss how electronic information infrastructure is spatially extending human bodies into physical landscapes. The term extensible body is introduced, framed by the object-oriented philosophy of Graham Harman. WBANs are sensors placed on or inside of the human body to measure, record, and transmit data about the biological processes of a medical patient. I argue that these body-data should be considered components of bodies themselves, not representations of them. Further, I argue that the geographical discourse on relationality should be less about object relations and more about object extensions. Harman's explication of the ``quadruple object,'' and specifically his use of real and sensual objects makes this possible. This questions the spatial beginnings and ends of categorical objects such as bodies and information, the implications of which could have profound impacts on how policies are framed in sectors such as public health, environment, planning, and medicine. The notion of extensibility is crucial in theorizing how, and where, the Geoweb exists as a spatial-technical assemblage of objects and information. The case of WBANs shows that a theorization of the Geoweb must include the built infrastructure of data storage as a spatial extension of being human.",

So, for a particular time period, it is very tough to find the appropriate data for its certainty. In this paper, all received sensor data are to be assumed as fuzzy numbers, and such assumption could be beneficial to improve the functionality of data availability and accessibility in service-oriented architecture (SOA) system. Whenever any service is requested for updated sensor data, it must be handled through well-defined architecture, and this is governed by enterprise service bus (ESB). This ESB extends the features for SOA as well as strengthen the service middleware architecture. Sensor data received through this ESB would need corrections and cleanliness which could be done through fuzzy theory and help in reducing the uncertainty in data.",

The use of multi agent systems in health care domain has also opened the ways to find out new applications like personalized and socialized health care systems. This versatile use of multi agent systems has also posed new problems for researchers like; security, communication, and different social issues. This work reviews recent years' research and applications of multi agent systems in healthcare published in different research journals, international conferences, and implemented practically. We reviewed five subdomains and three systems in each subdomain. A set of common parameters of these systems has been extracted and compared to analyze systems' merits and deficiencies. Based on our analysis, we have provided recommendations for multi agent systems applied in healthcare domain. Future research directions for interested researchers and practitioners are also discussed. As our own future research work, we intend to study healthcare and multi agent systems in e-commerce.",

abstract="Continuous range queries (CRQs) for moving objects monitor the designated spatial regions and report their up-to-date query results. In such queries, query regions are more static than when compared to moving objects. Therefore, creating an index structure for query regions to process CRQs requires lower maintenance cost of the server than that of moving objects. To relieve the workload of the server, each moving object can be assigned with a resident domain where the object monitors the overlapped query regions and informs the server if any update occurs. In this paper, we propose a grid-based indexing with expansion of resident domains for monitoring CRQs in the mobile/ubiquitous computing environments. The proposed method expands resident domains for moving objects as large as possible so that they have less chance to inform the server about updates. Comprehensive experiments with various settings have verified that our proposed method outperforms the QR*-tree.",

abstract="Among the extensive and impressive collection of applications enabled by IoT, smart and interactive healthcare is a particularly important one. To gather rich information indicator of our mental and physical health, IoT based sensors are either worn on the body or embedded in the living environment. Moreover, by incorporating the mobile computing technology in IoT based healthcare systems, the reactive care system can be transformed to proactive and preventive healthcare systems. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT based smart student m-healthcare monitoring framework is proposed. This framework computes the student diseases severity by predicting the potential disease with its level by temporally mining the health measurements collected from medical and other IoT devices. To effectively analyze the student healthcare data, an architectural model for smart student health care system has been designed. In our case study, health dataset of 182 suspected students are simulated to generate relevant waterborne diseses cases. This data is further analyzed to validate our model by using k-cross validation approach. Pattern based diagnosis scheme is applied using various classification algorithms and then results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and response time. Experimental results show that Decision tree (C4.5) and k-neighest neighbour algorithms perform better as compared to other classifiers in terms of above mentioned parameters. Moreover, the proposed methodology is effective in decision making by delivering time sensitive information to caretaker or doctor within specific time. Lastly, the temporal granule pattern based presentation reterives effective diagnosis results for the proposed system.",

The proposed mechanism rolls omnidirectionally via four tetrahedrally-located pendulums that shift the robot's center of mass to create rolling torque. The nine dynamic equations of motion are derived via the Lagrangian and nonholonomic constraint equations, and then simulated numerically; results show successful propulsion with expected behaviors. The mechanism is then compared to existing center-of-mass designs in terms of directionality, drive torque arm, and inertia eccentricity. In these regards, the four-pendulum design is a balance of existing designs: it is omnidirectional with eccentricity and torque capability that are in the middle of the range exhibited by existing designs. In addition, the new four-pendulum mechanism has been built and tested as a successful proof-of-concept prototype.",

abstract="This paper undertakes a comparative legal study to analyze the challenges of privacy and personal data protection posed by Artificial Intelligence (``AI'') embedded in Robots, and to offer policy suggestions. After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (``PbD'') originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the ``context'' should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the ``algorithmic black box'' or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination. If AI surpasses human intelligence, a terminating function, such as a ``kill switch'' will be the last resort to preserve individual choice. Despite numerous difficulties, we must prepare for the coming AI-prevalent society by taking a flexible approach.",

The SmPHR was developed for Android 4.0.3, and implemented according to the optimized standard protocol for each interface of healthcare services adopted by the Continua Health Alliance (CHA). That is, the Personal Area Network (PAN) interface between the application and PHD implements ISO/IEEE 11073-20,601, 10,404, 10,407, 10,415, 10,417, and Bluetooth Health Device Profile (HDP), and EMRs with a wide area network (WAN) interface implement HL7 V2.6; the Health Record Network (HRN) interface implements Continuity of Care Document (CCD) and Continuity of Care Record (CCR). Also, for SmPHR, we evaluated the transmission error rate between the interface using four PHDs and personal health record systems (PHRs) from previous research, with 611 users and elderly people after receiving institutional review board (IRB) approval. In the evaluation, the PAN interface showed 15 (2.4 {\%}) errors, and the WAN and HRN interface showed 13 (2.1 {\%}) errors in a total of 611 transmission attempts. Also, we received opinions regarding SmPHR from 15 healthcare professionals who took part in the clinical trial. Thus, SmPHR can be provided as an interconnected PHR mobile health service to patients, allowing `plug and play' of PHDs and EMRs through various standard protocols.",

abstract="We study the potential of cognition and cooperation in Body Area Networks (BANs). On one hand, most BAN-based applications involve end-to-end transmission across heterogenous networks. Cognitive communication has been known to be an effective technology for addressing network heterogeneity. On the other hand, a BAN is normally required to provide reliable communications and operate in a very low power level to conserve energy and reduce the electromagnetic radiation impact on human body. Cooperative communication has been known to enhance the transmission reliability and maintain low transmission power. However, the joint cognitive and cooperative mechanism has not been investigated yet in the literature. In this paper, we propose a network architecture for cognitive and cooperative communications in BANs. An intelligent mobile device is introduced as either a cognitive gateway to interconnect heterogenous networks; or a cooperative relay node to achieve transmission diversity. Two cooperative transmission schemes, Energy-conserved Cooperative Transmission and Reliability-driven Cooperative Transmission, are presented for different applications that have distinct energy consumption or reliability requirement. Optimization problems are formulated to optimally allocate power in the cooperative transmission. Results indicate that cooperative transmission schemes can significantly decrease Bit Error Rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption, compared to the non-cooperative schemes. The BER gain is over one order in the high SNR region, while the energy consumption can save up to 50{\%} in the low BER region.",

The sensor nodes along with the data, while in transit, must be protected from malicious attackers. Though using public key cryptographic schemes like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography would provide sufficient security. Their use has been limited owing to their computationally intensive operations which conflict with the resource limitations in wireless sensor nodes. Key pre-distribution has proved to be the most feasible amongst key management schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Research in key management continues to take center stage due to its importance amongst security primitives in WSNs.

abstract="Due to the technological advancement in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), sensor node mobility becomes a basic requirement for many extensive applications. Routing protocol designed for LLNs must ensure real-time data transmission with minimum power consumption. However, the existing mobility support protocols cannot work efficiently in LLNs as they are unable to adapt to the change in the network topology quickly. Therefore, we propose an Enhanced Routing Protocol for LLNs (ERPL), which updates the Preferred Parent (PP) of the Mobile Node (MN) quickly whenever the MN moves away from the already selected PP. Further, a new objective function that takes the mobility of the node into an account while selecting a PP is proposed. Performance of the ERPL has been evaluated with the varying system and traffic parameters under different topologies similar to most of the real-life networks. The simulation results showed that the proposed ERPL reduced the power consumption, packet overhead, latency and increased the packet delivery ratio as compared to other existing works.",

abstract="The replenishment of resource management problem is tough and necessary in RFID system, which requires tags to report the existing information uninterruptedly for guaranteeing goods supply. However, the random or synchronous reply may lead to collision, further, make the system low efficiency. Based on the fusion method between orthogonal code compiling category ID and analogy principle, we present the collision tolerance protocol UACP to identify tags efficiently, which contains UCOM and ACAM mechanisms. UCOM relies on orthogonal signals' correlation to realize the tolerance and accurate category identification by making a comparison between the collision and the whole elements. ACAM depends on the analogy principle to estimate the existing number from microcosmic to macrocosmic only using the singleton slots, and the tags can transmit one-bit affirming message after a series of ACK commands. UACP also analyses some factors, such as the permutation and combination of multiple sets orthogonal codes, asynchronous code offset, signal missing rate, signal misjudgment probability, and shows the advantages on slot utilization rate, identification rate and time efficiency compared with other algorithms. After adopting BPSK modulation and USRP platform, UACP is verified the time-efficiency increasing of 25--60{\%}.",

abstract="Trust Management has been proved to be an effective method to detect malicious nodes and ensure security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). While, most existing trust management methods are not good at dealing with uncertainty of trust relationship such as randomness, fuzziness in WSNs, which leads to inaccurate trust metric. In this paper, a trust evaluation method for clustered wireless sensor networks based on cloud model is proposed and evaluated, which implements the conversion between qualitative and quantitative of sensor nodes' trust metrics in order to achieve better trust evaluation. Firstly, the method considers multi-factors including communication factor, message factor and energy factor and builds mathematical model for each trust factor to get factor trust cloud. Secondly, immediate trust cloud is calculated by assigning adjustive weights for each factor trust cloud and combining them. Thirdly, recommendation trust cloud and immediate trust cloud are synthesized according to time sensitive factor in order to get final trust cloud. Furthermore, the final trust cloud of sensor node is converted to trust grade by trust cloud decision-making. Verification Experiments manifest that the proposed method has feasibility and accuracy in the aspect of evaluating sensor nodes' trust. Moreover, comparison experiments under different attacks show that our method is sensitive to multiple attacks, it outperforms other trust evaluation methods not only in the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes, but also in the tolerance of abnormal conditions.",

abstract="The emergence of cloud computing has made it become an attractive solution for large-scale data processing and storage applications. Cloud infrastructures provide users a remote access to powerful computing capacity, large storage space and high network bandwidth to deploy various applications. With the support of cloud computing, many large-scale applications have been migrated to cloud infrastructures instead of running on in-house local servers. Among these applications, continuous write applications (CWAs) such as online surveillance systems, can significantly benefit due to the flexibility and advantages of cloud computing. However, with specific characteristics such as continuous data writing and processing, and high level demand of data availability, cloud service providers prefer to use sophisticated models for provisioning resources to meet CWAs' demands while minimizing the operational cost of the infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel architecture of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs) or commonly referred to as Cloud-of-Clouds. Based on this architecture, we propose two operational cost-aware algorithms for provisioning cloud resources for CWAs, namely neighboring optimal resource provisioning algorithm and global optimal resource provisioning algorithm, in order to minimize the operational cost and thereby maximizing the revenue of CSPs. We validate the proposed algorithms through comprehensive simulations. The two proposed algorithms are compared against each other to assess their effectiveness, and with a commonly used and practically viable round-robin approach. The results demonstrate that NORPA and GORPA outperform the conventional round-robin algorithm by reducing the operational cost by up to 28 and 57 {\%}, respectively. The low complexity of the proposed cost-aware algorithms allows us to apply it to a realistic Cloud-of-Clouds environment in industry as well as academia.",

abstract="As IoT technology evolves, developments of ubiquitous computing accelerates. At the same time, threats of privacy exposure also increase since the IoT systems expose the information such as user's location or medical status collected from all sorts of things. To handle the data elaborately, the ubiquitous systems need to employ a technology that provides anonymity to prevent exposure of personal information. The group signature scheme is widely used for a cryptographic base for privacy protection which do not reveal user's identity but prove that he/she is a legitimate user. Recently, a number of researches concerning the basic group signature schemes with a differentiated linkability have been conducted to provide a more flexible service. However, existing researches focused on providing flexible services from the service provider's position. The systems are exposed to high possibilities of unnecessary breach of privacy. In this paper, we define a restrictive linkability for the anonymous services that require an adequate linkability with a minimum user-designated privacy exposure in anonymous services and propose an efficient group signature scheme providing restrictive linkability.",

abstract="Nowadays, mobile devices host many applications that are directly downloaded and installed from mobile application stores. The existence of such a large amount of apps for a myriad of purposes imposes a huge overhead on users, who are in charge of selecting, installing, and executing the appropriate apps, as well as deleting them when no longer needed. Moreover, these applications have mostly neglected to take into account the user's context, as they propose static non-evolving scenarios of use. The proposed long-life application provides a new way to respond to the user's needs on the fly. It evolves at run time (by including/ excluding business functionalities, updating the interaction mode, and migrating executions) according to the user's needs. While he/she moves in his/her surroundings, the app detects the occurring events and builds contextually-described situations. So, this work aims to offer a new type of mobile application able to detect, formulate and understand the users' context and react accordingly. Therefore, in this paper, we present the overall approach to build a long-life application and we focus on context detection and formulation aspects.",

abstract="Automated decision-making by computer algorithms based on data from our behaviors is fundamental to the digital economy. Automated decisions impact everyone, occurring routinely in education, employment, health care, credit, and government services. Technologies that generate tracking data, including smartphones, credit cards, websites, social media, and sensors, offer unprecedented benefits. However, people are vulnerable to errors and biases in the underlying data and algorithms, especially those with mental illness. Algorithms based on big data from seemingly unrelated sources may create obstacles to community integration. Voluntary online self-disclosure and constant tracking blur traditional concepts of public versus private data, medical versus non-medical data, and human versus automated decision-making. In contrast to sharing sensitive information with a physician in a confidential relationship, there may be numerous readers of information revealed online; data may be sold repeatedly; used in proprietary algorithms; and are effectively permanent. Technological changes challenge traditional norms affecting privacy and decision-making, and continued discussions on new approaches to provide privacy protections are needed.",

Despite its popularity, it is not always clear what big data refers to exactly. Big data has become a very popular topic in healthcare, where the term primarily refers to the vast and growing volumes of computerized medical information available in the form of electronic health records, administrative or health claims data, disease and drug monitoring registries and so on. This kind of data is generally collected routinely during administrative processes and clinical practice by different healthcare professionals: from doctors recording their patients' medical history, drug prescriptions or medical claims to pharmacists registering dispensed prescriptions. For a long time, this data accumulated without its value being fully recognized and leveraged. Today big data has an important place in healthcare, including in pharmacovigilance. The expanding role of big data in pharmacovigilance includes signal detection, substantiation and validation of drug or vaccine safety signals, and increasingly new sources of information such as social media are also being considered. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the uses of big data for drug safety post-marketing assessment.",

abstract="The sustainable management of wastes has attracted in the last decades an increasing number of industrial actors, policymakers and researchers. Environmental improvements, social responsibilities and economic opportunities led many manufacturers to implement different kinds of end-of-life (EoL) strategies. However, in many cases, these strategies are not supported by a correct commitment of top managers, but are implemented only in response to competitor's actions. This paper aims to improve the understanding of management practices concerning remanufacturing activities. A mixed evaluation model based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed. Its final aim is the evaluation of top management commitment in driving remanufacturing as an overall sustainable initiative into three different sectors (automotive, aerospace and medical equipments). The survey allowed to define the most critical factors for each sector and, so, to analyse underlying remanufacturing strategies.",

abstract="Today's medical industry can be represented by a human-centered u-healthcare paradigm that is available and accessible anywhere, where high-tech IT can serve as the basis at any time and any place. In addition, in the medical industry, studies of many of the developments and applications are actively conducted based on the development of information communication technology. The aim of medical-information systems is the construction of an advanced IT and integrated u-healthcare system that evolves in the direction of integrated medical-based IT-convergence systems. Accordingly, to resolve the problems of telemedicine, in terms of the remote access to medical data, some public and private initiatives have been proposed, ranging from patient-mobility approaches to medical data. In addition, regarding GENICloud, which provides links with the existing future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud, two out of the seven GENIAM APIs have been announced as the common APIs of the future Internet testbeds in GENI, and they have been implemented and are provided. In the present GENI Cloud system, due to the provision of limited APIs, restrictions may occur in the future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud system management. Therefore, this study proposes a cloud-based mobile health service for the enhancement of the quality of service (QoS) including factors such as reliability and response time to resolve the problems of the broadband-communication infrastructure in the existing mobile health service and the delay problem on the wireless body area network. In this paper, we propose the cloud-based u-healthcare network with a QoS-guaranteed mobile health service. For this method, the TMO-distribution object model that was used in the existing research to implement a reliable and efficient cloud system for users was not used, and instead, a cloud-platform environment was built up through the construction of a distributed system based on a cluster-based mobile object. For this purpose, this study considered the characteristics of the wireless-communication environments between the terminals and the cloud servers in the mobile cloud environment and the proposed cloud mobility services and the specialized mobile cloud-control software. Later, for linkages with cloud computing environments and testbeds was proposed. In addition, this study carried out a cloud mobility-control design to provide a service in the mobile cloud environment that is based on the actual future Internet testbeds. Lastly, based on the structured cloud-platform environment, this study designed access interfaces to provide a mobile healthcare service in consideration of the user convenience. For the mobile-service access interfaces, since the same service interfaces can be used to access the characteristics and functions of all of the applications from browsers and device clients, the model-view-controller structure of the platform was designed, including the components for the further improvement of the requirements, reuse, and maintenance of the codes in medium and large distributed systems.",

abstract="Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is the most convenient, cost-effective, accurate, and non-invasive technology for e-health monitoring. The performance of WBAN may be disturbed when coexisting with other wireless networks. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive study and in-depth analysis of coexistence issues and interference mitigation solutions in WBAN technologies. A thorough survey of state-of-the art research in WBAN coexistence issues is conducted. The survey classified, discussed, and compared the studies according to the parameters used to analyze the coexistence problem. Solutions suggested by the studies are then classified according to the followed techniques and concomitant shortcomings are identified. Moreover, the coexistence problem in WBAN technologies is mathematically analyzed and formulas are derived for the probability of successful channel access for different wireless technologies with the coexistence of an interfering network. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted using OPNET with several real-life scenarios to evaluate the impact of coexistence interference on different WBAN technologies. In particular, three main WBAN wireless technologies are considered: IEEE 802.15.6, IEEE 802.15.4, and low-power WiFi. The mathematical analysis and the simulation results are discussed and the impact of interfering network on the different wireless technologies is compared and analyzed. The results show that an interfering network (e.g., standard WiFi) has an impact on the performance of WBAN and may disrupt its operation. In addition, using low-power WiFi for WBANs is investigated and proved to be a feasible option compared to other wireless technologies.",

abstract="Pharmacovigilance, and generally applications of natural language processing models to healthcare, have attracted growing attention over the recent years. In particular, drug reactions can be extracted from user reviews posted on the Web, and automated processing of this information represents a novel and exciting approach to personalized medicine and wide-scale drug tests. In medical applications, demographic information regarding the authors of these reviews such as age and gender is of primary importance; however, existing studies usually either assume that this information is available or overlook the issue entirely. In this work, we propose and compare several approaches to automated mining of demographic information from user-generated texts. We compare modern natural language processing techniques, including extensions of topic models and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We apply single-task and multi-task learning approaches to this problem. Based on a real-world dataset mined from a health-related web site, we conclude that while CNNs perform best in terms of predicting demographic information by jointly learning different user attributes, topic models provide additional information and reflect gender-specific and age-specific symptom profiles that may be of interest for a researcher.",

This paper presents an integrated platform for the in-silico simulation of trauma incidents, based on a suite of interacting mathematical models. The models cover the generation of a scenario for an incident, a model of physiological evolution of the affected individuals, including the possible effect of the treatment, and a model of evolution in time of the required medical resources. The problem of optimal resource allocation is also investigated. Model parameters have been identified according to the expertise of medical doctors and by reviewing some related literature. The models have been implemented and exposed as web services, while some software clients have been built for the purpose of testing. Due to its extendability, our integrated platform highlights the potential of model-based simulation in different health-related fields, such as emergency medicine and personal health systems. Modifications of the models are already being used in the context of two funded projects, aiming at evaluating the response of health systems to major incidents with and without model-based decision support.",

abstract="With the advent of Internet and exponential growth in its users, that day is not far when the IP addresses used by Internet would exhaust and it would come to a standstill. Not only this to retrieve a data, dependency of server and network overhead can't be overruled but NDN overcomes both these issues of IP addresses and server dependency/network overhead by introducing content centering approach and retrieval from intermediate routers.IPv4 is the protocol, which is most common for Internet connections. It uses a 32-bit addressing scheme resulting in total of 232 addresses. As Internet is growing with fast pace it is expected that soon the unused addresses would be exhausted. A new addressing system IPv6 is used to have more addresses, which allows 2128 addresses. But we can't keep on going on increasing the addresses a newer approach is definitely required which gave birth to NDN in 2009. Keeping this in mind U.S. National Science Foundation's Future Internet Architectures started a project Named Data Networks (NDN). NDN retains the current IP based internet architecture but changes the functionality where signed named content are retrieved by the intended consumers instead of IP packets delivered to the destination.Initial investigation and feasibility studies show that NDN with its principles can remove the gap between internet usage applications and data transport. Furthermore it also aims to simplify the application development process and cater to few of the everlasting issues of today's internet architecture terms of security, scalability, and sustainability. With this aim put forward, the development, implementation and realization of the NDN architecture also faces a number of new challenges like naming and signing of all data chunks and changes in the routing and forwarding strategies. NDN project is still in offspring and there are various research issues which need to be addressed. This paper covers a brief survey of this future internet paradigm and bring out its major outcomes and areas to work in future.",

abstract="We are living in an era when the focus of human relationships with the world is shifting from execution and physical impact to control and cognitive/informational interaction. This emerging, increasingly informational world is our new ecology, an infosphere that presents the grounds for a cognitive revolution based on interactions in networks of biological and artificial, intelligent agents. After the industrial revolution, which extended the human body through mechanical machinery, the cognitive revolution extends the human mind/cognition through information-processing machinery. These novel circumstances come with new qualities and preferences demanding new conceptualizations. We have some work ahead of us to establish value systems and practices extended from the real to the increasingly virtual/info-computational. This paper first presents a current view of the virtual versus the real and then offers an interpretation framework based on an info-computational understanding of cognition in which agency implies computational processing of informational structures of the world as an infosphere. The notion of ``good life'' is discussed in light of different ideals of well-being in the infosphere, connecting virtuality as a space of potential and alternative worlds for an agent for whom the reality is a space of actual experiences, in the sense of Deleuze. Even though info-computational framework enables us to see both the real world and the diversity of virtual worlds in terms of computational processes on informational structures, based on a distinct layered cognitive architecture of all physical agents, there is clear difference between potential worlds of the virtual and actual agent's experiences made in the real. Info-computationalism enables insight into the mechanisms of infosphere and elucidates its importance as cognitively predominant environment and communication media. The conclusion is that by cocooning ourselves in an elaborate info-computational infrastructure of the virtual, we may be increasingly isolating ourselves from the reality of direct experience of the world. The biggest challenges of the cognitive revolution may not be technological but ethical. They are about the nature of being human and its values.",

abstract="Due to the enhancing of life quality, increasing of chronic diseases, changing lifestyles, and an expanding life expectancy, rapid population aging requires a new business model that promotes happiness and emphasizes a healthy body and mind through the ``anytime, anywhere well-being'' lifestyle. Recently, lifecare systems using IoT devices are being released as products that are influential on the overall society, and their effectiveness is continuously proven. In addition, based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, diverse companies are conducting investments and research to develop devices as well as solutions that connect to these devices. Accordingly, in this study, a mining-based lifecare-recommendation method using a peer-to-peer dataset and adaptive decision feedback is proposed. In addition to collecting PHRs, the proposed method measures life-logs such as dietary life, life pattern, sleep pattern, life behavior, and job career; the P2P-dataset preprocessed index information; and biometric information using a wearable device. It uses the Open API to collect the health-weather and life-weather index data from public data, and it uses a smart-band-type wearable device known as a biosensor to measure the heart rate, daily activity, and body temperature. It monitors the current status and conditions through the classification of life data, and it mines big data and uses a decision tree to analyze the association rules and correlations, as well as to discover new knowledge patterns. In the peer-to-peer networking, a lifecare recommendation model that uses adaptive decision feedback has been developed for the peer-to-peer platform. This adaptive decision feedback reflects an individual's importance or sensory level. Accordingly, it proposes more individualized and flexible results and can be configured to support intellectual lifecare. A mining-based lifecare-recommendation mobile service can also be developed to enhance the quality of life, as it provides user-based health management and reduces the medical expenses; accordingly, it enhances the service satisfaction and quality in the lifecare field.",

abstract="Towards the provision of medical research and eHealth services, several Health Information Technology (HIT) platforms are blended with communication and software technologies (i.e. mobile and Web applications, wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things and cloud computing). However, an important research issue is whether and to what degree these technologies are efficiently and effectively integrated into medical practice. Accordingly, this study reviews recent literature on HITs that employ RCTs, which are acknowledged as a reliable solution by the community of health stakeholders. Furthermore, it examines the research efforts in the field and evaluates the relevant functionalities. The literature search strategy was based on PRISMA 2009 Checklist and the CONSORT-EHEALTH Checklist that are two standard methodologies for systematic reviews in Evidence Based Medicine and Health Information Technologies. The analysis of the studies included was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The sources considered in this research include the most common clinical trial registries and academic electronic databases. The studies considered were conducted from 2008 until 2016. The authors considered RCTs having published their results in at least one article. As a result, 55 articles from 42 different journals are considered in this review. The benefits of the HIT delivered interventions are clearly presented in the outcomes of the relevant studies. Significant improvements were observed in the findings of 31 trials from a total of 51 (60.78{\%}) including the acceptance, satisfaction, reliability, usefulness, safety, effectiveness and financial benefit of HITs. The results of this review reveal that HIT and eHealth interventions achieve at least equally reliable and safe outcomes compared with the usual support methods of healthcare. Significantly encouraging results are noticed in interventions employing HIT over several healthcare fields.",

abstract="Nanotechnology is a new and very promising area of research which will allow several new applications to be created in different fields, such as, biological, medical, environmental, military, agricultural, industrial and consumer goods. This paper focuses specifically on nanocommunications, which will allow interconnected devices, at the nano-scale, to achieve collaborative tasks, greatly changing the paradigm in the fields described. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm which allows nanomachines to exchange information using molecules as carrier. This is the most promising nanocommunication method within nanonetworks, since it can use bio-inspired techniques, inherit from studied biological systems, which makes the connection of biologic and man-made systems a easier process. At this point, the biggest challenges in these type of nanocommunication are to establish feasible and reliable techniques that will allow information to be encoded, and mechanisms that ensure a molecular communication between different nodes. This paper focus on creating concepts and techniques to tackle these challenges, and establishing new foundations on which future work can be developed. The created concepts and techniques are then applied in an envisioned medical application, which is based on a molecular nanonetwork deployed inside the Human body. The goal of this medical application is to automatously monitor endocrine diseases using the benefits of nanonetworks, which in turn connects with the internet, thus creating a Internet of NanoThings system. The concepts and techniques developed are evaluated by performing several simulations and comparing with other researches, and the results and discussions are presented on the later sections of this paper.",

This study presents a miniature wearable cardiopulmonary monitoring system called ``Smart Chest Strap,'' which consists of an elastic band worn around the user's chest with integrated sensors, a physiological signals acquisition unit, and a mobile phone. The physiological signals including electrocardiogram, respiratory inductance plethysmograph, and accelerations (ACC) are sampled, digitalized, stored, and simultaneously transmitted to a mobile phone via Bluetooth. A medical validation test with participants performing discontinuous incremental treadmill (0--12 km/h) exercise was conducted. The results indicate nearly perfect correlations (0.999, 0.996, 0.994), small mean bias (0.60 BPM, 0.51 BPM, 0.05 g), and narrow limits of agreement ({\textpm}2.90 BPM, {\textpm}1.81 BPM, {\textpm}0.09 g) for heart rate (HR), breathing rate (BR), and ACC represented as vector magnitude units (VMUs). There is a general trend of decrease in accuracy, precision, and correlation for HR, BR, and VMU as velocity increases, but these validity statistics are all within acceptable error limits and clinically accepted. The findings demonstrate that the Smart Chest Strap is valid and will have wider applications in healthcare, sports, and scientific research areas.",

abstract="It is expected that the LTE network, which includes the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN) in 3GPP LTE systems, will be overloaded due to the huge number of Machine-Type Communication (MTC) devices in the near future. Overload in the RAN and CN of the LTE may result in congestion occurrence, resource waste, Quality of Service (QoS) degradation and in the worst-case, it will cause service unavailability. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive mechanism to manage a large number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN of the LTE network. We use Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme to regulate the MTC traffic according to the congestions level in the RAN and CN. We consider a scenario in which two-priority-based classes of MTC devices are contending for the RAN resources. At first, the overload problem in the RAN is formulated to find the number of allowable contending MTC devices of each class taking into account their required QoS. Then, an active load management policy based on additive increase multiplicative decrease rule is proposed to control the incoming load from multiple cells to the CN. To effectively limit the number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN, in the proposed approach, each Evolved Node B updates the ACB factor upon overload detection in the RAN or CN in an adaptive manner. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is able to manage overload in the CN and RAN simultaneously.",

abstract="Vertical handover gain significant importance due to the enhancements in mobility models by the Fourth Generation (4G) technologies. However, these enhancements are limited to specific scenarios and hence do not provide support for generic mobility. Similarly, various schemes are proposed based on these mobility models but most of them are suffered from the high packet loss, frequent handovers, too early and late handovers, inappropriate network selection, etc. To address these challenges, a generic vertical handover management scheme for heterogeneous wireless networks is proposed in this article. The proposed scheme works in three phases. In the first phase, a handover triggering approach is designed to identify the appropriate place for initiating handover based on the estimated coverage area of a WLAN access point or cellular base station. In the second phase, fuzzy rule based system is designed to eliminate the inappropriate networks before deciding an optimal network for handover. In the third phase, a network selection scheme is developed based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) decision mechanism. Various parameters such as delay, jitter, Bit Error Rate (BER), packet loss, communication cost, response time, and network load are considered for selecting an optimal network. The proposed scheme is tested in a mobility scenario with different speeds of a mobile node ranging from very low to very high. The simulation results are compared with the existing decision models used for network selection and handover triggering approaches. The proposed scheme outperforms these schemes in terms of energy consumption, handover delay and time, packet loss, good put, etc.",

A Facebook application was created to collect data concerning adherence to the Mediterranean diet, considering the significant risk of cardiovascular and neurological degenerative diseases in subjects with poor adherence to a healthy diet. More than 1400 users were recruited in a short time without any promotional action. Collected data indicate that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is in general greater in older users vs young (,

abstract="With the increasing demand for automated, remote, intelligent, and real-time healthcare services in smart cities, smart healthcare monitoring is necessary to provide improved and complete care to residents. In this monitoring, health-related media or signals collected from smart-devices/objects are transmitted and processed to cater to the need for quality care. However, it is challenging to create a framework or method to handle media-related healthcare data analytics or signals (e.g., voice/audio, video, or electroglottographic (EGG) signals) to meet the complex on-demand healthcare needs for successful smart city management. To this end, this paper proposes a cloud-oriented smart healthcare monitoring framework that interacts with surrounding smart devices, environments, and smart city stakeholders for affordable and accessible healthcare. As a smart city healthcare monitoring case study, a voice pathology detection (VPD) method is proposed. In the proposed method, two types of input, a voice signal and an EGG signal, are used. The input devices are connected to the Internet and the captured signals are transmitted to the cloud. The signals are then processed and classified as either normal or pathologic with a confidence score. These results are passed to registered doctors that make the final decision and take appropriate action. To process the signals, local features are extracted from the first-order derivative of the voice signal, and shape and cepstral features are extracted from the EGG signal. For classification, a Gaussian mixture model-based approach is used. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve VPD that is more than 93{\%} accurate.",

In order to guarantee security of this data over open networks, a secure data transmission mechanism between WBAN and application provider's servers is of necessity. Modified medical data does not provide a true reflection of an individuals state of health and its subsequent use for diagnosis could lead to an irreversible medical condition. In this paper, we propose a lightweight certificateless signcryption scheme for secure transmission of data between WBAN and servers. Our proposed scheme not only provides confidentiality of data and authentication in a single logical step, it is lightweight and resistant to key escrow attacks. We further provide security proof that our scheme provides indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack in random oracle model. Compared with two other Diffie-Hellman based signcryption schemes proposed by Barbosa and Farshim (BF) and another by Yin and Liang (YL), our scheme consumes 46 {\%} and 8 {\%} less energy during signcryption than BF and YL scheme respectively.",

abstract="When everything you see is data, what ethical principles apply? This paper argues that first-person digital recording technologies challenge traditional institutional approaches to research ethics, but that this makes ethics governance more important, not less so. We review evolving ethical concerns across four fields: Visual ethics; ubiquitous computing; mobile health; and grey literature from applied or market research. Collectively, these bodies of literature identify new challenges to traditional notions of informed consent, anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, beneficence and maleficence. Challenges come from the ever-increasing power, breadth and multi-functional integration of recording technologies, and the ubiquity and normalization of their use by participants. Some authors argue that these evolving relationships mean that institutional ethics governance procedures are irrelevant or no longer apply. By contrast, we argue that the fundamental principles of research ethics frameworks have become even more important for the protection of research participants, and that institutional frameworks need to adapt to keep pace with the ever-increasing power of recording technologies and the consequent risks to privacy. We conclude with four recommendations for efforts to ensure that contemporary visual recording research is held appropriately accountable to ethical standards: (i) minimizing the detail, scope, integration and retention of captured data, and limiting its accessibility; (ii) formulating an approach to ethics that takes in both the `common rule' approaches privileging anonymity and confidentiality together with principles of contextual judgement and consent as an ongoing process; (iii) developing stronger ethical regulation of research outside academia; (iv) engaging the public and research participants in the development of ethical guidelines.",

Significant efforts have been devoted by academia and research community to study and build secure frameworks in cloud environment, but there exists a research gap for comprehensive study of security frameworks in mobile cloud computing environment. Therefore, we aim to conduct a comprehensive survey to analyze various cryptographic, biometric and multifactor lightweight solutions for data security in mobile cloud. This survey highlights the current security issues in mobile cloud environment and infrastructure, investigates various data security frameworks and provides a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art data security frameworks and deep insight into open research issues for ensuring security and privacy of data in mobile cloud computing platform.",

abstract="In recent years, vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has emerged as a new technology which is being used in wide range of applications in the area of multimedia-based healthcare applications. In VCC, vehicles act as the intelligent machines which can be used to collect and transfer the healthcare data to the local, or global sites for storage, and computation purposes, as vehicles are having comparatively limited storage and computation power for handling the multimedia files. However, due to the dynamic changes in topology, and lack of centralized monitoring points, this information can be altered, or misused. These security breaches can result in disastrous consequences such as-loss of life or financial frauds. Therefore, to address these issues, a learning automata-assisted distributive intrusion detection system is designed based on clustering. Although there exist a number of applications where the proposed scheme can be applied but, we have taken multimedia-based healthcare application for illustration of the proposed scheme. In the proposed scheme, learning automata (LA) are assumed to be stationed on the vehicles which take clustering decisions intelligently and select one of the members of the group as a cluster-head. The cluster-heads then assist in efficient storage and dissemination of information through a cloud-based infrastructure. To secure the proposed scheme from malicious activities, standard cryptographic technique is used in which the auotmaton learns from the environment and takes adaptive decisions for identification of any malicious activity in the network. A reward and penalty is given by the stochastic environment where an automaton performs its actions so that it updates its action probability vector after getting the reinforcement signal from the environment. The proposed scheme was evaluated using extensive simulations on ns-2 with SUMO. The results obtained indicate that the proposed scheme yields an improvement of 10  {\%} in detection rate of malicious nodes when compared with the existing schemes.",

abstract="As the overall population ages, driving-related accidents and injuries, associated with elderly drivers, have risen. Existing research about elderly drivers mainly focuses on factual data collection and analysis, indicating the elderly's growing fatal accident rates and their different behaviours compared to younger drivers. However, few research has focused on design-led practical solutions to mitigate the elderly's growing fatal accidents, by considering their usability and body conditions, afflicting the elderly, such as decreased vision, hearing, and reaction times. In this paper, first, current worldwide situations on growing fatal accident rates for elderly drivers is reviewed and the key impact factors are identified and discussed with regarding to usability and design trend in the automotive technology for elderly. Second, existing smart vehicle technology-based solutions to promote safe driving are explored and their pros and cons are discussed and analysed. Most of solutions are not created by people with driving difficulties, which are caused by health problems most commonly afflicting the elderly. Thirdly, diverse design-led research activities are taken, such as a survey, observation, and interviews to gain new understanding of what kinds of driving problems elderly drivers have and demonstrate how new system concepts could be developed for the elderly's benefits. Finally, it is found that the elderly's low vision and late reaction are main factors causing their driving difficulties. Based on this finding, usable vehicle system design ideas have been proposed, by utilising facial expression sensing technology as a solution. The proposed solutions would ensure reducing both the elderly's driving problems and high fatal accident rates and provide a more enjoyable driving environment for the elderly population.",

As a typical representation, wireless body area networks (WBANs) has also promoted the development of medical technology into a higher field. However, collecting data from users seriously affects personal privacy and security, that WBANs needs to overcome. In order to resolve the flaws of the existing secure authentication protocols in WBANs, we propose a lightweight implicit authentication protocol based on the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vantone (ECQV) algorithm. Moreover, we take advantage of the bidirectional key chain to design a group key management protocol between the personal digital assistance (PDA) and each of cluster head sensor nodes. The security and performance analysis show that our protocol can be performed with perfect forward security and backward security in data communication. In addition, the experimental simulation and theoretic analysis show that our protocol is more suitable for WBANs.",

More and more, machines are making complex decisions with a considerable level of autonomy. We should be much more preoccupied by this problem than we currently are. After a series of preliminary remarks, this paper will go over four possible answers to the question raised above. First, we may claim that it is the maker of a machine that gets to decide how it will behave in morally laden scenarios. Second, we may claim that the users of a machine should decide. Third, that decision may have to be made collectively or, fourth, by other machines built for this special purpose. The paper argues that each of these approaches suffers from its own shortcomings, and it concludes by showing, among other things, which approaches should be emphasized for different types of machines, situations, and/or morally laden decisions.",

We then explore the importance and utility of research ethics as operationalized by existing human subjects research frameworks to guide the consideration of therapeutic robotic users---a step vital to the continued research and development of these platforms. Together, privacy and research ethics frameworks provide two complementary approaches to protect users and ensure responsible yet robust information sharing for technology development.

abstract="Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application's interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

Development of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution having benefits of better quality of service, reduced cost, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper, an effective cloud computing system is proposed which predicts MERS-CoV-infected patients using Bayesian belief network and provides geographic-based risk assessment to control its outbreak. The proposed system is tested on synthetic data generated for 0.2 million users. System provided high accuracy for classification and appropriate geographic-based risk assessment. The key point of this paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV users on Google maps so that possibly infected users can be quarantined as early as possible. It will help uninfected citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government agencies to manage the problem more effectively.",

In the work, we discussed transmission energy and delay problems of data collection by MS in WSN with duty cycle.

Cognitive radio is able to exploit spectrum opportunities and increase the communication performance for the e-healthcare system. To access the spectrum safely, the security aspect of spectrum utilization should be carefully addressed. A well-known threat to the spectrum utilization is the primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in which the attackers emulate as the primary users to obtain spectrum opportunities. To defend this threat, in this paper, we propose a triple threshold energy detection (TTED) to identify the PUEA. Based on the TTED, legitimate devices are allowed to access the available channels when the licensed channel is idle or occupied by attackers. To evaluate our proposed access scheme, we derive the achievable throughput while the average transmission time is fixed and exponential distributed, respectively.",

In WBANs, sensors placed in or around the human body collect the sensitive data of the body and transmit it through an open wireless channel in which the messages may be intercepted, modified, etc. Recently, Wang et al. presented a new anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs and claimed that their scheme can solve the security problems in the previous schemes. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that their scheme cannot withstand impersonation attack. Either an adversary or a malicious legal client could impersonate another legal client to the application provider. In this paper, we give the detailed weakness analysis of Wang et al.'s scheme at first. Then we present a novel anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs and prove that it's secure under a random oracle model. At last, we demonstrate that our presented anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs is more suitable for practical application than Wang et al.'s scheme due to better security and performance. Compared with Wang et al.'s scheme, the computation cost of our scheme in WBANs has reduced by about 31.58 {\%}.",

abstract="Funded research has been linked to academic production and performance. While the presence of funding acknowledgements may serve as an indicator of quality to some extent, we still lack tools to evaluate whether funding agencies allocate resources to novel and innovative research rather than mature fields. We address this issue in the present study by using bibliometrics. In particular, we exploit the citation network properties of academic articles to classify specific research fields into four categories: change maker, breakthrough, incremental, and matured. We then use funding acknowledgement information to identify the sponsors involved in each research type to characterize funding agencies. We focus our analysis on the robotics field in order to reveal international trends of financial acknowledgements. We find that the incremental and matured research areas show the highest counts of funding acknowledgements. Moreover, although research funded by some agencies is mostly recognized as incremental-type research, those in other categories may perform better in terms of the number of citations. Additionally, we analyze the interest of selected funding agencies in granular subject categories. The characterization of funding agencies in this study may help policymakers and funding organizations assess or adjust their strategies, benchmark with other key players, and obtain an overview of local and global acknowledgement trends.",

abstract="We present a portable system for personalized blood cell counting consisting of a microfluidic impedance cytometer and portable analog readout electronics, feeding into an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and being transmitted via Bluetooth to a user-accessible mobile application. We fabricated a microfluidic impedance cytometer with a novel portable analog readout. The novel design of the analog readout, which consists of a lock-in-amplifier followed by a high-pass filter stage for subtraction of drift and DC offset, and a post-subtraction high gain stage, enables detection of particles and cells as small as 1 $\mu$m in diameter, despite using a low-end 8-bit ADC. The lock-in-amplifier and the ADC were set up to receive and transmit data from a Bluetooth module. In order to initiate the system, as well as to transmit all of the data, a user friendly mobile application was developed, and a proof-of-concept trial was run on a blood sample. Applications such as personalized health monitoring require robust device operation and resilience to clogging. It is desirable to avoid using channels comparable in size to the particles being detected thus requiring high levels of sensitivity. Despite using low-end off-the-shelf hardware, our sensing platform was capable of detecting changes in impedance as small as 0.032{\%}, allowing detection of 3 $\mu$m diameter particles in a 300 $\mu$m wide channel. The sensitivity of our system is comparable to that of a high-end bench-top impedance spectrometer when tested using the same sensors. The novel analog design allowed for an instrument with a footprint of less than 80 cm2. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the potential of using microfluidic impedance spectroscopy for low cost health monitoring. We demonstrated the utility of the platform technology towards cell counting, however, our platform is broadly applicable to assaying wide panels of biomarkers including proteins, nucleic acids, and various cell types.",

abstract="This study presents a systematic literature review of access control for electronic health record systems to protect patient's privacy. Articles from 2006 to 2016 were extracted from the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Science Direct, MEDLINE, and MetaPress using broad eligibility criteria, and chosen for inclusion based on analysis of ISO22600. Cryptographic standards and methods were left outside the scope of this review. Three broad classes of models are being actively investigated and developed: access control for electronic health records, access control for interoperability, and access control for risk analysis. Traditional role-based access control models are extended with spatial, temporal, probabilistic, dynamic, and semantic aspects to capture contextual information and provide granular access control. Maintenance of audit trails and facilities for overriding normal roles to allow full access in emergency cases are common features. Access privilege frameworks utilizing ontology-based knowledge representation for defining the rules have attracted considerable interest, due to the higher level of abstraction that makes it possible to model domain knowledge and validate access requests efficiently.",

abstract="The latest achievements in sensor technologies for blood glucose level monitoring, pump miniaturization for insulin delivery, and the availability of portable computing devices are paving the way toward the artificial pancreas as a treatment for diabetes patients. This device encompasses a controller unit that oversees the administration of insulin micro-boluses and continuously drives the pump based on blood glucose readings acquired in real time. In order to foster the research on the artificial pancreas and prepare for its adoption as a therapy, the European Union in 2010 funded the AP@home project, following a series of efforts already ongoing in the USA. This paper, authored by members of the AP@home consortium, reports on the technical issues concerning the design and implementation of an architecture supporting the exploitation of an artificial pancreas platform. First a PC-based platform was developed by the authors to prove the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithms responsible for insulin administration. A mobile-based one was then adopted to improve the comfort for the patients. Both platforms were tested on real patients, and a description of the goals, the achievements, and the major shortcomings that emerged during those trials is also reported in the paper.",

abstract="Mobility prediction is a technique in which the future location of a user is identified in a given network. Mobility prediction provides solutions to many day-to-day life problems. It helps in seamless handovers in wireless networks to provide better location based services and to recalculate paths in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET). In the present study, a framework is presented which predicts user mobility in presence and absence of mobility history. Na{\"i}ve Bayesian classification algorithm and Markov Model are used to predict user future location when user mobility history is available. An attempt is made to predict user future location by using Short Message Service (SMS) and instantaneous Geological coordinates in the absence of mobility patterns. The proposed technique compares the performance metrics with commonly used Markov Chain model. From the experimental results it is evident that the techniques used in this work gives better results when considering both spatial and temporal information. The proposed method predicts user's future location in the absence of mobility history quite fairly. The proposed work is applied to predict the mobility of medical rescue vehicles and social security systems.",

abstract="Brain--computer interfacing technologies are used as assistive technologies for patients as well as healthy subjects to control devices solely by brain activity. Yet the risks associated with the misuse of these technologies remain largely unexplored. Recent findings have shown that BCIs are potentially vulnerable to cybercriminality. This opens the prospect of ``neurocrime'': extending the range of computer-crime to neural devices. This paper explores a type of neurocrime that we call brain-hacking as it aims at the illicit access to and manipulation of neural information and computation. As neural computation underlies cognition, behavior and our self-determination as persons, a careful analysis of the emerging risks of malicious brain-hacking is paramount, and ethical safeguards against these risks should be considered early in design and regulation. This contribution is aimed at raising awareness of the emerging risk of malicious brain-hacking and takes a first step in developing an ethical and legal reflection on those risks.",

abstract="The use of IEEE 802.15.4 standard based application systems has been rapidly increasing, for example, in medical services, sensor networks, public safety systems, and home automation systems. However, issues arise from the fact that IEEE 802.15.4 standard based low rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) use the same frequency bands as wireless local area networks (WLANs), and they interfere with each other. Based on past research on this issue, the interference has a more serious impact on LR-WPANs' performance than on WLANs' performance. In this paper we propose a method to improve LR-WPANs' performance while coexisting with WLANs, which is called the reliable beacon transmission based medium access control (MAC) protocol. Since the reliability of a beacon frame is important, in this method, only the beacon frame is transmitted in interference-free channels, and the data packets are transmitted in interfered channels instead of abandoning the channels altogether. This method increases the reliability of beacon frames as well as overall channel utilizations. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated through extensive simulations, and this paper proves that this method improves the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 based wireless sensor networks (WSNs) over WLANs' interferences.",

abstract="The remote health monitoring system (RHMS) has become more real-time because the internet plus technology develops quickly. To support real-time health monitoring server, three main aspects, such as collecting, transferring and analyzing the health data, should be integrated into a system. So far, many challenges have been solved and many RHMSs have been applied in our daily lives. It is significant to use RHMS to take good care of clients who live alone, especially monitors the health data of clients in nursing home. This paper introduces a health gateway which automatically collects information of the clients. The information includes the users' identity, vital signs, body temperature, clients' real-time location and falling action detection. Moreover, the health gateway transmits information in WIFI relaying mode until the information is received by the background server. If the information is abnormal, the health gateway would send an alarm to the server. The server should call a doctor or caretaker and send accurate navigation based on real-time location in 3D architectural modeling to their mobile devices for finding clients quickly.",

abstract="There is a global trend of the shortage of nature resources, such as water and wildlife, which have suffered dramatic losses due to over-use, pollution, habitat loss, and, increasingly, changes caused by global warming. To make the planet more sustainable, abundant data has to be collected and analyzed from ecosystems for scientific decision-making, restoring and preserving natural resources. In this paper, an integrated systems approach has been proposed for the data acquisition and analysis in information management of an ecosystem; it is a direct extension of an agriculture ecosystem enterprise information system (AEEIS) developed by Xu et al. (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 3:5--17, 2008). The challenges in system development have been discussed, and the significance of the developed system has been illustrated through a thorough discussion and a case study on the genetic coding and expression of antelopes. In the case study, an IoT-based enterprise information system (EIS) has been applied to investigate the effects of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on the adaptation mechanism to high altitude hypoxia. Two remarkable conclusions are (i) the levels of the STAT3 mRNA and protein vary from one tissue to another, and the highest level is in the lung tissue, and (ii) Tibetan antelope's expression of STAT3 mRNA and protein are higher than that from plain sheep. Based on the fact that a Tibetan antelope has a higher adaptability to hypoxia; it has illustrated that the hypoxic STAT3-specific expression is one of the molecular bases of high altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan antelope.",

It analyzes the potential and feasibility of writing and reading small breadcrumbs of information at/from residents' RFID wristbands, as a solution to the inherent difficulties of gathering, processing and disseminating data within a multi-user, multi-stakeholder assistive environment such as a residence or a caring home.

abstract="The monitoring and assessment of the fetus condition are considered to be among the most important obstetric issues to consider during pregnancy and the prenatal period. Monitoring the fetal condition is required to detect the presence of any abnormalities in the oxygen supply to the fetus early in the antenatal or labor period. Early detection can prevent permanent brain damage and death, both of which may arise from suffocation caused by fetal disease, hypoxic-ischemic injury in the neonatal brain, or chronic fetal asphyxia. In this paper, we propose a new signal-fitting method, FitMine, that identifies the fetal condition by analyzing fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals that are non-invasively measured by cardiotocography (CTG). FitMine is a novel nonlinear dynamic model that reflects the relation between the FHR and UC signals; it combines the chaotic population model and unscented Kalman filter algorithm. The proposed method has several benefits. These are: (a) change-point detection: the proposed method can detect significant pattern variations such as high or low peaks changing suddenly in the FHR and UC signals; (b) parameter-free: it is performed automatically without the requirement for the user to enter input parameters; (c) scalability: FitMine is linearly scalable according to the size of the input data; and (d) applicability: the proposed model can be applied to detect abnormal signs in various domains including electroencephalogram data, epidemic data, temperature data, in addition to CTG recordings.",

We design the system in such a way that it provides good recognition accuracy, provides low-cost modeling, and is scalable. The system takes two main types of input, video and audio, which are captured in a multi-sensory environment. Speech and video input are processed separately during feature extraction and modeling; these two input modalities are merged at score level, where the scores are obtained from the models of different patients' states. For the experiments, 100 people were recruited to mimic a patient's states of normal, pain, and tensed. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an average 98.2 {\%} recognition accuracy.",

Its complicated etiology and chronic clinical features make it difficult for users to be conscious of their own depression emotion and seriously threaten the patient's life safety. With the development of e-commerce, intelligent recommender system has brought new opportunities to personalized health monitoring for the users with emotional distress. Therefore, this paper puts forward the emHealth system, which is an intelligent health recommendation system with depression prediction for emotion health. This paper explores the monitoring and improvement of users psychological and physiological conditions by pushing personalized therapy solutions to patients with emotional distress. Specifically, this paper first proposes the system architecture of emHealth. Then, we design personalized mobile phone Apps to collect emotional data of users with tendentious depressive mood, and find the five main external characteristics of depression by Pearson correlation analysis. We divide 1047 volunteers data into training set and test set, and construct prediction model of depression using decision tree and support vector machine algorithms. For the different external factors that lead to depression, we give personalized recommendation and intelligent decision-making solution, and push related emotional improvement suggestions to guide users behavior. Finally, a specific application scene is demonstrated where patient's family member carry out psychological counseling for the patient, to verify the practicability and validity of the system. The beneficial effects of this system can meet the needs of the electronic market and can be promoted and popularized.",

abstract="Reversible information hiding plays an important roles in the field of privacy protection. In this paper, a new reversible information hiding scheme is proposed which supports the direct operation in homomorphic encrypted domain. The proposed ``Joint Hiding and Tracing, JHT'' tactics and the ``3 Level Integrity Authentication Scheme'' devote to piracy tracing and integrity authentication. To enhance security, the Paillier homomorphic encryption and Arnold technology are employed. Furthermore, we present the dual region division tactics including Data/Signature region division and Texture/Smooth region division. Data/Signature region division is to circumvent conflicts, and Texture/Smooth region division is fit well with the human visual characteristics. Besides, neighboring quadratic optimization approach is presented to eliminate the smooth/texture isolated islands in the texture/smooth regions. In addition, Extended Integer Transform and position image are developed to achieve reversibility and circumvent overflow/underflow problems. Experimental results confirm the efficient of the proposed scheme, and demonstrate it not only realizes privacy protection, integrity authentication and piracy tracing, but also holds the characteristics of higher security, larger capacity and better restoration quality.",

abstract="In recent years, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers have played a crucial role in providing data fusion and high accuracy classification solutions for various, complex, non-linear problems. Their popularity accompanied by the ever-increasing need of implementing it on computationally weak, portable or even wearable systems has refueled the effort to accelerate their execution. In this paper, we explore FPGA-based acceleration to produce efficient SVM hardware co-processors. We propose a systematic two-level approach for SVM acceleration, which first optimizes the global structure of the original SVM's behavioral description to exploit the data- and instruction-level parallelism and then further refines it through a targeted design exploration that matches the accelerator's memory architecture to its computation and memory access patterns. The proposed methodology has been implemented as a framework on top of Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. We evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology through a rich set of analysis and validation results, which show that its adoption delivers SVM accelerator designs achieving latency gains of up to 98.78 {\%} in respect to Vivado-HLS default optimized solution. Finally, using as a case study an ECG analysis and Arrhythmia detection system we show that a target Zynq programmable SoC utilizing the optimized SVM accelerator design outperforms pure software implementations in numerous single or dual core target platforms, achieving speedups, which range from 10 {\texttimes} up to 78 {\texttimes}.",

abstract="Over the last 5 years, wearable technology -- comprising devices whose embedded sensors and analytic algorithms can track, analyze and guide wearers' behavior -- has increasingly captured the attention of venture capitalists, technology startups, established electronics companies and consumers. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call `data for life', wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.",

However, previous methods overlooked the privacy protection issue, leading to privacy violation. In this paper, a differential privacy protection scheme for sensitive big data in BSNs is proposed. A tree structure is constructed to reduce errors and provide long range queries. Haar Wavelet transformation method is applied to convert histogram into a complete binary tree. At last, to verify the advantages of our scheme, several experiments are conducted to show the outperformed results. Experimental results demonstrate that the tree structure greatly reduces the calculation overheads which preserves differential privacy for users.",

Of the 1911 identified studies, nine met the inclusion criteria of quantitative or mixed methods design, technology-enabled adherence and or retention intervention for US HIV-infected youth. The majority were small pilots. Intervention dose varied between studies applying similar technology platforms with more than half not informed by a theoretical framework. Retention in care was not a reported outcome, and operationalization of adherence was heterogeneous across studies. Despite these limitations, synthesized findings from this review demonstrate feasibility of computer-based interventions, and initial efficacy of SMS texting for adherence support among HIV-infected youth.

abstract="Mobile crowd sensing significantly facilitates a broad range of emerging applications by treating mobile devices of ordinary users as basic sensing units to distribute sensing tasks and collect sensing data. Owing to the continuity of data sensing and richness of content, resource-constrained mobile devices always outsource their collected data into the cloud for file sharing. The existing work enables only batch decryption limited to RSA algorithm and merely allows one specific file to be shared among multiple authorized receivers by exploiting the technique of attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this paper, a generalized efficient batch cryptosystem GBC and its extension GBCS are firstly proposed to achieve both batch encryption and batch decryption from any public key encryption algorithm. Then, our proposed GBC is further extended to FMFS, TMFS and MMFS to address secure multiple file sharing in the cloud-assisted mobile crowd sensing network, respectively for fine-grained multi-receiver multi-file sharing, file authority transfer and multiple file owners's settings. Finally, formal security proof is given to show our proposed generalized efficient batch cryptosystems GBC, GBCS and secure multiple file sharing schemes are respectively secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2) in the random oracle model and under the assumption on the computational hardness of the subset decision problem in the standard model. Extensive evaluations illustrate our secure multiple file sharing in cloud-assisted crowd sensing network based on the newly-devised GBC dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art in storage, computational and communication overhead.",

abstract="Since heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to evaluate the physiological status of the human body, devices specifically designed for such applications are needed. To this end, we developed a smart electrocardiography (ECG) patch. The smart patch measures ECG using three electrodes integrated into the patch, filters the measured signals to minimize noise, performs analog-to-digital conversion, and detects R-peaks. The measured raw ECG data and the interval between the detected R-peaks can be recorded to enable long-term HRV analysis. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the built-in R-wave detection, robustness of the device under motion, and applicability to the evaluation of mental stress. The R-peak detection results obtained with the device exhibited a sensitivity of 99.29{\%}, a positive predictive value of 100.00{\%}, and an error of 0.71{\%}. The device also exhibited less motional noise than conventional ECG recording, being stable up to a walking speed of 5 km/h. When applied to mental stress analysis, the device evaluated the variation in HRV parameters in the same way as a normal ECG, with very little difference. This device can help users better understand their state of health and provide physicians with more reliable data for objective diagnosis.",

Next, we submit those features to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. Two improvements were proposed for MLP. One improvement is the pruning technique that determines the optimal hidden neuron number. We compared three pruning techniques: dynamic pruning (DP), Bayesian detection boundaries (BDB), and Kappa coefficient (KC). The other improvement is to use the adaptive real-coded biogeography-based optimization (ARCBBO) to train the biases and weights of MLP. The experiments showed that the proposed FRFE{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}KC-MLP{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}ARCBBO achieved an average accuracy of 99.53 {\%} based on 10 repetitions of K-fold cross validation, which was better than 11 recent PBDS methods.",

In the first study, we used self-report techniques to gather data, and found that previous technological experience had a significant effect on the perceived anxiety of elders; while on the second study, we used indirect observation techniques to gather data, and found that previous technological experience had a significant effect on the perceived enjoyment of elders. After a further analysis of the video recordings of the playing sessions, we identified that elders developed two different approaches to their using the application (explore-and-learn and score-and-compete), which could be related to their previous technological experience, and explain the identified differences. We observed that in the presence of problems, the response of participants was different depending on the adopted behavior.

abstract="Herein demonstrated experiment studies two methods, namely convection and body resistance, to approximate human core body temperature. The proposed system is highly energy efficient that consumes only 165 mW power and runs on 5 VDC source. The implemented solution employs an IR thermographic sensor of industry grade along with AT Mega 328 breakout board. Ordinarily, the IR sensor is placed 1.5--30 cm away from human forehead (i.e., non-invasive) and measured the raw data in terms of skin and ambient temperature which is then converted using appropriate approximation formula to find out core body temperature. The raw data is plotted, visualized, and stored instantaneously in a local machine by means of two tools such as Makerplot, and JAVA-JAR. The test is performed when human object is in complete rest and after 10 min of walk. Achieved results are compared with the CoreTemp CM-210 sensor (by Terumo, Japan) which is calculated to be 0.7 {\textdegree}F different from the average value of BCT, obtained by the proposed IR sensor system. Upon a slight modification, the presented model can be connected with a remotely placed Internet of Things cloud service, which may be useful to inform and predict the user's core body temperature through a probabilistic view. It is also comprehended that such system can be useful as wearable device to be worn on at the hat attachable way.",

abstract="The wide availability of embedded sensor platforms and low-cost cameras---together with the developments in wireless communication---make it now possible the conception of pervasive intelligent systems based on vision. Such systems may be understood as distributed and collaborative sensor networks, able to produce, aggregate and process images in order to understand the observed scene and communicate the relevant information found about it. In this paper, we investigate the peculiarities of visual sensor networks with respect to standard vision systems and we identify possible strategies to accomplish image processing and analysis tasks over them. Although the rather strong constraints in computational and transmission power of embedded platforms that may prevent the use of state of the art computer vision and pattern recognition methods, we argue that multi-node processing methods may be envisaged to decompose a complex task into a hierarchy of computationally simpler problems to be solved over the nodes of the network. These ideas are illustrated by describing an application of visual sensor network to infomobility. In particular, we consider an experimental setting in which several views of a parking lot are acquired by the sensor nodes in the network. By integrating the various views, the network is capable to provide a description of the scene in terms of the available spaces in the parking lot.",

The healthcare field is one of the popular services for this technology that adopts wearable devices to sense signals of negative physiological events, and to notify users. The development and implementation of long-term healthcare monitoring that can prevent or quickly respond to the occurrence of disease and accidents present an interesting challenge for computing power and energy limits. This study proposed an adaptive sensor data segments selection method for wearable health care services, and considered the sensing frequency of the various signals from human body, as well as the data transmission among the devices. The healthcare service regulates the sensing frequency of devices by considering the overall cloud computing environment and the sensing variations of wearable health care services. The experimental results show that the proposed service can effectively transmit the sensing data and prolong the overall lifetime of health care services.",

There are many clustering algorithms but k-mean algorithm is most popular and widely used in many fields such as image processing, machine learning, pattern reorganization etc.; but it has a major drawback that is; its output is really sensitive to the random selection of initial centroids or its final output is totally depends on initial selection of centroids. Because of this drawback many techniques were introduced for K-mean algorithm. This paper introduces an initial centroid selection method for K-mean algorithm by using Atkinson Index. Atkinson index is a technique for measuring the inequality here. It is used for initial seed selection; experimental result shows that the proposed technique, which we applying on liver patient data set gives more accurate result than the original K-mean algorithm.",

abstract="Falls are reported to be the leading causes of accidental deaths among elderly people. Automatic detection of falls from video sequences is an assistant technology for low-cost health care systems. In this paper, we present a novel slow feature analysis based framework for fall detection in a house care environment. Firstly, a foreground human body is extracted by a background subtraction technique. After morphological operations, the human silhouette is refined and covered by a fitted ellipse. Secondly, six shape features are quantified from the covered silhouette to represent different human postures. With the help of the learned slow feature functions, the shape feature sequences are transformed into slow feature sequences with discriminative information about human actions. To represent the fall incidents, the squared first order temporal derivatives of the slow features are accumulated into a classification vector. Lastly, falls are distinguished from other daily actions, such as walking, crouching, and sitting, by the trained directed acyclic graph support vector machine. Experiments on the multiple-camera fall dataset and the SDUFall dataset demonstrate that our method is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving 94.00{\%} recognition rate on the former dataset and 96.57{\%} on the latter one.",

Shape-changing materials (e.g. shape memory polymers) incorporated in 3D printing have given birth to 4D printing, where 3D printed structures change in their shapes by external stimuli (temperature, light, water, etc.). The motivation of this review paper is to discuss mutual benefits from both 3D printed smart devices and 4D printed features, which can be built in a single body. It is expected that the combination of 3D printed smart devices and 4D printing would contribute to the development of high performance, adaptability to the environment and programmable 3D smart devices, which have not yet existed.

journal="Wireless Personal Communications",

month="Nov",
day="28",
abstract="In this work, the effect of additive white Gaussian noise and fading channel on the compressed sensing or compressive sampling (CS) image reconstruction process are demonstrated. First, the work suggests encoding of the sensed samples by low density parity check code (LDPC) before transmission. It is well known that longer is the length of the LDPC codes better (lower) is the bit error rate (BER) performance. Thus to improve CS reconstruction a method to construct a larger length but 4 cycle free irregular LDPC code structure is also proposed. The code construction is based on the LDPC code in IEEE WiMAX standard. The proposed CS-LDPC structure is then extended for                                                                   {\$}{\$}4^n{\$}{\$}                                                                            4                      n                                                                    -QAM to find an optimal set of thresholds by minimizing BER (equivalently symbol error rate) using differential evolution (DE). The algorithm works on the log likelihood ratio values obtained by LDPC decoding. Extensive simulation results show the efficacy of the use of LDPC codes and the trade-off in code rate and measurements on reconstruction quality. Improved performance with the proposed DE based demodulation is also demonstrated.",

Low power consumption will be achieved by utilizing a wake-up radio concept which enables to keep the most power consuming devices at the sleep mode as long as possible. A WSN OpenAPI gateway (WOAG) component of the architecture supports high scalability by enabling data collection and sharing from networks deployed using multiple different technologies. WOAG facilitates WSNs information availability to local and remote end-users. Analytical energy efficiency optimization model for the architecture is developed. Results show energy efficiency gains that can be achieved with the proposed wake-up concept based intelligent hierarchical architecture design. For low event frequency case the energy efficiency is found to be one order of magnitude better than for duty cycle (1 {\%}) radio based network.",

abstract="The change in the DNA is a form of genetic variation in the human genome. In addition, the DNA copy number change is also linked with the progression of many emerging diseases. Array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is considered as a major task when measuring the DNA copy number change across the genome. Moreover, DNA copy number change is an essential measure to diagnose the cancer disease. Next generation sequencing is an important method for studying the spread of infectious disease qualitatively and quantitatively. CGH is widely used in continuous monitoring of copy number of thousands of genes throughout the genome. In recent years, the size of the DNA sequence data is very large. Hence, there is a need to use a scalable machine learning approach to overcome the various issues in DNA copy number change detection. In this paper, we use a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian Mixture (GM) Clustering approach to model the DNA copy number change across the genome. The proposed Bayesian HMM with GM Clustering approach is compared with various existing approaches such as Pruned Exact Linear Time method, binary segmentation method and segment neighborhood method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed change detection algorithm.",

They are used for many applications: from wireless building automation to e-health applications. However, due to the limited capabilities of sensor nodes, designing network protocols for these constrained devices is currently very challenging. Therefore, this paper presents the IDRA platform: an information driven architecture designed to support next-generation applications on resource constrained networked objects. IDRA supports simple but useful optimizations at an architectural level. These include support for cross-protocol interactions, energy efficiency optimizations, QoS optimizations (packet priorities, dynamic protocol selection), mobility support and heterogeneous network support. The paper shows how the development of protocols is improved by using an architecture which delegates specific tasks to a central system, decreasing the memory requirements of associated network protocols. A thorough experimental performance analysis demonstrates that IDRA is much more scalable in terms of memory requirements, energy requirements and processing overhead than traditional system architectures. Finally, the paper discusses how the optimizations presented in this paper can be used for the clean-slate design of architectures for other wireless or wired network types.",

The concerned literature to date focuses on manufacturing technology selection by being either part specific or application specific. As multiple criteria are involved for decision making, this paper provides a thorough review on the following questions: (1) What are the common design criteria used in literature for additive and traditional manufacturing technologies with respect to product-process integration? (2) What is the literature contribution for material and manufacturing process selection strategies with special focus on comparison of additive and traditional manufacturing technologies? The paper attempts to provide as a result a basic generic methodology for resource selection (RS) which will not only take into account all of the areas of application, DFM/DFAM guidelines, and three design criteria (function, cost, and environment), but will also discuss avenues for collaborative product development.

Through analysis of the latest HDFS, we first present five problems caused by its metadata management and derive three requirements of robustness, availability, and scalability for resolving these problems. We then design an overall architecture of the advanced HDFS, A-HDFS, which satisfies these requirements. In particular, we define functional modules according to HDFS operations and also present the detailed design strategy for adding or modifying the individual components in the corresponding modules. Finally, through implementation of the proposed A-HDFS, we validate its correctness by experimental evaluation and also show that A-HDFS satisfies all the requirements. The proposed A-HDFS significantly enhances the HDFS metadata management scheme and, as a result, ensures that the entire system improves its stability, availability, and scalability. Thus, we can exploit the improved distributed file system based on A-HDFS for various fields and, in addition, we can expect more applications to be actively developed.",

abstract="The huge amount of sensory data collected from mobile devices has offered great potentials to promote more significant services based on user data extracted from sensor readings. However, releasing user data could also seriously threaten user privacy. It is possible to directly collect sensitive information from released user data without user permissions. Furthermore, third party users can also infer sensitive information contained in released data in a latent manner by utilizing data mining techniques. In this paper, we formally define these two types of threats as inherent data privacy and latent data privacy and construct a data-sanitization strategy that can optimize the tradeoff between data utility and customized two types of privacy. The key novel idea lies that the developed strategy can combat against powerful third party users with broad knowledge about users and launching optimal inference attacks. We show that our strategy does not reduce the benefit brought by user data much, while sensitive information can still be protected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that preserves both inherent data privacy and latent data privacy.",

abstract="The food intelligent packaging (IP) technologies are reviewed with a particular emphasis on the possibilities of radiofrequency identification (RFID) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) technologies for developing the food IP concept. Passive RFID and SAW technologies are the more promising ones to achieve a food IP that can wirelessly communicate the food quality to the different agents of the food chain. However, some drawbacks and cost of these technologies are limiting their massive use in food IP. This is the reason why a lot of research works are being currently performed that focus on increasing functionality (e.g., enabling the tag antenna as a sensing device) and reducing costs of components and materials of these RFID and SAW systems. Furthermore, benefits can be also achieved by means of integrating the RFID, SAW, and other sensing technologies. The RFID and SAW technologies can be embedded in a wireless sensor network (WSN), and the corresponding tags and readers can build more intelligent networks by sharing the sensing, logic, and transmission capabilities of the sensor networks. The above two technologies can be integrated in two different ways: sensor-enabled tags---RFID or SAW (or RFID or SAW sensor tags)---and RFID and/or SAW-embedded WSN. The application of these technologies on secondary packages, as the paperboard packages, can dilute the costs of application on primary packaging and allow the massive use of these technologies in the food supply chain.",

We also investigated the dependence of analyte overlap integral (also called fill fraction) of the resonant mode as well as the effect of group index of the coupling waveguide at the resonant wavelength of the microcavity. In addition to the cavity properties, absorbance of the sensing medium or analyte together with the affinity constant of the probe and target biomarkers involved in the biochemical reaction also limits the minimum detection limits.

abstract="Advanced sensing and internet of things bring the big data, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for data-driven knowledge discovery. However, it is common that a large number of variables (or predictors, features) are involved in the big data. Complex interdependence structures among variables pose significant challenges on the traditional framework of predictive modeling. This paper presents a new methodology of self-organizing network to characterize the interrelationships among variables and cluster them into homogeneous subgroups for predictive modeling. Specifically, we develop a new approach, namely nonlinear coupling analysis to measure variable-to-variable interdependence structures. Further, each variable is represented as a node in the complex network. Nonlinear-coupling forces move these nodes to derive a self-organizing topology of the network. As such, variables are clustered into sub-network communities. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms traditional variable clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and oblique principal component analysis, but also effectively identifies interdependent structures among variables and further improves the performance of predictive modeling. Additionally, real-world case study shows that the proposed method yields an average sensitivity of 96.80{\%} and an average specificity of 92.62{\%} in the identification of myocardial infarctions using sparse parameters of vectorcardiogram representation models. The proposed new idea of self-organizing network is generally applicable for predictive modeling in many disciplines that involve a large number of highly-redundant variables.",

journal="The Journal of Supercomputing",

month="Jan",
day="29",
abstract="Recently, the diverse virtual reality devices are developed and utilized. Particularly, the devices that recognize the motions of users such as griping hands and opening hands are issued to utilize the motions of the users as input methodology. Traditional research about motion recognition suggests user's motion estimation methods by calculating Bayesian probability after measuring the orientation of the motions by a Myo, which is one of contact-type motion recognition devices. However, the motion estimation methods have the problem of low motion estimation accuracy, given that orientation is defined by x, y, and z, which are calculated separately only considering the values of the corresponding axis. In order to improve motion estimation accuracy, motions should be estimated by considering the values of all axis. This paper proposes a method using genetic algorithm to calculate weights, which are applied to estimate motions through Bayesian probability by considering the values of all axis after measuring user's motions with a Myo. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, the Bayesian probability is calculated by considering the correlations of x, y, and z of the orientation of a Myo. Second, weights are determined by applying genetic algorithm. Third, motions are estimated through the Bayesian probability with the determined weights. Experiments were conducted to compare the Bayesian probability between the traditional method based on min/max and the proposed method, which showed that the proposed method had reduced the difference of the orientations by 32{\%}.",

abstract="For the purpose of accurate diagnosis and early treatment for cancers, the classification and identification of different tumors is the key problem of computer-aided diagnosis system. In this paper, an improved semi-supervised tumor identification method is proposed, which takes advantage of the Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and offers a pathological degree tree based on ten three-dimentional (3-D) and two dimentional(2-D) tumor features. In addition, a great deal of complicated data processing is distributed in the fog computing architecture. First, we carry out the segmentation of tumors by using FRFCM algorithm, and complete the 3-D modeling. Then, the pathological shape features of 3-D and 2-D tumors are extracted from modeling, for constructing a group of feature vector. Finally, based on the landmark information of labeled samples provided by standard database and experts, we realize an improved semi-supervised FCM clustering to guide the tumor identification. The experiments are conducted by using medical CT scans of 143 patients including 452 tumors. Overall, the best average identification accuracy of                                                                   {\$}{\$}94.6{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                                                                            94.6                      {\%}                                                                     has been recorded for this proposed method, the ability of machine learning to recognize the benign, malignant and false-positive tumors is improved effectively under imbalanced data sets.",

Our increasing dependence on ubiquitous computing creates an urgent need for modelling and verification technologies to support the design process, and hence improve the reliability and reduce production costs.

journal="Universal Access in the Information Society",

abstract="An increasing percentage of the population needs assistance services for a wide range of activities related to their independent living, which can be delivered either by humans or by machines. While cloud computing and emerging ICT solutions have introduced new types of services and service delivery paradigms, it remains costly and difficult to set up and market assistance services addressing the needs of very narrow end-user groups. The current work presents the design of a novel open-source infrastructure (web-based platform) which enables diverse stakeholders to easily set up web-based assistance-on-demand platform instances. Each of these AoD instances can be used by service providers to register and offer assistance-on-demand (AoD) services for catering individual needs of persons with disabilities. In this way, narrow end-user groups can be reached and enjoy a gamut of assistance services. The AoD platform is implemented in the context of a larger Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), which is being developed in the context of the Prosperity4All project. The functional requirements for the design of the AoD infrastructure were iteratively fine-tuned through the definition and analysis of representative use models (sets of personas and use cases). The AoD platform architecture consists of two major components: front-end (GUI) and back-end (service infrastructure). Their implementation is mainly based on the Django framework which enables a Model--Template--View (MTV) software architectural pattern with highly configurable and flexible components. The evaluation of a demonstration instance of the AoD platform with end-users identified its advantages and pointed out additional functionality needed: multi-language, multi-modality, embedded social media feeding, dedicated menu for highly flexible service, etc. The overall perceived usefulness of the specific demonstration AoD platform instance that underwent evaluation was higher than 80{\%}. The proposed AoD platform provides a flexible and sufficiently generic web-based infrastructure for the cost-effective setup, registration and web publication of services that can accommodate a highly diverse range of assistance needs. Furthermore, it is suitable for use by a wide range of different stakeholder/user groups interested in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities or otherwise at risk of exclusion.",

Over the past decade, the AAL domain has evolved at a fast pace in various directions. The stakeholders of AAL are not only limited to patients, but also include their relatives, social services, health workers, and care agencies. In fact, AAL aims at increasing the life quality of patients, their relatives and the health care providers with a holistic approach. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the AAL domain, presenting a systematic analysis of over 10 years of relevant literature focusing on the stakeholders' needs, bridging the gap of existing reviews which focused on technologies. The findings of this review clearly show that until now the AAL domain neglects the view of the entire AAL ecosystem. Furthermore, the proposed solutions seem to be tailored more on the basis of the available existing technologies, rather than supporting the various stakeholders' needs. Another major lack that this review is pointing out is a missing adequate evaluation of the various solutions. Finally, it seems that, as the domain of AAL is pretty new, it is still in its incubation phase. Thus, this review calls for moving the AAL domain to a more mature phase with respect to the research approaches.",

abstract="Movement detection is gaining more and more attention among various pattern recognition problems. Recognizing human movement activity types is extremely useful for fall detection for elderly people. Wireless sensor network technology enables human motion data from wearable wireless sensor devices be transmitted for remote processing. This paper studies methods to process the human motion data received from wearable wireless sensor devices for detecting different types of human movement activities such as sitting, standing, lying, fall, running, and walking. Machine learning methods K Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) and the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm are used to classify the activities from the data acquired from sensors based on sample data. As there are a large amount of real-time raw data received from sensors and there are noises associated with these data, feature construction and reduction are used to preprocess these raw sensor data obtained from accelerometers embedded in wireless sensing motes for learning and processing. The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is used for constructing the enriched features. The enriched features are then integrated with machine learning algorithms for movement detection. The testing data are collected from five adults. Experimental results show that our methods can achieve promising performance on human movement recognition and fall detection.",

abstract="Based on the concept of data physicalization, we developed Vital + Morph, an interactive surface for remote connection and awareness of clinical data. It enables users located in remote places to monitor and feel the vital signs measured from a hospitalized person through shape-change. We propose shape-changing interfaces as a way of making data physicalization a richer, intriguing and memorable experience that communicates complex information and insights about data. To demonstrate and validate our proposed concept, we developed an exploratory study about the design and its implications. For evaluating the social impact of shape-changing interfaces in the context of remote monitoring, we presented Vital + Morph in several Media Art festivals. We collected and analyzed the feedback from the visitors during the exhibitions, and discussed the possibilities of the proposed system. A preliminary evaluation shows how shape-changing displays are perceived by users, which establishes not only the potential benefits but also highlights the concerns that several users have raised. Through this study, we aim to contribute to the design of remote monitoring systems by providing a novel approach for displaying clinical data that consider the richness of the physical world. In today's information-driven society, we should not just focus on how abstract data are collected and analyzed, but also on how it can be presented and incorporated into our daily lives.",

abstract="The field of machine vision is continuously evolving. There are new products coming into the market that have very severe size, weight and power constraints and handle very high computational loads simultaneously. Existing architectures and digital image processing solutions will not be able to meet these ever-increasing demands. There is a need to develop novel architectures and image processing solutions to address these requirements. The major contribution of this work is to show that analog signal processing is a solution to this problem. The analog processor will be used as an augmentation device which works in parallel with the digital processor, making the system faster and more efficient. We have developed a prototype of an analog processing board using commercially available off-the-shelf components and demonstrated that a prototype development has several advantages over a direct integrated circuit design. We focus on providing experimental results that demonstrate functionality of the analog processing board and show that the performance of the prototype board for low-level and mid-level image processing tasks is equivalent to a digital implementation. To demonstrate improvement in speed and power consumption over other systems, we propose an integrated circuit design of the analog processor and show that such an analog processor would be 100{\texttimes} faster than existing FPGAs and 5{\texttimes} faster than state-of-the-art GPUs. We also compare the performance of the proposed integrated circuit design against other analog processors reported in the literature. We report a case study in which we use the processor for an object detection and recognition application and show that the processor has excellent performance.",

abstract="Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a promising wireless network technology, in the context of body area network (BAN) applications, to provide the required quality of service support concerning the communication between sensor nodes placed on a user's body and a personal device, such as a smartphone. Most previous BLE performance studies in the literature have focused primarily in networks with a single slave (point-to-point link) or traffic scenarios with relatively low data rate. However, many BAN sensors generate high data rate traffic, and several sensor nodes (slaves) may be actively sending data in the same BAN. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of the suitability of BLE mainly under these conditions. Results show that, for the same traffic, the BLE protocol presents lower energy consumption and supports more sensor nodes than an alternative IEEE 802.15.4-based protocol. This study also identifies and characterizes some implementation constraints on the tested platforms that impose limits on the achievable performance.",

abstract="Smart city has been greatly promoted by the adoption of information and communication technology. At the same time, data integrity becomes an urgent necessity in cloud storage scenario. When smart city meets cloud, if the data are damaged or corrupted, it will be a serious security loophole of smart city. Recently, numerous remote data auditing (RDA) protocols have been presented, among which Sookhak et al. put forward a dynamic remote data auditing protocol to deal with this major concern. In this paper, we found that this protocol has inherent security flaws, thus fails to achieve its original goal. Specifically, this protocol is vulnerable to two types of attacks, namely replace attack and replay attack. We show the details that how a malicious server can deceive data owners to believe that the data are maintained well by launching such attacks. Then, we describe an improved RDA protocol with provable security by utilizing algebraic signature to fix those security flaws. We employ the rank-based Merkle Hash Tree to achieve verifiable dynamic data operations for our RDA protocol. We also provide detailed security proof of the proposed RDA protocol.",

Due to the diverse number of possible applications, a flexible system architecture, which includes several different system versions, is proposed. Operation of the system is driven by user gestures. To demonstrate the concept of the proposed real-time biofeedback training system, an application for golf swing training is developed. The application implements the system using smartphone motion sensors and audio biofeedback and aids golfers in correcting unwanted head movements during a golf swing. The application is driven by a gesture user interface. During the golf swing, the application provides users with real-time audio feedback that signals head movement errors.

In this paper, we propose a distributed location-aware access control mechanism and its application in the smart building context. Our approach is based on an access control engine embedded into smart objects, which are responsible to make authorization decisions by considering both user location data and access credentials. User location data are estimated using a novel indoor localization system based on magnetic field data sent by user through her personal phone. This localization system implements a combination of soft computing techniques over the data collected by smartphones. Therefore, our location-aware access control mechanism does not require any intermediate entity, providing the benefits of a decentralized approach for smart environments. From the results obtained, we can consider our proposal as a promising approach to tackle the challenging security requirements of typical pervasive environments.",

On purpose to realize an intelligent unattended alerting for disease-pest of fruit-melon, this paper presents the convolutional neural network (CNN) for recognition of fruit-melon skin lesion image which is real-timely acquired by an infrared video sensor, which network is grounded upon so-called momentum deep learning rule. More specifically, (1) a suite of transformation methods of apple skin lesion image is devised to simulate orientation and light disturbance which always occurs in orchards, then to output a self-contained set of almost all lesion images which might appear in various dynamic sensing environment; and (2) the rule of variable momentum learning is formulated to update the free parameters of CNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed presents a satisfying accuracy and recall rate which are up to 97.5 {\%}, 98.5 {\%} respectively. As compared with some shallow learning algorithms and generally accepted deep learning ones, it also offers a gratifying smoothness, stableness after convergence and a quick converging speed. In addition, the statistics from experiments of different benchmark data-sets suggests it is very effective to recognize image pattern.",

Based on Hadoop distributed architecture and MapReduce parallel computing model, big volume and variety quality related data generated during the manufacturing process could be dealt with. Artificial intelligent algorithms, including Bayesian network learning, classification and reasoning, are embedded into the Reduce process. Relying on the ability of the Bayesian network in dealing with dynamic and uncertain problem and the parallel computing power of MapReduce, Bayesian network of impact factors on quality are built based on prior probability distribution and modified with posterior probability distribution. A case study on hull segment manufacturing precision management for ship and offshore platform building shows that computing speed accelerates almost directly proportionally to the increase of computing nodes. It is also proved that the proposed model is feasible for locating and reasoning of root causes, forecasting of manufacturing outcome, and intelligent decision for precision problem solving. The integration of bigdata analytics and BN method offers a whole new perspective in manufacturing quality control.",

The intervention of a centralized key manager is avoided with this technique. To improve the security in multicast environments, GKMP effectively combines region-clustering approach based on the theory of hyper sphere and re-encryption using projective geometry. This forms a region based cluster protocol. Security is handled in an effective way through digital signature technique namely EdDSA and projective geometry. This paper concentrates on applying the intelligent security algorithm over the group controller in a distributed environment. The comparison with conventional techniques prove that the proposed algorithm outperforms well in terms of improved security and reduced overhead in multicast environments.

These devices are able to provide services to individuals; however, they also collect huge amount of personal information which may be used to infer sensitive private information. Among these personal devices, fitness trackers have the potential to capture the most personal user information. We conducted an analysis on fitness trackers and built a case study based on Fitbit wearables, its Android application, and the third party applications that provide further services by accessing Fitbit data and exchanging data with its application, given the user's permission. Specifically, we analyzed the case of Lose It! third party application. Then, we applied a framework for user privacy protection in the IoT, which we have defined in our previous work, to this specific case and validated our design choices using controlled experiments. The contribution of the paper is twofold: showing the risks for privacy due to the possible correlation of shared data to infer undisclosed personal information and presenting an approach to support users in managing privacy configuration settings. The ultimate aim of this study is to outline new challenges for IoT development by (i) emphasizing the need to protect users against inference attacks coming from the supposedly trusted third parties and (ii) making the process of information sharing more informative and the users more aware of the related risks.",

We draw parallels between the socialist calculation debate and nudge theoretical arguments, particularly the libertarian socialism of H. D. Dickinson and the libertarian paternalism of Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler. We find that if actual idealized behavior is a more complicated process of recursive feedback using a knowledge classification method, behavioral paternalists engaging in an automatized process of notice-and-comment rulemaking using Big Data methods still encounter epistemological problems and the problems associated with radical uncertainty unearthed during the socialist calculation debate and afterwards.",

Their work have shown that it is possible to inject a Trojan in a random number generator compliant with FIPS 140-2 and NIST SP800-90 standards by exploiting non-zero aliasing probability of Logic Built-In-Self-Test (LBIST). In this paper, we present two methods for modifying LBIST to prevent such an attack. The first method makes test patterns dependent on a configurable key which is programed into a chip after the manufacturing stage. The second method uses a remote test management system which can execute LBIST using a different set of test patterns at each test cycle.",

abstract="Advanced learning technologies are reaching a new phase of their evolution where they are finally entering mainstream educational contexts, with persistent user bases. However, as AIED scales, it will need to follow recent trends in service-oriented and ubiquitous computing: breaking AIED platforms into distinct services that can be composed for different platforms (web, mobile, etc.) and distributed across multiple systems. This will represent a move from learning platforms to an ecosystem of interacting learning tools. Such tools will enable new opportunities for both user-adaptation and experimentation. Traditional macro-adaptation (problem selection) and step-based adaptation (hints and feedback) will be extended by meta-adaptation (adaptive system selection) and micro-adaptation (event-level optimization). The existence of persistent and widely-used systems will also support new paradigms for experimentation in education, allowing researchers to understand interactions and boundary conditions for learning principles. New central research questions for the field will also need to be answered due to these changes in the AIED landscape.",

abstract="The term ``information'' has become a universal and omnipresent keyword in almost all areas of our modern world---be it in science or society in general. This is not only obvious from the naming of whole scientific branches like Information Theory, Information Science or Informatics but even more from common speaking---characterising our present time and society as information age viz. information society. However, what ``information'' might mean, is by no means clear and there is a wide range of interpretations covering, among others, its technical, communicational, educational, mental, and scientific aspects. But is the use of the same term justified when adopted in Biology, Physics, Archaeology, Law, Communication Technology, and Informatics (to list just a few of the involved scientific branches) or do its different uses at least have some common characteristics---some sort of common denominator? Is information natural, e.g. manifesting itself as a material phenomenon residing in organisms, stars, atoms, or genes, or is it just a cultural product of human communication, thinking, and interpretation? In this article, we try to clarify some of the most important interpretations, discuss and contrast them with the Informatics point of view. Interpretations range from taking information as material, transferable signals (following Shannon's Information Theory or the genetic approaches), treating it as a sign (following a semiotic approach), as a commercial product (now common in Web-based Information Business) to considering it a pure mental phenomenon bound to humans or human-like individuals or even to groups and societies. Based on these interpretations, we shall throw a critical glance on current trends in human science and society---focusing on the now popular concept of ``information society''---and then derive some theses and guidelines for further research escorting the growth and dispersal of information technology. As it will turn out, an information society which defines itself through the number of computers, internet connections and network links is based on a very narrow, techno-centric concept of information. However, a reflection on the educational and cultural aspects of information might lead to a better-qualified society consisting of responsible and critical citizens.",

FTrack uses the mobile phone's sensors only without any infrastructure support. It does not require any prior knowledge of the building such as floor height or floor levels. Through crowdsourcing, FTrack builds a mapping table which contains the magnetic field signature of users taking the elevator/escalator or walking on the stairs between any two floors. The table can then be used for mobile users to pinpoint their current floor levels. We conduct both simulation and field studies to demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and robustness of FTrack.

In view of the contribution of features to clustering, feature weights which can be updated automatically during the clustering procedure are introduced to calculate the distance between each pair of data points, hence the improved versions of KHM and fuzzy KHM are proposed. Furthermore, the Lab color space, local homogeneity and texture are utilized to establish the feature vector to be more applicable for color image segmentation. The feature group weighting strategy is introduced to identify the importance of different types of features. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed feature group weighted KHM-type algorithms can achieve better segmentation performances, and they can effectively distinguish the importance of different features to clustering.",

abstract="This paper presents the full VLSI implementation of a new high-resolution depth-sensing system on a chip (SoC) based on active infrared structured light, which estimates the 3D scene depth by matching randomized speckle patterns, akin to the Microsoft Kinect. We present a module to enhance the consistency of speckle patterns for robust matching, and hence improve the range of depth estimation. We present a simple and efficient hardware structure for a block-matching-based disparity estimation algorithm, which facilitates rapid generation of disparity maps in real time. For depth estimation from disparity maps, we propose a hardware friendly solution by producing a lookup table from a curve fitted to calculate and calibrate the depth value in a single step, which does not need to explicitly calibrate the parameters of the imaging sensors, such as the length of the baseline. We have implemented these ideas in an end-to-end SoC using FPGA.

A mixed integer programming model is developed for the studied problem, and its objective is to minimize the makespan. In addition, the structural properties of the problem are analyzed. A hybrid algorithm combining the merits of discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve this problem.

abstract="Some of the recent attempts for improving and transforming engineering education are reviewed. The attempts aim at providing the entry level engineers with the skills needed to address the challenges of future large-scale complex systems and projects. Some of the frontier sectors and future challenges for engineers are outlined. The major characteristics of the coming intelligence convergence era (the post-information age) are identified. These include the prevalence of smart devices and environments, the widespread applications of anticipatory computing and predictive / prescriptive analytics, as well as a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. Devices and machines will be able to learn from, and with, humans in a natural collaborative way. The recent game changers in learnscapes (learning paradigms, technologies, platforms, spaces, and environments) that can significantly impact engineering education in the coming era are identified. Among these are open educational resources, knowledge-rich classrooms, immersive interactive 3D learning, augmented reality, reverse instruction / flipped classroom, gamification, robots in the classroom, and adaptive personalized learning. Significant transformative changes in, and mass customization of, learning are envisioned to emerge from the synergistic combination of the game changers and other technologies. The realization of the aforementioned vision requires the development of a new multidisciplinary framework of emergent engineering for relating innovation, complexity and cybernetics, within the future learning environments. The framework can be used to treat engineering education as a complex adaptive system, with dynamically interacting and communicating components (instructors, individual, small, and large groups of learners). The emergent behavior resulting from the interactions can produce progressively better, and continuously improving, learning environment. As a first step towards the realization of the vision, intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystems need to be developed to facilitate collaboration between the various stakeholders of engineering education, and to accelerate the development of a skilled engineering workforce. The major components of the ecosystems include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities, blended learning and research spaces, novel ultra-intelligent software agents, multimodal and autonomous interfaces, and networked cognitive and tele-presence robots.",

The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is the most common classification algorithm in cases of no prior knowledge of data distribution. In the paper, an improved KNN algorithm was proposed to cope with the human performance prediction problem with the improvements in three aspects, which are the neighboring distance calculation based on entropy, the classification determination strategy, and the quantitative description method of human performance. The improved KNN algorithm was proved to have better classification ability in comparison with other seven typical KNN algorithms and five classic classification algorithms using data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository.

abstract="This article revisits and uses the so-called U-Commerce framework to challenge financial services marketing decision makers to consider reformulating marketing objectives in an age of ubiquitous technological networks. It outlines the 4 U's of U-Commerce -- ubiquity, universality, unison and uniqueness, and revisits the original framework used to conceptualize U-Commerce. Then it identifies and describes four broad marketing objectives that financial services marketers can strive for, including amplification, attenuation, contextualization and transcension. Four broad marketing strategies can be used to achieve these objectives, namely nexus marketing, sync marketing, immersion marketing and transcension marketing. Examples specific to financial services marketing are used to illustrate and discuss these strategies.",

abstract="Interest in Citizen Science has grown significantly over the last decade. Much of this interest can be traced to the provision of sophisticated platforms that enable seamless collaboration, cooperation and coordination between professional and amateur scientists. In terms of field research, smart-phones have been widely adopted, automating data collection and enriching observations with photographs, sound recordings and GPS coordinates using embedded sensors hosted on the device itself. Interaction with external sensor platforms such as those normally used in the environmental monitoring domain is practically null-existent. Remedying this deficiency would have positive ramifications for both the professional and citizen science communities. To illustrate the relevant issues, this paper considers a common problem, that of data collection in sparse sensor networks, and proposes a practical solution that would enable citizen scientists act as Human Relays thus facilitating the collection of data from such networks. Broader issues necessary for enabling intelligent sensing using common smart-phones and embedded sensing technologies are then discussed.",

abstract="Wireless multimedia sensor networks are involved with rate-adaptive applications, such as video, audio and image, therefore, high bandwidth or throughput is demanded. To maximize the system throughput of the network, a channel access mechanism based on evolutionary game is proposed. Under the mechanism, users are assumed to be bounded rationality, in order to coordinate users' behavior in distributed manner, a new reward function is deduced. On the basis of the reward function, a dynamic channel access algorithm and corresponding dynamic equation are designed for the mechanism, which converge to Nash Equilibrium with faster speed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the reward function proposed can realize the maximization of system throughput and higher normalized utilities of users under the framework of evolutionary game, and the corresponding dynamic equation is globally asymptotically stable, besides, when user deviates because of bounded rationality, the dynamic equation is still able to guarantee faster convergence and smaller performance deviation.",

abstract="To solve the problem of unreasonable distribution of cluster heads in wireless sensor network (WSN) clustering routing methods, as well as to optimize data transferring between clusters, the novel predictive efficient energy consumption reclaim (PEECR)-based clustering routing approach for wireless sensor network has been presented in this paper. On how to select cluster head, a new energy-efficient clustering method based on degree, relative distance and residual energy of nodes is designed, which guarantees that distribution of cluster heads is uniform, scale of clusters is balanced, and nodes with high energy act as cluster head preferentially. By using swarm colony optimization idea, we design PEECR strategy for data transferring. A predictive data transferring strategy between clusters is designed. Taking expected energy consumption on a road, hops and propagation delay into account, definition of good ratio of a road is given, according to which we choose optimal road. In reception mode, energy consumption of transceivers from source node to sink node of wireless sensor network is similar to energy consumption from sink node to source node, and both can be minimized by our approach. Our experimental tests show that novel optimized clustering routing approach can improve quality of clusters and whole performance of network, reduce and balance energy consumption of the whole network, and prolong lifetime of WSN as well.",

However, there is no uniform and clear understanding of the essence, characteristics, infrastructure and application of e-Geoscience. This paper first discusses and analyzes the development of e-Science in a global context and then explores its development in China. Next, the development of e-Geoscience is discussed, particularly regarding the details of its design and implementation in China, including a conceptual model, a mode of application, a logical hierarchy, and functional and technical systems. Finally, the paper introduces a typical application, called the Northeast Asia Joint Scientific Exploration and Cooperative Research Platform (NAJSECRP), which is operating in research institutions in China, Russia and Mongolia. This platform can not only provide geodata and bibliographies and promote resource sharing but also provides a collaborative research platform for scientific exploration. In practice, this platform has been shown to save costs and improve the efficiency of transnational, interdisciplinary scientific exploration and cooperative research.",

However, security in D2D communications, which is essential for the success of D2D services, has not yet been seriously studied in the literature. In this paper, we explore a security architecture for D2D communications under the framework of 3GPP LTE. We further investigate potential security threats and specify security requirements accordingly. Existing security solutions in D2D communications are seriously surveyed and evaluated based on the specified security architecture and requirements in order to figure out open research issues and motivate future research efforts.",

From the perspective of ethics---both of the special fields of ethics like animal ethics, information ethics and technology ethics and of machine ethics which can be understood as a counterpart to human ethics---advanced driver assistance systems raise various questions. The aim of this paper is to derive suggestions from animal ethics and other disciplines for the improvement and development of the systems.

The result is that there are many possibilities to expand existing systems and to develop new functions in the context with the aim to reduce the number of animal victims.",

The secure multiparty computation (SMC)-based privacy-preserving data mining has emerged as a solution to this problem. However, there is heavy computation cost at user side in traditional SMC solutions. This study introduces an outsourcing method to reduce the computation cost of the user side. We also preserve the privacy of the shared databy proposing an outsourced privacy-preserving C4.5 algorithm over horizontally and vertically partitioned data for multiple parties based on the outsourced privacy preserving weighted average protocol (OPPWAP) and outsourced secure set intersection protocol (OSSIP). Consequently, we have found that our method can achieve a result same the original C4.5 decision tree algorithm while preserving data privacy. Furthermore, we also implement the proposed protocols and the algorithms. It shows that a sublinear relationship exists between the computational cost of the user side and the number of participating parties.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are augmented with sensing and communication technologies to support elderly people with personalized, adaptive and anticipatory requirements. A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environment's functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment. To deal with these issues, we introduce a contExt Aware web Service dEscription Language (wEASEL) that is an abstract service model to represent services and user tasks in AAL environments. Also, we present a set of wEASEL-based service matching algorithms and evaluate them for their suitability. The proposed service matchmaking mechanism can incorporate services that are available in local AAL environment as well as in the cloud computing marketplace.",

As a result, we observe a wide variety of provenance types and provenance-generating methods. This survey provides an overview of the research field of provenance, focusing on what provenance is used for (what for?), what types of provenance have been defined and captured for the different applications (what form?), and which resources and system requirements impact the choice of deploying a particular provenance solution (what from?). For each of these three key questions, we provide a classification and review the state of the art for each class. We conclude with a summary and possible future research challenges.",

abstract="Computational technologies have become increasingly pervasive in recent decades. Computing research in academia has commensurately seen dramatic increases, both in computing-specific research and research using computing. This article maps out the academic computing landscape by examining the connections between computing-related keywords used to describe theses and dissertations. Specifically, data from 29,435 dissertations and theses found in the ProQuest Theses and Dissertation database in the years 2009--2014 were analyzed. Results identify interdisciplinary clusters, as well as identify key differences in connections between the four computing disciplines in the database: computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), information technology (IT), and information science (ISci). For example, authors who primarily identify with CS rarely list secondary keywords, while authors from a high variety of other disciplines list CS as a secondary keyword. CE is tightly focused and growing, but rarely seen as a relevant secondary keyword by other fields. Meanwhile, the highly interdisciplinary nature of IT and ISci is shown, along with different subgroups within those areas. While the total number of unique theses with computing-related keywords has remained steady, they have shifted dramatically between specific computing fields (e.g., away from CS toward CE and IT). Visualizations present information on the growth and change in focus of computing-related theses and dissertations, as well as networks of keywords that co-occur. We discuss potential explanations of the patterns, as well as their implications on the future of graduate work in computing disciplines.",

abstract="Smart meters are needed for realizing energy savings and automatic meter reading. As smart meters used for the gas or water supply infrastructure cannot always receive supplied power, a low-power-consumption communication protocol for battery-powered smart meters is required. The U-Bus Air protocol is standardized for gas meters in mid- and high-rise buildings. U-Bus Air has the features of low power consumption using time asynchronous communication and multi-hop communication among nodes. However, the interference power increases as the number of nodes increases. In order to solve the problem, intermittent receiver-driven data transmission media access control (IRDT-MAC) was proposed; it finds the appropriate transmission cycle (intermittent interval); the communication performance is improved using the derivation of the collision probability. On the other hand, IRDT-MAC cannot correspond to a change of link topology. In this paper, we propose a protocol for controlling the receiver beacon transmission interval using the fusion center (FC) for solving the above problem. In this protocol, the link topology of each smart meter is sent to the FC and the FC calculates the suitable transmission cycle for this specific topology. Finally, the suitable transmission cycle is fed back to each node from the FC. Using computer simulations, improvements of the packet delivery ratio (PDR), the throughput, and the power consumption are confirmed in two topologies. Specifically, the improvements are confirmed in the case of two stages or more in the building-wide square topology.",

abstract="This paper has two distinct but related goals: (1) to identify some of the potential consequences of the Internet for our cognitive abilities and (2) to suggest an approach to evaluate these consequences. I begin by outlining the Google effect, which (allegedly) shows that when we know information is available online, we put less effort into storing that information in the brain. Some argue that this strategy is adaptive because it frees up internal resources which can then be used for other cognitive tasks, whereas others argue that this is maladaptive because it makes us less knowledgeable. I argue that the currently available empirical evidence in cognitive psychology does not support strong conclusions about the negative effects of the Internet on memory. Before we can make value-judgements about the cognitive effects of the Internet, we need more robust and ecologically-valid evidence. Having sketched a more nuanced picture of the Google effect, I then argue that the value of our cognitive abilities is in part intrinsic and in part instrumental, that is, they are both valuable in themselves and determined by the socio-cultural context in which these cognitive abilities are utilised. Focussing on instrumental value, I argue that, in an information society such as ours, having the skills to efficiently navigate, evaluate, compare, and synthesize online information are (under most circumstances) more valuable than having a lot of facts stored in biological memory. This is so, partly because using the Internet as an external memory system has overall benefits for education, navigation, journalism, and academic scholarship.",

abstract="In a wireless sensor network (WSN), sink node/base station (BS) gathers data from surrounding nodes and sends them to a remote server via a gateway. BS holds important data. Therefore, it is necessary to hide its location from an inside/outside attacker. Providing BS location anonymity against a local and global adversary, we propose a novel technique called MimiBS ``Mimicking Base-Station''. The key idea is the integration of aggregator nodes (ANs) with sensor nodes (SNs), while fine tuning TTL (time to live) value for fake packets, and setting some threshold value for real packet counter rpctr. MimiBS creates multiple traffic-hotspots (zones), which shifts the focus from BS to the newly created ANs hotspots. Multiple traffic-hotspots confuse the adversary while determining the real BS location information. We defend the BS location information anonymity against traffic analysis attack, and traffic tracing attack. MimiBS gives an illusion of having multiple BSs, and thus, if the attacker knows any about AN, he/she will be deceived between the real BS and ANs. MimiBS outperforms BLAST (base-station location anonymity and security technique), RW (random walk), and SP (shortest path), while conducting routing without fake packets, with fake packets, without energy consideration, and with energy consideration respectively.",

This paper presents such a framework that integrates both a computer vision component and heterogeneous sensors with unanimous semantic representation and interpretation, while it also addresses challenges for realistic applications, such as fast, efficient image analysis and ontology-based temporal interpretation models. The framework is validated through an application in clinical dementia assessment yielding positive results and fruitful conclusions for the proposed semantic fusion of vision and sensor observations.",

abstract="The incorporation of electronics by embedding the relevant sensors in the physical devices in home and office, vehicles of all types, buildings in the smart cities and in all possible spheres of life form a network of devices termed as internet of things (IoT). It is being realized that vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) which are responsible for the reliable and secure communication among vehicles is a primary area of research in IoT and hence ensuring security in this area is essential. Thus, this work introduces a novel approach to improve the existing authentication support to VANETs. In this proposed framework, first an anonymous authentication approach for preserving the privacy is proposed which not only performs the vehicle user's anonymous authentication but preserves the message integrity of the transmitting messages as well. Although many anonymous authentication schemes have been proposed in VANETs until now, the existing schemes suffer from a high computation cost during the signature and certificate verification process which leads to delayed authentication. Consequently, the vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) cannot authenticate more number of vehicles per second in VANETs. Second, an efficient anonymous group key distribution protocol is proposed in this paper for securely distributing the group key to the group of vehicles in the communication range of an RSU. The RSUs can send location based information to the group of vehicles in a secure manner using this group key. Experimental analysis portrays that the results of this new privacy preserving anonymous authentication and key management schemes are promising and efficient with regard to signature verification cost and computational cost in comparison with the existing schemes.",

Introducing learning in such networks can help to dynamically identify good data delivery paths by correlating past actions and results, make intelligent adaptations to improve the network lifetime, and also improve the quality of information delivered by the network to the user. However, there are several factors and limitations that must be considered while choosing a learning strategy. In this paper, we identify some of these factors and explore various learning techniques that have been applied to sensor networks and other applications with similar requirements in the past. We provide our recommendation on the learning strategy based on how well it complements the needs of ICSNs, while keeping in mind the cost, computation, and operational overhead limitations.",

abstract="People are experiencing an evolution of smart cities. Building a smart city will enhance economic competitiveness, social cohesion, and quality of life of its citizens. But smart cities accumulate and process large amount of files, which raises security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. In the case of file sharing in smart cities, security should be considered to embrace file confidentiality, file integrity, receiver privacy, and sender privacy. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving identity-based file sharing (PIFS) scheme to meet these security goals. In PIFS, identity managers for receivers and senders designate them secret keys associated with their identities, respectively. Receivers and senders can register their identities to the group managers without leaking their secret keys. Then a sender can share confidential files with a peer, leaking neither identity of them. However, in case of dispute, the receiver group manager and sender open authority can trace the receiver and the sender, respectively. The security properties of our scheme are formally proven. Analysis shows that our scheme is efficient and practical.",

In this paper we present a Context-aware security framework based on a Traffic Anomaly Detection Indicator (TADI) which indicates when a threat can occur. The main novelty of our approach is that we use as a context the time-based information derived from profile analysis of a typical day to determine more accurately the presence of an anomaly based on the time of day it occurs. This 24-h typical daily analysis helps us to consider the time interval (night-time, working hours, etc.) in which a potential threat occurs, in contrast to traditional sudden peak changes. First, a preliminary analysis based on historical data shows how traffic typically behaves at each particular period of the day. We subsequently calibrate our procedure by checking the effectiveness of different algorithms so that we are aware of which ones gets better performance in each period of the day. Finally the TADI is calculated from the time-based contextual information. We also present the results based on actual traffic traces collected from a campus university that show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The focus is on how ubiquitous technologies have been and can be utilised in developing urban infrastructure, including town planning, street and property maintenance, water supply, public transportation and environmental protection. Such an emerging infrastructure is expected to provide everyone with an opportunity to access urban infrastructure and services with the help of ubiquitous technologies. However, in order to become reality, this requires some kind of democratisation of technology, which is a neglected topic in u-city discourse. It is also important to analyse u-city developments from the point of view of production of space with special reference to the potential colonisation of everyday life. Theoretically speaking, one answer to such compelling questions about the rationale of u-city development can be sought from the idea of the `right to the city', a slogan originally coined by Henri Lefebvre. This approach highlights the importance of involving people to envisioning the future of urban form starting from the perspective of their everyday life.

In addition, to providing an overview of different existing PUF realizations, we introduce a PUF realization aimed at ultra-low cost applications. We then show how the properties of Fuzzy Extractors or Helper Data algorithms can be used to securely deploy secret keys to a low cost wireless node.

For continuous queries where users report their locations periodically, attackers can infer more about users' privacy by analyzing the correlations of their query samples. The causes of path privacy problems, which emerge because the communication by different users in road network using location based services so, attacker can track continuous query information. LBSs, albeit useful and convenient, pose a serious threat to users' path privacy as they are enticed to reveal their locations to LBS providers via their queries for location-based information. Traditional path privacy solutions designed in Euclidean space can be hardly applied to road network environment because of their ignorance of network topological properties. In this paper, we proposed a novel dynamic path privacy protection scheme for continuous query service in road networks. Our scheme also conceals DPP (Dynamic Path Privacy) users' identities from adversaries; this is provided in initiator untraceability property of the scheme. We choose the different attack as our defending target because it is a particularly challenging attack that can be successfully launched without compromising any user or having access to any cryptographic keys. The security analysis shows that the model can effectively protect the user identity anonymous, location information and service content in LBSs. All simulation results confirm that our Dynamic Path Privacy scheme is not only more accurate than the related schemes, but also provide better locatable ratio where the highest it can be around 95 {\%} of unknown nodes those can estimate their position. Furthermore, the scheme has good computation cost as well as communication and storage costs.Simulation results show that Dynamic Path Privacy has better performances compared to some related region based algorithms such as IAPIT scheme, half symmetric lens based localization algorithm (HSL) and sequential approximate maximum a posteriori (AMAP) estimator scheme.",

abstract="The widespread deployment of surveillance cameras has raised serious privacy concerns, and many privacy-enhancing schemes have been recently proposed to automatically redact images of selected individuals in the surveillance video for protection. Of equal importance are the privacy and efficiency of techniques to first, identify those individuals for privacy protection and second, provide access to original surveillance video contents for security analysis. In this paper, we propose an anonymous subject identification and privacy data management system to be used in privacy-aware video surveillance. The anonymous subject identification system uses iris patterns to identify individuals for privacy protection. Anonymity of the iris-matching process is guaranteed through the use of a garbled-circuit (GC)-based iris matching protocol. A novel GC complexity reduction scheme is proposed by simplifying the iris masking process in the protocol. A user-centric privacy information management system is also proposed that allows subjects to anonymously access their privacy information via their iris patterns. The system is composed of two encrypted-domain protocols: The privacy information encryption protocol encrypts the original video records using the iris pattern acquired during the subject identification phase; the privacy information retrieval protocol allows the video records to be anonymously retrieved through a GC-based iris pattern matching process. Experimental results on a public iris biometric database demonstrate the validity of our framework.",

In this paper, we explore whether handoff management can benefit from the pervasiveness of future communication networks. The key idea is to follow the ambient intelligence paradigm for the purpose of context-aware handoff. More precisely, we focus on the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) pervasive technologies, and propose two schemes for handoff prediction at the network layer or at both link and network layers, respectively. Analytical models for their time response and energy consumption are firstly derived. Then simulation-based results show that both of our schemes can achieve 38{\%} to 93{\%} reduction in time response while the second scheme provides 88{\%} energy savings, validating their superiority over the standard solutions.",

abstract="Numerous applications are continuously generating massive amount of data and it has become critical to extract useful information while maintaining acceptable computing performance. The objective of this work is to design an indexing framework which minimizes indexing overhead and improves query execution and data search performance with optimum aggregation of computing performance. We propose SmallClient, an indexing framework to speed up query execution. SmallClient has three modules: block creation, index creation and query execution. Block creation module supports improving data retrieval performance with minimum data uploading overhead. Index creation module allows maximum indexes on a dataset to increase index hit ratio with minimized indexing overhead. Finally, query execution module offers incoming queries to utilize these indexes. The evaluation shows that SmallClient outperforms Hadoop full scan with more than 90{\%} search performance. Meanwhile, indexing overhead of SmallClient is reduced to approximately 50 and 80{\%} for index size and indexing time respectively.",

abstract="In this paper, resource allocation for energy-efficient uplink communications in cognitive small cell networks is studied. We formulate the entire network energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for the joint allocation of small cell base stations (SCBSs), spectrum resources, and transmission power in an open access mode. Since the master optimization problem belong to integer combinatorial fractional program and is essentially NP-hard, we develop a low-complexity alternative as a suboptimal solution by decomposing the master optimization issue into two sub-problems: selection of SCBSs and spectrum resources, and power allocation. The selection sub-problem of SCBSs and spectrum resources for cognitive small cell users (CSCUs) is modeled as a potential game from the viewpoints of reducing system interference and improving received signal strength. We formulate the power allocation sub-problem as a non-cooperative game which can be solved in a distributed fashion. But it is also a non-convex optimization problem in fractional form to solve the optimal power strategies based on maximizing the EE on a specific channel. We transform the nonlinear fractional programming issue into an equivalent parametric programming in subtractive form. For obtaining a social optimum power Nash equilibrium (NE), we propose a novel price-based double-loop iteration algorithm to get the transmission power strategies, which take the form of water-filling structure among different CSCUs over a same channel. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can converge to NE, and polish up the EE of the overall system significantly.",

month="Jan",

volume="24",
number="1",
pages="59--69",
abstract="Error-tolerance has been proposed as a new method to increase effective yield of a system. The basic idea is that faulty chips might be still acceptable as long as their produced errors are insignificant, which is due to the fact that human beings are insensitive to minor variations in sounds, colors and images. It has also been shown that error-tolerance has great applicability to multimedia processing circuits. Based on error-tolerance, if a target chip can have higher error-tolerability, the effective yield (i.e., the fraction of acceptable chips) can become higher. As a result, enhancing error-tolerability of chips is one of the central themes of error-tolerance. This issue, however, has not been addressed in the literature so far. In this work we propose an integrated technique of bit inversion and median filtering to increase the error-tolerability of a chip. We target image processing circuits such as JPEG decoder, and consider faults in the embedded memory in the target circuit. It has been shown that such faults usually induce single-bit errors. Bit inversion is effective to deal with erroneous images when the error rate of a faulty chip is high. The error rate can also thus be reduced. On the other hand, the median filtering is effective to remove errors when the error rate is low. Combining these two methods thus can provide a comprehensive solution. The experimental results for 8000 erroneous images show that by using the proposed technique the error-tolerability can be increased by 52.68 {\%}.",

abstract="With the development of information technology, integrated circuits (IC) and system which target high performance and low power consumption have widely penetrated to all the aspects of national economy, national defense construction and people's life. With the continuous increase in IC integration density, the power consumption is becoming the limiting factor. It turns out that the driving force of the future IC and system development is the reduction of the power consumption and improvement of the performance/power ratio. The Moore's Law is inherently the law for the technology and economic development, and has served as the guideline of the IC development for half a century. However, with the scaling down of IC feature size and the corresponding increased integration density, it is progressively approaching the physical limitation. Moore's Law will gradually complete its historic mission and it will be replaced by a law of reducing the power consumption while ensuring the performance requirements for IC, SoC and SiP performance, law of improving the performance/power ratio. This paper will discuss the related research topics on Green micro/nanoelectronics, including low-power design, novel low-power devices, manufacturing processes for low power applications and related micro/nano electromechanical systems.",

abstract="This study addresses whether augmented reality (AR)-based online wearable guides are better at improving learners' situational interest (with regard to the fields of novelty, challenge, attention demand, exploration intention, instant enjoyment, and total interest) and learning achievement (remembering, understanding, and analyzing) compared with audio guides. This study employed a museum as its research site and examined a total of 96 participants who were randomly divided into two groups: one group using AR-based online wearable guides and the other using audio guides. In the experiment, both groups were required to complete a prior knowledge quiz, a scale of situational interest, and a test of learning achievement, as well as contributing post-activity open-format feedback. The results of this study indicate that situational interest and the remembering dimension of learning achievement have a significant and positive correlation, and that, when compared with the audio guide, the AR-based online wearable guide increased the learners' situational interest and instant enjoyment, as well as the remembering dimension of learning performance. Therefore, the AR-based online wearable guide exhibits the ability to cultivate long-term interest in informal curricula. It is suggested that, when applying AR-based online wearable guides in informal curricula, content difficulty levels should be designed appropriately so that the learners' instant enjoyment, situational interest, and content remembering performance would not be undermined.",

abstract="The expanding networks of information and communication technology (ICT) enabling the connection of places, people and objects shape the reality of urban development nowadays. Although the spread of digitally led urban innovations remains uneven around the world, some places have started a progressive transition towards smart city format. Two dimensions are usually highlighted among the main features of smart urban development. The reliance on the intensive use of ICT to address the most challenging issues of urban planning is emphasised from a technological perspective. On the other hand, a more holistic scenario enhances citizens' inventiveness, collective intelligence and knowledge-based urban development. The impact of ICT on urban development and representation is particularly remarkable when an entire new city is built following a smart city approach. Three relevant examples would be Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD) City in South Korea, Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Skolkovo City in Russian Federation, built to challenge the status quo of urban dynamics. Through a case study approach, this paper explores the most salient features of the place branding strategy of these new smart cities, focussed on creating an exclusive and technology-led business innovation ecosystem for highly skilled residents.",

In this work we present an overview of parametric FP methods that use model-based representations of the survey data.

Within each group we study different approaches and discuss their pros and cons.

Despite mature knowledge, many approaches have been criticized to lack guidance on how to put process improvement into practice. Given the variety of emerging digital technologies, organizations not only face a process improvement black box, but also high uncertainty regarding digital technologies. This paper thus proposes a method that supports organizations in exploiting the digitalization potential of their business processes. To achieve this, action design research and situational method engineering were adopted. Two design cycles involving practitioners (i.e., managers and BPM experts) and end-users (i.e., process owners and participants) were conducted. In the first cycle, the method's alpha version was evaluated by interviewing practitioners from five organizations. In the second cycle, the beta version was evaluated via real-world case studies. In this paper, detailed results of one case study, which was conducted at a semiconductor manufacturer, are included.",

abstract="Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the clustering routing protocols for communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It is based on the assumption that each sensor nodes contain equal amount of energy which is not valid in real scenarios, or the sensor nodes are almost spaced evenly. This paper presents an optimized cluster structure routing method called Dynamic K value LEACH (DK-LEACH), which aims at reducing energy consumption within the uneven energy distributed WSNs. DK-LEACH considers the energy factor of Cluster Heads (CHs) in the phase of clusters formation. Furthermore, the distance between CHs and non-CHs nodes is calculated out, and the proportion of this distance and surplus energy of CHs is adjusted dynamically based on the density of node distribution. Then, the most suitable CHs are chosen by non-CHs to form clusters, which balance energy depletion of CHs effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than LEACH in terms of energy saving and prolongs the network lifetime, the survival rate of nodes improves 8.75{\%} at least compared with LEACH.",

abstract="This article presents a comparative review of systems performing service composition in Ambient Intelligence Environments. Such environments should comply to ubiquitous or pervasive computing guidelines by sensing the user needs or wishes and offering intuitive human-computer interaction and a comfortable non-intrusive experience. To achieve this goal service orientation is widely used and tightly linked with AmI systems. Some of these employ the Web Service technology, which involves well-defined web technologies and standards that facilitate interoperable machine to machine interaction. Other systems regard services of different technologies (e.g. UPnP, OSGi etc) or generally as abstractions of various actions. Service operations are sometimes implemented as software based functions or actions over hardware equipment (e.g. UPnP players). However, a single service satisfies an atomic only user need, so services need to be composed (i.e. combined), in order to provide the usually requested complex tasks. Since manual service composition is obviously a hassle for the user, ambient systems struggle to automate this process by applying various methods. The approaches that have been adopted during the last years vary widely in many aspects, like domain of application, modeling of services, composition method, knowledge representation and interfaces. This work presents a comparative view of these approaches revealing similarities and differences, while providing additional information.",

abstract="The primary challenges in outlining and arranging the operations of wireless sensor networks are to enhance energy utilization and the system lifetime. Clustering is a powerful approach to arranging a system into an associated order, load adjusting and enhancing the system lifetime. In a cluster based network, cluster head closer to the sink depletes its energy quickly resulting in hot spot problems. To conquer this issue, numerous algorithms on unequal clustering are contemplated. The drawback in these algorithms is that the nodes which join with the specific cluster head bring overburden for the cluster head. So, we propose an algorithm called fuzzy based unequal clustering in this paper to enhance the execution of the current algorithms. The proposed work is assessed by utilizing simulation. The proposed algorithm is compared with two algorithms, one with an equivalent clustering algorithm called LEACH and another with an unequal clustering algorithm called EAUCF. The simulation results using MATLAB demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides better performance compared to the other two algorithms.",

It is furthermore shown both analytically and experimentally that Min-entropy is considered better than Shannon, R{\'e}nyi or Max entropy for identifying encrypted content for the composite metric. This is in particular useful for implementing privacy-enhanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), where sampled encrypted traffic can be considered to have low risk of revealing sensitive information. The combined metric can be used in a Policy Enforcement Point that acts as a proxy/anonymiser in order to to reduce the leakage of private or sensitive information from the IDS sensors to an outsourced Managed Security Service provider. Although the composite privacy indicator is IDS specific, the authorisation architecture is general, and may also be useful for anonymising or pseusonymising sensitive information from or to other types of sensors that need to be exposed to the Internet. The solution is based on the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language policy language extended with support for Subjective Logic, in order to provide a method for expressing fine-grained access control policies that are based on uncertain evidences.",

abstract="Humanfall detection has attracted broad attentions as sensors and mobile devices are increasingly adopted in real-life scenarios such as smart homes. The complexity of activities in home environments pose severe challenges to the fall detection research with respect to the detection accuracy. We propose a collaborative detection platform that combines two subsystems: a threshold-based fall detection subsystem using mobile phones and a support vector machine (SVM)-based fall detection subsystem using Kinects. Both subsystems have their respective confidence models and the platform detects falls by fusing the data of both subsystems using two methods: the logical rules-based and D-S evidence fusion theory-based methods. We have validated the two confidence models based on mobile phone and Kinect, which achieve the accuracy of 84.17{\%} and 97.08{\%}, respectively. Our collaborative fall detection approach achieves the best accuracy of 100{\%}.",

We introduce a synergy of a traditional technology identification process, namely keyword extraction and verification by an expert community, with a machine learning algorithm. The result is a novel possibility to allocate patents which (1) reduces expert bias regarding vested interests on lexical query methods, (2) avoids problems with citation approaches, and (3) facilitates evolutionary changes. Based upon a small core set of worldwide service robotics patent applications, we derive apt n-gram frequency vectors and train a support vector machine, relying only on titles, abstracts, and IPC categorization of each document.

Therefore, researching on anti-collision algorithms to reduce the collisions and increasing the system efficiency becomes a hotspot. In this paper, we focus on the passive RFID tags and first propose a dynamical frame slotted ALOHA-based estimation method to predict the unknown population of tags. Based on this, an adjustment strategy is proposed to dynamically modify the frame size as the population of tags changes. In this adjustment strategy, a segment fashion is proposed to instead the slot-by-slot fashion; the former one could efficiently increase the reading speed and ensure the system throughput. As a result, the proposed algorithm could reach to the throughput of 35{\%} in average with a stable estimation accuracy of 80{\%}. The simulation shows that our algorithm also outperforms the other algorithms in the identification speed (tags/s).",

This situation leads to increased waiting time for the outpatients; in particular, the normal operation of a hospital will be congested at rush hour. The existence of this problem in outpatient departments causes a reduction in doctors' diagnostic time, and a high working strength is required to address this issue. In this paper, a simultaneous model based on machine learning is proposed for aiding outpatient doctors in performing diagnoses.

abstract="A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of many sensors that communicate wirelessly to monitor a physical region. Location information is critical essential and indispensable for many applications of WSNs. A promising solution for localizing statically deployed sensors is to benefit from mobile location-aware nodes called beacons. However, the essential problem is to find the optimum path that the mobile beacon should travel in order to improve localization accuracy, time and success as well as energy efficiency. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of five mobile beacon trajectories; Random Way Point, Scan, Hilbert, Circles and Localization algorithm with a Mobile Anchor node based on Trilateration (LMAT) based on three different localization techniques such as Weighted Centroid Localization and trilateration with time priority and accuracy priority. This evaluation aims to find effective and essential properties that the trajectory should have. Our simulations show that a random movement cannot guarantee the performance of localization. The results also show the efficiency of LMAT regarding accuracy, success and collinearity while the Hilbert space filling curve has lower energy consumption. Circles path planning can help to localize unknown sensors faster than others at the expense of lower localization precision.",

abstract="Acquiring real time sensory data using remote swarms of tiny sensors depends on efficient wireless networking. Often, battery longevity of the sensors is a critical design requirement, which makes long-range RF transmission inadequate for this task. A common solution is to use short-range and energy-efficient RF protocols within the swarm, then communicate with the outside world via a capable agent or a networking gateway. In this paper we suggest an alternative networking model, which enables the swarm to operate independently, without the assistance of an intermediate proxy. Specifically, we present a networking model in which the sensors in the swarm transmit data using energy-efficient free space optical links (FSO). We discuss the details of aiming optical transmission interfaces in the directions of distant sinks, such as antenna towers, drones and even LEO-satellites. This FSO-based network architecture poses various data collection problems, which are related to the directional nature of optical transmitters and receivers. Using simulations we address several such problems, and demonstrate the viability of the model for sensory data collection.",

abstract="This paper proposes a soft computing technology based on belief rule base (BRB) system for the tipping paper permeability measurement in tobacco factory. In current studies about BRB, both the referential values of the antecedent attributes and the utilities of the consequents are given in advance and are not trained by using the dedicated optimal algorithms. The limitations of expert knowledge may lead to error of BRB because both the referential values and the utilities make a real difference on the structure of BRB, and the appropriate structure is helpful for tuning parameters more accurately. Therefore, this paper focuses on the structure and parameters optimization of BRB (SPO-BRB) by taking the referential values of the antecedent attributes and the utilities of the consequents into account to improve the input--output modeling ability of BRB. However, SPO-BRB is a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem (NNOP). To deal with the NNOP of SPO-BRB, a particle swarm optimization algorithm with improved velocity update way and repair methods (PSO{\_}VR) is proposed. A case study based on the data collected from a tobacco factory of china is carried out. The test results demonstrate the functionality of SPO-BRB and the effectiveness of PSO{\_}VR.",

journal="Wireless Networks",
year="2016",
month="Dec",
day="28",
abstract="Single-path routing is widely used in wireless networks due to low resource consumption. However, it is vulnerable to link failure because such a failure may adversely affect an entire path. To overcome this, multipath routing has been proposed providing fault-tolerance. In this paper, we propose a novel multipath routing protocol called traffic-aware stateless multipath routing (TSMR) based on an overlaid tree topology comprising two topologies, namely, bounded degree tree (BDT) and root-oriented directional tree (RODT). BDT is strong on reducing routing overhead, and RODT is resilient against lossy links. By synergistically overlaying them, TSMR dynamically selects the local optimal path according to the given traffic flow and the failure on the primary path. In particular, TSMR enables stateless and low overhead routing despite multipath routing by keeping only one-hop neighbors to maintain multiple paths. To evaluate TSMR, we conducted simulations with a shadowing model reflecting lossy links, and compared with single and multipath routing protocols, such as ZTR, STR, AODV, and RPL. The simulation results show that the overall performance of TSMR surpasses that of others for packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, control overhead, memory consumption, and power consumption regardless of network size, number of sessions, and traffic flow.",

Applications based on such data, to improve existing products and processes as well as to create completely new ones, are regarded as a major driver of economic growth. At the same time consumers' concerns about the proper use of their data by organizations are growing. We conducted a conjoint study, comprising more than 3000 participants, to investigate consumers' data sharing sensitivities along six dimensions of context and across ten private and public sectors covering the whole economy. We find that nearly all consumers (99.9 {\%} of our sample) want to share personal data with organizations if the benefits and terms suffice their needs. Second, we show that consumers clearly discriminate between organizations from various industry sectors when it comes to their willingness to share their data. Third, we find that context of sharing personal data is more important in the consumers' decision making than the actual data itself. Further, we provide evidence that the right to be forgotten can significantly increase consumers' willingness to share their data.",

journal="Telecommunication Systems",
year="2017",
month="Sep",
day="12",
abstract="In a cognitive radio system, the goal is to make better use of the radio electric spectrum, allowing non-licensed users access to those currently unused electromagnetic bands assigned to licensed users (LUs). This can be achieved using OFDM, where the non-licensed users must select the temporarily available subcarriers and turn off those subcarriers used by LUs in order to avoid interference. Hence, only a subset of the subcarriers can be used for data or pilot tone transmission. To this end, some pilot allocation algorithms have been proposed for this dynamic scenario, but they are designed in such away that an equispaced pilot placement is respected (as much as possible) while minimizing the mean squared error of the channel estimate. Nevertheless, this equispaced placement can lead to the use of an increased number of pilots in order to achieve a good channel estimation. In this work, a new pilot allocation algorithm based on wavelet transform is presented. The proposed algorithm uses the discrete wavelet transform to analyze the previous channel state information, taking the knowledge of the available subcarriers into account to provide a suboptimal solution for the pilot positions. This solution leads to a non-equispaced pilot placement, which improves the channel estimation and consequently, the system performance. Likewise, the introduced algorithm allows a reduction of the number of necessary pilots, which aids in increasing the data rate. Finally, simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the algorithm in dynamic channel scenarios.",

abstract="In sensor-based systems, spatio-temporal data streams are often related in non-trivial ways. For example in avionics, while the airspeed that an aircraft attains in cruise phase depends on the weight it carries, it also depends on many other factors such as engine inputs, angle of attack, and air density. It is therefore a challenge to develop failure models that can help recognize errors in the data, such as an incorrect fuel quantity or an incorrect airspeed. In this paper, we present a highly-declarative programming framework that facilitates the development of self-healing avionics applications, which can detect and recover from data errors. Our programming framework enables specifying expert-created failure models using error signatures, as well as learning failure models from data. To account for unanticipated failure modes, we propose a new dynamic Bayes classifier, that detects outliers and upgrades them to new modes when statistically significant. We evaluate error signatures and our dynamic Bayes classifier for accuracy, response time, and adaptability of error detection. While error signatures can be more accurate and responsive than dynamic Bayesian learning, the latter method adapts better due to its data-driven nature.",

In this paper we focus on the problem of UWB-based wireless indoor localization of machines and humans by means of IEEE 802.15.4-2015 high rate pulse repetition UWB technology and specifically the accuracy of such localization. Namely, we report the results of an extensive experimental study revealing the effect of various communication settings on the accuracy of indoor localization for the proposed earlier asymmetric localization protocol. The conducted experiments lasted over 200 hours almost nonstop and involved transmission of more than 30 million ranging packets. In the experiments we have tested over 200 different modes and explored the effect of seven different parameters on the UWB ranging performance. The presented results reveal that the communication settings need to be accounted for when determining the time of flight using UWB. Also we show that the accuracy of ranging is strongly affected by the used channel, data rate and pulse repetition frequency. Finally, we note that the increase of the UWB transceiver's temperature due to self-heating has a strong effect on the results of the localization.",

However, the SDN technology is applied partially in the cloud computing until now because it is corresponded well with the cloud computing concepts and applications. Although these are very natural and common instances so far, the problem is very narrow the applying scope of SDN. Due to the fact that cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) has many variable features, it is very suitable for applying SDN technique. So, we propose the new information exchange architecture, which is based on the SDN technology, for C-ITS. The proposed architecture has improved the throughput than the legacy systems and can be adjusted the traffic flow based on the necessity. The proposed information exchange architecture can be transmitted data, which can be handled various information like as the road traffic flows, tracking the car, based on the interworking data forwarding scheme. Based on these schemes, the proposed architecture outperforms than the legacy systems in several aspects, and we have verified these results through the computer simulations using the OPNet.",

abstract="With continued advancements of mobile computing and communications, emerging novel multimedia services and applications have attracted lots of attention and been developed for mobile users, such as mobile social network, mobile cloud medical treatment, mobile cloud game. However, because of limited resources on mobile terminals, it is of great challenge to improve the energy efficiency of multimedia services. In this paper, we propose a cloud-assisted green multimedia processing architecture (CGMP) based on mobile cloud computing. Specifically, the tasks of multimedia processing with energy-extensive consumption can be offloaded to the cloud, and the face recognition algorithm with improved principal component analysis and nearest neighbor classifier is realized on CGMP based cloud platform. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively save the energy consumption of the equipment.",

In the current healthcare system, critical gaps exist in the collection of vital information from patients and transferring that information to healthcare providers. The information collection problems are particularly challenged in patients lacking verbal communication or under other serious conditions. Information handover among medical staff can also introduce human errors which may place a patient's health and life at risk. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a kind of electronic identification technology that is becoming widely deployed. RFID technology allows crucial personal information to be saved in a low-cost chip attached to the patient.

abstract="Recently sparse representations over learned dictionaries have been proven to be a very successful representation method for many image processing applications. In the medical image processing community, image super-resolution has been playing a vital role to make the computer based diagnosis more efficient and accurate. Resolution enhancement through conventional interpolation methods strongly affects the precision of consequent processing steps such as segmentation and registration. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized K-SVD dictionary learning based medical image super-resolution algorithm. First, the dictionary is trained using the modified version of the K-SVD dictionary learning procedure. The sparse coding phase of the K-SVD dictionary learning scheme is then enhanced incorporating a simple and an efficient regularized version of orthogonal matching pursuit. In addition, the dictionary update stage allows for an arbitrary number of atoms at the same time and sparse coefficient vector. In the SR reconstruction procedure, ROMP is adopted to find out for the vector of sparse representation coefficients for the underlying patch. In the final part, mathematical optimization finalizes the SR work effectively. The numerical analysis and experimental simulation prove the feasibility and robustness of our proposed methodology compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

These systems require the communication protocols to be both reliable and real-time in data transmissions. IEEE 802.15.4 can be regarded as the canonical protocols in this area owing to its low-power and low-cost features. However, it falls short of reliability and timeliness guarantees. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive MAC protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4, namely Ada-MAC. The proposed protocol combines schedule-based on time-triggered protocol and contention-based CSMA/CA mechanism. It can not only enable dynamic Guaranteed Time Slots allocation but also provide differentiated services for different nodes according to their data types. The proposed protocol is implemented on the OMNeT++ platform. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of Ada-MAC in comparison with the traditional IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. The results show the superiority of the proposed protocol in terms of reliability and timeliness.",

The spatial multi-criteria decision analysis approach combines the multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic information system (GIS) to model the spatially explicit and implicit information and to make a practical decision under different scenarios and different environment. Malaria is one of the emerging diseases worldwide; the cause of malaria is weather {\&} climate condition of the study area.

There is need to develop an integrated approach that consists of spatially implicit and explicit information.

abstract="Nowadays, big media healthcare data processing in cloud has become an effective solution for satisfying QoS demands of medical users. It can support various healthcare services such as pre-processing, storing, sharing, and analysis of monitored data as well as acquiring context-awareness. However, to support energy and cost savings, the union of cloud data centers termed as cloud confederation can be an promising approach, which helps a cloud provider to overcome the limitation of physical resources. However, the key challenge in it is to achieve multiple contradictory objectives, e.g., meeting the required level of services defined in service level agreement, maintaining medial users'application QoS, etc. while maximizing profit of a cloud provider. In this paper, for executing heterogeneous big healthcare data processing requests from users, we develop a local and global cloud confederation model, namely FnF, that makes an optimal selection decision for target cloud data center(s) by exploiting Fuzzy logic. The FnF trades off in between profit of cloud provider and user application QoS in selecting federated data center(s). In addition, FnF enhances its decision accuracy by precisely estimating the resource requirements for the big data processing tasks using multiple linear regression. The proposed FnF model is validated through numerical as well as experimental evaluations. Simulation results depict the effectiveness and efficiency of the FnF model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

abstract="Wireless body area network (WBAN) has witnessed significant attentions in the healthcare domain using biomedical sensor-based monitoring of heterogeneous nature of vital signs of a patient's body. The design of frequency band, MAC superframe structure, and slots allocation to the heterogeneous nature of the patient's packets have become the challenging problems in WBAN due to the diverse QoS requirements. In this context, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Traffic Prioritization for Medium Access Control (EETP-MAC) protocol, which provides sufficient slots with higher bandwidth and guard bands to avoid channels interference causing longer delay. Specifically, the design of EETP-MAC is broadly divided in to four folds. Firstly, patient data traffic prioritization is presented with broad categorization including Non-Constrained Data (NCD), Delay-Constrained Data (DCD), Reliability-Constrained Data (RCD) and Critical Data (CD). Secondly, a modified superframe structure design is proposed for effectively handling the traffic prioritization. Thirdly, threshold based slot allocation technique is developed to reduce contention by effectively quantifying criticality on patient data. Forth, an energy efficient frame design is presented focusing on beacon interval, superframe duration, and packet size and inactive period. Simulations are performed to comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed EETP-MAC with the state-of-the-art MAC protocols. The comparative evaluation attests the benefit of EETP-MAC in terms of efficient slot allocation resulting in lower delay and energy consumption.",

abstract="This paper presents a digital image encryption algorithm based on bit-planes and an improved logistic map. First, a chaotic sequence, which is generated by the improved logistic map, scrambles the pixels of the original image. Second, the scrambled image is split into a high 4-bit matrix and a low 4-bit matrix. The low 4-bit matrix is then introduced into the improved logistic model to generate a chaotic sequence that is highly correlated with the image as the key, and the key is used for position scrambling and the XOR operation of the high 4-bit matrix. Finally, the two matrices are combined into an 8-bit image matrix to obtain the ciphertext image. The algorithm has a significant one-time pad characteristic. MATLAB simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the security of image encryption in terms of the histogram, plaintext sensitivity, information entropy, and adjacent pixels correlation index. Experimental results show that the number of pixel changes ratio (NPCR) is greater than 90{\%} and the information entropy of the ciphertext image reaches 7.99, demonstrating that the algorithm offers good encryption.",

abstract="The intelligent bed, a mechanical hospital bed equipped with several electronic sensor functions, is an assistive healthcare solution intended to reduce the manual workload of health professionals by providing valuable real-time and non-vital information about patients. Implementation of the intelligent bed in the Chinese health care context has not been fully studied. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of Chinese health professionals during a 12-month implementation period of the intelligent bed in a rehabilitation department at a large tertiary hospital in Guangzhou. A documentary study was carried out 3 months prior to implementation. Participant observation totalling 35 h and qualitative semi-structured interviews with 9 h and 50 min were conducted over a 12-month testing period. Findings in this study highlighted the improved working ergonomics of the intelligent bed in comparison with regular hospital mechanical beds. The bed's other advanced functions, however, were either not used by the staff, quickly abandoned after a month, or never fully implemented. Barriers to full implementation of the bed's functions were the Chinese hierarchical organizational culture, inadequate training of the health professionals on the implementation of the intelligent bed, lack of user-friendliness, and insufficient technical support.",

abstract="Video frame manipulation has become commonplace with the growing easy access to powerful computing abilities. One of the most common types of video frame tampers is the copy-paste tamper, wherein a region from a video frame is replaced with another region from the same frame. In order to improve the robustness of passive video tampering detection, we propose a content-based video similarity tamper passive blind detection algorithm based on multi-scale normalized mutual information which can implement video frame copy, frame insertion and frame deletion tamper detection. The detail implementation of the proposed algorithm consists of multi-scale content analysis, single-scale content similarity measure, multi-scale content similarity measure, and tampering positioning. Firstly, we get the scales of the visual content of the video frame using Gaussian pyramid transform; Secondly, to measure the similarity of single-scale visual content, we define adjacent normalized mutual information of two frames according to information theory; Thirdly, we construct the multi-scale normalized mutual information descriptors to achieve the multi-scale visual content similarity measure of adjacent two frames using a linear combination. Finally, we use the local outlier isolated factor detection algorithm to detect the position of the video tampering. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only detect the video frame tampering position of delete, copy, and insert effectively, but also can detect the tampering of different and homology video encoding formats. We obtain a feature detecting accuracy in excess of 93{\%} and detection rate of 96{\%} across post processing operations, and are able to detect the delete, copy, and insert regions with a high true positive rate and lower false positive rate than the existing time field tamper detection methods.",

abstract="This paper presents an innovative technique to find out the most influential challenge faced by big data. Presently, the key challenges faced by big data are security, privacy, and accuracy. To prioritize the most influential factor among the three, we need to select the suitable factor that accomplishes our objectives within the available resources. In this study, we propose the Analytic Network Process (ANP) technique for evaluating these challenges. The study also appraises the ANP model in comparison with the priorities of all competing challenges inside the big data. The secondary data has been taken for the ANP analysis from numerous scholarly articles focusing on big data. In our analysis, we have proposed a policy assessment of the relation between big data characteristics and the challenges; it further prioritizes the consequent results for the most influential challenge by using ANP model. The empirical results conclude that the security has the highest influence value i.e. 54{\%} of the total measurement, while privacy and accuracy stand second and third among the most influential factors with 36{\%} and 8{\%} values respectively. Finally, the study provides important clues in the decision-making process in finding the solutions to such challenges faced by big data.",

The security of the transmission messages is of utmost importance, and to protect the transmission messages we propose a secure ambulance communication protocol for VANET to ensure that messages will not be revealed or stolen. The proposed scheme combines symmetric encryption, message authentication codes and digital signature mechanisms, and thereby achieves non-repudiation, availability, integrity, confidentiality, mutual authentication, session key security, known-key security and the ability to prevent known attacks. Finally, with NS2 simulation results that are based on realistic vehicle density statistics and the Taipei city road map, we argue that our secure ambulance communication protocol is effective in real VANET scenarios.",

With respect to communications, wireless body area networks (WBANs) are highly suitable communication technologies for wearable M2M. Most existing research for WBANs have mainly focused on a one-hop star network configuration due to their ease of implementation. However, in an environment with a real wearable M2M system, a multi-hop network can be a more suitable solution for communication due to its various advantages, including a low heat generation, low path loss, low inter-network interference, etc., despite the high difficulty in management. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN configuration approach (MWCA) for wearable M2M systems. MWCA improves network throughput by exploiting multi-channel communications, and it achieves high energy efficiency by reducing the transmission power of each M2M device. We also investigate the performance of MWCA by using an analytical model, which is validated through the use of experimental simulations.",

However, previous motion detection algorithms fail to achieve the flexibility and accuracy simultaneously for good detection results. In the present work, a scene-adaptive motion detection model based on machine learning and clustering technology is proposed. This model begins with training to the system by a group of testing images, in terms of various accurate parameters of one certain scene. Significant modifications have been reserved in the same area during motion detection, which are considered as a change clustering. Then, the model takes advantage of clustering technology to generate a minimum spanning tree (MST), which is one kind of average linkage clustering. The average shortest distance of the minimum spanning tree serves as a benchmark to identify the change in images. Finally the training parameters and detection algorithm are combined to monitor the scene. The clustering is introduced to this model during sample training, in order to obtain factors of higher quality followed by more accurate detection results. Finally, the experiment confirms the excellent adaptability and precision of the proposed motion detection model.",

pages="2683--2711",
abstract="Congestion in Wireless Sensor Networks is one of the primary causes of performance degradation due to severe packet loss leading to excessive energy consumption. Normally, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network gets fragmented. To mitigate this issue, we propose a three phase energy balanced zone based routing protocol. Specifically, in the first phase the region is physically divided into equi-sized zones. In the second phase, a node with minimum traffic and minimum distance from other nodes inside each zone is selected as the zone leader. This leader is responsible for delivering data generated by any node in that zone and for routing and forwarding the data received from other zone leaders of the neighbor zones. In the third phase, zones are categorized as non-congested, medium-congested and congested zones and route path is established in inter and intra zones. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the zone congestion levels along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed both at inter and intra zone levels in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 10.5{\%} enhancement in the network throughput, 19.5{\%} energy saving when compared with grid-based multi-path GMCAR with congestion avoidance and 23.03{\%} energy saving when compared with priority-based application-specific congestion control clustering protocol PASCC.",

abstract="Accurate categorization of cirrhosis liver image in ultrasound modality is of great importance in medical diagnosis and treatment. Health informatics is important as it provides quick predictions on diseases based on nearness of symptoms. Modelling solutions for the same on cloud using deep learning is the motivation of this paper. Here, we propose a deep learning model associated with correlation based feature selection method for cirrhosis image classification. We compare the results with three other conventional classifiers algorithms to improve the better classification accuracy. First in pre-processing stage, noises are eliminated from pathological scan images by using modified laplacian pyramid non-linear diffusion filter. From the pre-processed scan images, each cirrhosis region is obtained under the guidance of radiology or physicians. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch by gray level, local binary pattern and scale invariant feature, a feature selection technique is applied to choice the predominant texture features for each classifier. Finally a convolution neural network is implemented to improve the performance of classifiers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Convolution neural network algorithm with two hidden layers gives more accuracy in classifying cirrhosis image with 98{\%} sensitivity. Experiments are carried out with 990 cirrhosis image patches which demonstrates that our proposed deep learning classifier perform 100{\%} well than original classifiers in terms of accuracy.",

In the new protocol, firstly, two new fitness functions with energy awareness for clustering and routing are formulated respectively. Secondly, a novel greedy discrete PSO with memory (GMDPSO) is put forward to build optimal routing tree. In GMDPSO, particle's position and velocity are redefined under a discrete scenario; particle update rules are reconsidered based on the network topology; a greedy search strategy is designed to drive particles to find better positon quickly. Besides, searching histories are memorized to accelerate convergence. Simulations results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the new protocol.",

Initially, the marks of the students from semester 1 to semester 7 are collected from different colleges. In the training phase, the features are selected from the student's information and the intermediate data is generated by the mapper. Then, the intermediate data is provided to the reducer function which is built with the CDF-NN to provide the estimated marks of the students in a forthcoming semester.

However, virtualization also introduces many challenges to the multicore timing analysis; for instance, the overhead due to cache misses becomes harder to predict, since it depends not only on the direct interference between tasks but also on the indirect interference between virtual processors and the tasks executing on them. In this paper, we present a cache-aware compositional analysis technique that can be used to ensure timing guarantees of components scheduled on a multicore virtualization platform. Our technique improves on previous multicore compositional analyses by accounting for the cache-related overhead in the components' interfaces, and it addresses the new virtualization-specific challenges in the overhead analysis. To demonstrate the utility of our technique, we report results from an extensive evaluation based on randomly generated workloads.",

abstract="ZigBee is one of the key standards that enable low-cost and low-power wireless mesh networks. Working on top of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY standard, ZigBee defines higher layers that support reliable multi-hop wireless communications. In particular, ZigBee provides multiple routing protocols to support diverse application traffic types such as multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point. However, there are no studies that thoroughly incorporate multiple ZigBee routing protocols. In this paper, we explore multiple unicast routing and many-to-one protocols incorporated into the ZigBee standard and compare them through extensive simulations using NS2. We discuss real-world implementation issues and introduce our implementation decisions. We also examine their suitability for different scenarios and discuss some of the improvements that can be made to the ZigBee standard routing protocols.",

abstract="Recently, multimedia cloud is being considered as a new effective serving mode in e-Health area that meets the requirement of scalable and economic multimedia service for e-health. It can provide a flexible stack of powerful Virtual Machine (VM) resources of cloud like CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth etc. on demand to manage e-health media services and applications (e.g. medical image/video retrieval, health video transcoding, streaming, video rendering, sharing and delivery) at lower cost. However, one major issue here is how to efficiently allocate VM resources dynamically based on e-health applications' QoS demands and support energy and cost savings by optimizing the number of servers in use. In order to solve this problem, we propose a cost effective and dynamic VM allocation model based on Nash bargaining solution. With extensive simulations it is shown that the proposed mechanism can reduce the overall cost of running servers while at the same time guarantee QoS demand and maximize resource utilization in various dimensions of server resources.",

abstract="Independent living of senior citizens is one of the main challenges linked to the ageing population. Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including the decline in cardiopulmonary conditions, weaker muscle functions and a declined neuromuscular control of the movements, which result in a higher risk of fall and a higher vulnerability for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With respect to cognitive functions, senior citizens may suffer from a decline of memory function, less ability to orientate and a declined ability to cope with complex situations. This is by itself a big societal challenge with impact in multiple sectors. In this paper we present an innovative ICT solution, named eWALL, that aims to address these challenges by means of an advanced ICT infrastructure and home sensing environment; thus differentiating from existing eHealth and eCare solutions. The system of eWALL will extend the state-of-the-art of Assistive Platforms and will significantly increase the independent living of seniors.",

abstract="Outlier detection is critical for many applications such as healthcare, health insurance, medical diagnosis, predictive analytics, pattern recognition, intrusion detection, anomaly or defect detection, video surveillance, credit card fraud detection and text mining. Outlier detection techniques could be statistics, distance- or model based. Techniques, which are based on a single method for outlier detection usually have weaknesses and strengths and are mostly unstable. Outlier detection ensembles harness the strengths of individual detectors and result in stable performance. This paper presents a new parameter based growing self-organizing maps ensemble (GSOME) for outlier detection in multivariate patterns. For outlier detection, the proposed GSOME transforms non-linear relationships between high dimensional patterns into a simple 1D geometric relationship. Whatever the pattern dimensionality is, it is mapped to a single point of a line. The dispersion of mapped points will be used to locate the outliers and measure the degree of outlyingness. Several experiments on both real and synthetic data sets show the promising performance of the proposed GSOME.",

In this paper, we propose an IP-based mobility management protocol named Fast handover Proxy Mobile IPv6 for Sensor networks (FPMIPv6-S). FPMIPv6-S provides network-based mobility support for 6LoWPAN WSN when a sensor node moves between two Personal Area Networks. It is an improved version of the PMIPv6 protocol proposed for mobility management in IPv6 networks. FPMIPv6-S messages are carried by RPL protocol. Analytical evaluation of the proposed protocol shows significantly improved performance with respect to network mobility cost (signalling traffic) when compared to PMIPv6 and RPL alone. We also integrated the FPMIPv6-S protocol in the NS-3 simulator and performed a thorough performance comparison of FPMIPv6-S and RPL.",

abstract="As an important part of traditional medicine, TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) has unique and distinct clinical effects in the aspect of disease diagnosis and treatment. Thousands of years of TCM treatment has accumulated abundant clinical data and medical literatures, including valued TCM theories and clinical practice rules. Researchers have conducted various methods such as clustering analysis, association rules and regression analysis to study TCM theory. However, none of them could reflect well the semantic complexity of TCM and systemic characteristics of TCM treatment. This paper conducted a research on the inherent rules of TCM clinic records with a topic model. On the basis of LDA model, weighted mechanism was adopted for each feature word to improve the distinguishing ability and interpretability between the topics. Meanwhile, the modeled topic is taken as the feature for the classification of SVM (Support Vector Machine) to improve the classification accuracy. The topic number of LDA topic model is confirmed by the KL distance and similarity between the topics. After analyzing the relationship between topic model and TCM differentiation and treatment, MULTI-RELATIONSHIP Topics LDA MODEL was proposed on the basis of LDA model and Author-topic model to automatically extract the topic structures between the four parties and explore the relationship of the multiple parties with clinical significance. In the meantime, relevancy between the parties and the feature word weighted mechanism are used to improve the MULTI-RELATIONSHIP Topics LDA MODEL and the classification accuracy of the topics. The experiments showed that analysis of clinical data with topic model can extract TCM treatment rules and provide a novel theoretical method for TCM clinical research.",

Recently, many research projects have employed wearable devices to detect and analyze ADLs. However, most wearable devices obstruct natural movement of the body, and the analysis of activities lacks adequate consideration of various real attributes. To tackle these issues, we proposed a two-fold solution. First, regarding unobtrusive detection of ADLs, only one small device is worn on a finger to sense and collect activity information, and identifiable features are extracted from the finger-related signals to identify various activities. Second, to reflect realistic life situations, a weighted sequence alignment approach is proposed to analyze an activity sequence detected by the device, as well as attributes of each activity in the sequence. The system is validated using 10 daily activities and 3 activity sequences. Results show 96.8 {\%} accuracy in recognizing activities and the effectiveness of sequence analysis.",

Mobile crowd management is yet an emerging new exploration for search and rescue (SAR) operations. The phase of catastrophic management has communication to play a vital role. In MANETs, the end nodes communicate through the TCP/IP protocol. The layers of TCP/IP model change frequently due to mobility and resource overhead. This makes routing in MANETs one of the challenging research area. This review provides an overview of MANET based routing protocols employed for communication during SAR operations. The main purpose of this survey is to provide taxonomy on communication strategies of MANETs during disaster and emergency situation.

In this paper, several solutions are presented that enable deployment of these applications on standard web browsers, even those from the pre-HTML5 era. The focus in this paper is on two specific use case scenarios, taking into account that the proposed solutions are generic enough to be applied to a range of similar applications. The technologies presented cover the entire range of sub-processes contained in a complete remote rendering solution, such as the establishment of interaction feedback channels and delivery of images as part of the rendering pipeline. Depending on factors such as application requirements, developer preferences, feature availability in the web browser or raw performance figures, a custom solution can be composed from the options discussed in this paper. This is illustrated by applying them to the two aforementioned use cases, each with specific requirements and challenges, and benchmarking these example setups in terms of performance. A comparison of advantages and disadvantages is presented to guide developers in applying the technologies under real-life conditions.",

abstract="Centerline is generally used to measure topological and morphological parameters of blood vessels, which is pivotal for the quantitative analysis of vascular diseases. However, previous centerline extraction methods have two drawbacks on complex blood vessels, represented as the failure on ring-like structures and the existing of multi-voxel width. In this paper, we propose a monocentric centerline extraction method for ring-like blood vessels, which consists of three components. First, multiple centerlines are generated from the seed points that are chosen by randomly sprinkling points on blood vessel data. Second, multi-centerline fusion is used to repair the notches of centerlines on ring-like vessels, and the local maximum of distance from oundary is employed to remedy the missing centerline points. Finally, monocentric processing is devised to keep the vascular centerline with single voxel width. We compared the proposed method with Wan et al.'s method and topological thinning on five groups of data including synthesized vascular datasets and MR brain images. The result showed the proposed method performed better than the two contrast methods both by visual inspection and by quantitative assessment, which demonstrated the performance of the proposed method on ring-like blood vessels as well as the elimination of multi-voxel width points.",

Firstly, we discuss two types of chief collisions at a micro level (i.e., staggered collisions and direct collisions) in the presence of hidden and exposed terminals, respectively. Then we discuss various direct collisions between RTS/CTS frames in slotted CSMA/CA. Furthermore, we highlight a special type of direct collisions which can neither be detected by interfering nodes nor discovered before the collisions of DATAs (i.e., indiscoverable collisions). A hypothesis, several propositions and conclusions are presented to explain which is the domination of the collisions and how the direct collisions are released. Numerical results verify our conclusions and confirm that the indiscoverable collisions turn out to be another key issue in coexisting WBANs. The simulation in mobile environment with time-varying traffic is carried out to show the impact of collisions on network performance. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive collision analysis at the micro level for the evolution of CSMA/CA based MAC protocol and the first estimation of indiscoverable collisions in duty cycled WBANs.",

abstract="Face recognition, expression identification, age determination, racial binding and gender classification are common examples of image processing computerization. Gender classification is very straightforward for us like we can tell by the person's hair, nose, eyes, mouth and skin whether that person is a male or female with a relatively high degree of confidence and accuracy; however, can we program a computer to perform just as well at gender classification? The very problem is the main focus of this research. The conventional sequence for recent real-time facial image processing consists of five steps: face detection, noise removal, face alignment, feature representation and classification. With the aim of human gender classification, face alignment and feature vector extraction stages have been re-examined keeping in view the application of the system on smartphones. Face alignment has been made by spotting out 83 facial landmarks and 3-D facial model with the purpose of applying affine transformation. Furthermore, `feature representation' is prepared through proposed modification in multilayer deep neural network, and hence we name it Deepgender. This convolutional deep neural network consists of some locally connected hidden layers without common weights of kernels as previously followed in legacy layered architecture. This specific case study involves deep learning as four convolutional layers, three max-pool layers (for downsizing of unrelated data), two fully connected layers (connection of outcome to all inputs) and a single layer of `multinomial logistic regression.' Training has been made using CAS-PEAL and FEI which contain 99,594 face images of 1040 people and 2800 face images of 200 individuals, respectively. These images are either in different poses or taken under uncontrolled conditions which are close to real-time input facial image for gender classification application. The proposed system `Deepgender' has registered 98{\%} accuracy by combined use of both databases with the specific preprocess procedure, i.e., exhibiting alignment before resizing. Experiments suggest that accuracy is nearly 100{\%} with frontal and nonblurred facial images. State-of-the-art steps have been taken to overcome memory and battery constraints in mobiles.",

abstract="Prevalent Wi-Fi networks have adopted various protections to prevent eavesdropping caused by the intrinsic shared nature of wireless medium. However, many of them are based on pre-shared secret incurring key management costs, and are still vulnerable from practical countermeasures. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using defensive jamming technique to protect enterprise Wi-Fi networks from potential eavesdroppers. This non-cryptographic approach requires neither any pre-shared key or high deployment costs. Defensive jammers geographically confine the wireless coverage of Wi-Fi access point, and thus block the message reception outside an arbitrary boundary at a physical layer. We provide a theoretical model fine tuning the jamming parameters for jammer placement. We then discuss practical considerations including optimized jammer arrangement algorithms, interference countermeasures to legitimate communications, and countermeasures against advanced attackers.",

abstract="Advancements in technology have transformed mobile devices from being mere communication widgets to versatile computing devices. Proliferation of these hand held devices has made them a common mean to access and process digital information. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can conveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, web-services (applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans) are not as commonly provided/consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating this and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has the potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the major challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service registry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile mobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for traditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided `solely' over mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end computing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in the form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility of our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the proposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the proposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) registry is also included. The evaluation of our framework has shown propitious results in terms of battery cost, scalability, hindrance with native applications.",

abstract="Facial expression recognition plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications of psychotherapy, security systems, marketing, commerce and much more. Detecting a macro-expression, which is a direct representation of an `emotion,' is a relatively straight-forward task. Playing a pivotal role as macro-expressions, micro-expressions are more accurate indicators of a train of thought or even subtle, passive or involuntary thoughts. Compared to macro-expressions, identifying micro-expressions is a much more challenging research question because their time spans are narrowed down to a fraction of a second, and can only be defined using a broader classification scale. This paper is an all-inclusive survey-cum-analysis of the various micro-expression recognition techniques. We analyze the general framework for micro-expression recognition system by decomposing the pipeline into fundamental components, namely face detecting, pre-processing, facial feature detection and extraction, datasets, and classification. We discuss the role of these elements and highlight the models and new trends that are followed in their design. Moreover, we provide an extensive analysis of micro-expression recognition systems by comparing their performance. We also discuss the new deep learning features that can, in the near future, replace the hand-crafted features for facial micro-expression recognition. This survey has been developed, focusing on the methodologies applied, databases used, performance regarding recognition accuracy and comparing these to distil the gaps in the efficiencies, future scope, and research potentials. Through this survey, we intend to look into this problem and develop a comprehensive and efficient recognition scheme. This study allows us to identify open issues and to determine future directions for designing real-world micro-expression recognition systems.",

abstract="As future Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications aim at supporting wireless networks with large coverage range and a huge number of devices without human intervention, energy-efficient protocol design for M2M communications networks becomes notably significant. The emerging energy harvesting technology, allowing devices to harvest energy from external sources automatically without human intervention, is promisingly applied to M2M communications networks, which can therefore operate permanently. However, currently available IEEE 802.11 protocols do not consider supporting energy-harvesting devices efficiently. Our research focuses effort in enhancing IEEE 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) with widely-deployed numerous devices powered by energy-harvesting modules so as to realize an energy-efficient M2M communications network. We propose DeepSleep with the aim of improving energy-efficiency and reducing the overall outage probability, application layer loss rate and collision probability. The effectiveness of DeepSleep is demonstrated by NS-2 platform. An analytical model is provided to select DeepSleep parameters. Applying DeepSleep, an energy-harvesting device can have less energy wastage on idle listening and overhearing, and have a higher channel access priority when waking up from a relatively longer period of sleeping. In addition, the channel access fairness is considered in DeepSleep design. In addition, all devices benefit when DeepSleep and 802.11 PSM co-exist in the network, which implies DeepSleep has potential to be deployed in existing WLANs.",

abstract="Delay jitter, which can affect the performance of controlled physical system and result in system instability, is an important issue for supporting instantaneity in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to guarantee continuous, real-time and dependable operation. Thus, it is significant to establish an algorithm to smoothing the delay jitter. In this paper, first, we compare several delay jitter smoothing algorithms, discuss their merits and demerits, and then propose one new algorithm over the existing algorithms, called derivative least square (DLS), which can eliminates the reverse way delay variation spikes. Second, we address the problem of most delay jitter smoothing schemes, namely they used uniformly distributed random numbers to simulate network delay data, which deviates from real network delay. To demonstrate the validity and reliability of DLS, except uniform distribution, Pareto distribution, of which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is more close to the CDF of real network delay, is applied to conduct the experiment. The experimental results show that compared with the other three existing algorithms, DLS can be more effective and reliable in predicting the play-back delay.",

In this work, we propose an energy efficient algorithm based on the sentinel scheme to reduce the sleeping node detection density by defining a new deep sleeping state for each sensor node. The average energy consumed by probing neighboring nodes is introduced as a factor to calculate the detection rate. In addition, after some theoretical analysis of the existence of coverage holes in WSN, a triangle coverage repair procedure is defined to repair coverage holes. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm obtained better performance in terms of the coverage quality and network life time compared with some existing algorithms in the literature.",

However, existing map searching services only support simple keywords based location search, which neglect users' complex search requirements, such as searching a hotel surrounded by station, shopping mall, cinema, etc. In this paper, we propose a map searching framework which maps users' complex search requirements into a graph pattern match problem. In this framework, the user's query requirements are mapped into a undirected graph, where the vertexes indicate the searched locations, and the edges represent the distance between connected locations. In this way, we propose a common pattern searching algorithm to give the top k matches groups and arrange them using a similarity. The similarity is defined by multi-model information, i.e., the graph structure, location categories, review stars, and review counts. Moreover, this method also allows user to input ambiguous and uncertain query condition with sketching query map. To adapt the method to large-scale data, we also filter the candidate groups by effective pruning methods. The evaluations on Yelp dataset demonstrate the proposed method is effective and flexibility in both certain and uncertain query graphs.",

Experimental results demonstrate that the approach can detect various types of falls efficiently (i.e., in real-time within a smart phone processor) and also correctly (95 {\%} and 93 {\%} true positives for falls ending with `lying' and `sit-tilted' respectively).

abstract="Understanding crowd behavior using automated video analytics is a relevant research problem in recent times due to complex challenges in monitoring large gatherings. From an automated video surveillance perspective, estimation of crowd density in particular regions of the video scene is an indispensable tool in understanding crowd behavior. Crowd density estimation provides the measure of number of people in a given region at a specified time. While most of the existing computer vision methods use supervised training to arrive at density estimates, we propose an approach to estimate crowd density using motion cues and hierarchical clustering. The proposed method incorporates optical flow for motion estimation, contour analysis for crowd silhouette detection, and clustering to derive the crowd density. The proposed approach has been tested on a dataset collected at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and two publicly available crowd datasets---Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance (PETS) 2009 and University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Pedestrian Traffic Database---with different crowd densities (medium- to high-density crowds) and in varied environmental conditions (in the presence of partial occlusions).

Some of these activities are known to have direct/indirect effect on the condition of their skin. Typical examples include lack of sleeping, excessive drinking, and persistent sunlight exposure. In this paper, we propose a scheme for evaluating the condition of a user's skin based on their everyday activities collected from their postings. For such an evaluation, users should regularly send microscopic images of their skin to a server using their smartphone. Meanwhile, the server collects the user postings from their SNS and analyzes them to identify activities that might have an influence on their skin. Finally, the server provides the user with a report containing a comparison of their past and current skin conditions, a statistical summary of their occasional events collected from their SNS, and a set of advices for improving their skin condition including skin care products. We built a prototype system and performed various experiments to show the effectiveness of our scheme. We report some of the results.",

Finally, we provide supporting numerical experiments on graphs and compare with other denoising methods. The results on some image denoising tasks indicate the effectiveness of our method.",

The cluster has a number of advantages which are not shared with conventional data-centre based cluster, including its low total power consumption, easy portability due to its small size and weight, affordability, and passive, ambient cooling. We propose that these attributes make Iridis-Pi ideally suited to educational applications, where it provides a low-cost starting point to inspire and enable students to understand and apply high-performance computing and data handling to tackle complex engineering and scientific challenges. We present the results of benchmarking both the computational power and network performance of the ``Iridis-Pi.'' We also argue that such systems should be considered in some additional specialist application areas where these unique attributes may prove advantageous. We believe that the choice of an ARM CPU foreshadows a trend towards the increasing adoption of low-power, non-PC-compatible architectures in high performance clusters.",

In iDV-Hop1 and iDV-Hop2, all steps of the original DV-Hop are kept, and several steps based on geometry improvements of the localization problem are added in order to obtain better localization accuracy. The third algorithm (Quad DV-Hop) formulated the localization problem as bounded least squares problem, to be solved by quadratic programming. Simulations are carried out on the four different types of network topology by varying nodes communication range, number of anchor nodes and number of nodes. Comparison of our algorithms with the original DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop algorithms are given. It is shown that iDV-Hop1 algorithm can significantly reduce the localization error (up to three times) in scenarios with irregular topologies compared to DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop. In scenarios with regular topologies, iDV-Hop2 and Quad DV-Hop showed better performance compared to DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop (up to 11 {\%} lower localization error).",

abstract="Magnetic induction applications mostly rely on resonance for inducing maximum magnetic fields to system loads and hence for each resonant frequency dedicated circuits are required. Unfortunately, the frequency responses of such inductive systems manifest several peaks (frequency splitting) when their coupling coefficients are equal to or larger than critical coupling. Such frequency responses with several peaks are detrimental when the objective is to transfer maximum energy. Frequency splitting between inductive coils have been seen to date as detrimental to wireless power transfer and inductive communication systems. In this paper it is demonstrated that frequency splitting is a welcome phenomenon with advantage in the design of inductive filter banks and multi-frequency inductive systems. The centre frequencies of the filter banks result from split bands of inductive systems. This phenomenon is applied in conjunction with an innovative recursive algorithm to design inductive filter banks. The filters straddle both sides of the resonant frequency position and can be resolved individually.",

abstract="MPEG-DASH standard has been proposed to standardize the proprietary solutions proposed to stream multi-qualities encoded video/audio over HTTP. Although MPEG-DASH relies on the client/server communication model, in this paper we show that it could be also used in a full P2P streaming system after making the necessary changes in the MPEG-DASH standard as well as in the main modules of the P2P streaming system. The main changes are made in the Media Presentation Description (MPD) file to support the P2P network bootstrapping mechanism (peers selection algorithm) as well as in the pieces selection algorithm to make the peer quality adaptation enabled as imposed by the MPEG-DASH. We choose the famous BitTorrent protocol as an example to implement the required changes. Extensive simulations have been conducted under the OMNeT + + simulator. The obtained results in terms of the average missed segments and the average waiting time on playback are reasonable with regards to 1) the BitTorrent known issue in the streaming context, to 2) the hard conditions we considered in our simulation set-up and 3) compared to some representative related works. This results show that MPEG-DASH could be easily supported by P2P streaming systems.",

This paper describes the challenges of providing a good network coverage, sufficient network lifetime, a physical design able to cope with the harsh environments met in deployments, and cost. How these challenges were approached in the development of a wireless sensor network based system that provides continuous, automatic, and up-to-date information on a crop storage, while presenting the data in an easily accessible manner, is also described. The design decisions, challenges, and practical experiences from real-world large scale deployment of the system are also discussed.

However, interference scenarios in D2D communications are usually more complicated than conventional wireless communications, e.g., spectrum reuse is commonly involved in D2D communications, especially when it works as an underlay. Therefore, how to coordinate the challenges of significant interference with the demand of higher data rates under the constraints of efficient energy consumption and spectrum utilization has become a haunting problem in our way to the ideal performance of wireless communications system. The solution resides in multiple resource allocation techniques in D2D communications as each of them attempts to solve or optimize one or several essential elements in the system. In this paper, a survey of resource allocation schemes in D2D communications is presented. We discuss the optimization classification including objectives, constraints, problem types and solutions.

Five different test study cases are presented, four in Slovenia and one in Austria, each with different specific target user groups and their own dynamics. According to the project disposition goals the focus was on the elderly. Methods, such as think-aloud protocol in combination with a guided interview and observation of verbal as well as of non-verbal responses, were used. To ensure the repeatability of tests and to help guide the process, a special questionnaire was developed. The research questions focused on: the navigation and interaction concept, the content, the readability, and the overall acceptance and the perception of value of the TV-WEB service. More than 74 users participated in the user experience studies, 27 of them 65 years old or older. The results indicate that the presented navigation and interaction concept is indeed intuitive and simple enough to be used by most users with no or little effort. This is especially proven by the results from studies at both elderly citizens homes, where the majority of participants were 65 years old or older.",

abstract="Numismatics sorts out historical aspects of money. Identification and classification of coins, as a part of their duties, need years of experience. This research aims at using the knowledge of numismatics for developing an image-based classification of ancient Sassanian dynasty coins. A straightforward method is to take coins observe and reverse-side motifs into account, just like numismatics does. To this aim, three feature descriptors, Cosine transform, Wavelet transform and Bi-Directional Principal Component Analysis, are separately applied to the extracted motifs' areas to form the feature space. To cope with the `curse of dimensionality' and increase the `discrimination power', feature space is enriched with spatial information achieved by applying a feature selection method. Indeed, the best feature subset, which maximizes the mutual information between the joint distribution of the selected features and the classification variable, is selected using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method to a trade-off between thousands of features and a few hundreds of samples. One fold of our contribution dedicates to decrease the over-fitting probability of the learning model by making the Sparse Representation-based Classifier kernelized. We evaluate our method on a dataset of 573 coin images. The experimental results show that our proposed image representation is more discriminative than the competitive ones in which the system achieves a mean classification rate of 96.51 {\%}.",

Furthermore, the channel responses for these three circuits are analysed in details to clarify the accurate inductive channels for data transmission that were defined alternatively in other papers. Besides, the effects of second neighbour interaction on inductive systems are also included in this work.

abstract="Chinese calligraphy is a unique visual art, and and is one of the material basis of China's traditional cultural heritage. However, time had caused the old calligraphy works to weathering and damages, so it is necessary to utilize advanced technologies to protect those works. One of those technologies is digital imaging, and the obtained images by digital imaging can preserve the visual information of calligraphy works better, furthermore, they can be used in further researches. While the basic works for those researches are to extract the artistic features which include two elements, i.e., form and spirit. However, most of the existing methods only extract the form and ignore the characters' spirit, especially they are insensitive to the slight variation in complex ink strokes. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an extraction method based on regional guided flter (RGF) with reference images, which is generated by KNN matting and used as the input image for RGF. Since RGF is sensitive to the slight variation of ink, so the detailed information of the inside of strokes can be detected better. Besides, unlike the past works, which filter the whole strokes, RGF filters the inside of strokes and edges in different windows respectively, which results in that the edges are preserved accurately. Results from a deployment of several famous Chinese calligraphy works demonstrate that our method can extract more accurate and complete form and spirit with lower error rate.",

This test bed is capable to evaluate performance in terms of data transmission and signal strength with bit error rate. The results show that perfect alignment is a main concern along with data transmission and signal strength. The transmission performance is different during the day and the night time. Moreover the results also show the performance of FSO at the indoor is up to the mark and very little or no jerks in the streaming data considering perfect alignment and a short distance. The FSO at short distance can be aligned perfectly without the alignment tools. However, for longer distance, it requires to be perfectly aligned with the tool. In case of perfect alignment and clear weather, the transfer rate is up to the mark, but the signal strength varies during the day and the night time which causes the delay in the transmission.

Therefore, it is not suitable for the CPS applications with long service range such as smart factory or smart environment monitoring. For these CPS applications, it is required to apply low power wide area network (LPWAN) to the sensor network. In this paper, LPWAN requirements for the CPS (i.e., the IoT-Cloud system) applications are analyzed and a radio management method for data transmission of LPWAN in the IoT-Cloud system is designed. For the validation of the efficiency of the data transmission, computer simulations are carried out. Results show that the proposed method outperforms state of the art methods. In this way, the proposal improves the transmission delay over TDMA in between 33 and 51{\%} depending on the number of sensors considered and presents a superior performance in the transmission of data packets.",

abstract="Face Super Resolution (FSR) is to infer High Resolution (HR) facial images from given Low Resolution (LR) ones with the assistance of LR and HR training pairs. Among existing methods, Neighbor Embedding(NE) FSR methods are superior in visual and objective quality than holistic based methods. These NE methods are based on the consistency assumption that the neighbors in HR/LR space form similar local geometry. But when LR images are in Very Low Quality (VLQ), the LR patches are seriously contaminated that even two distinct patches form similar appearance, which means that the consistency assumption is not well held anymore. To solve this problem, in this paper we use the target patch as well as the surrounding pixels, which we call parent patch, to represent the target patch. By incorporating the peripheral information, the parent patch is much more robust to noise in the LR and HR consistency learning. The effectiveness of proposed method is verified both quantitatively and qualitatively. In this paper, we also discuss the boundary and the paradox of the multi-scaled parent patch prior in NE based FSR framework.",

abstract="As an important boundary-based clustering algorithm, support vector clustering (SVC) benefits multiple applications for its capability of handling arbitrary cluster shapes. However, its popularity is degraded by both its highly intensive pricey computation and poor label performance which are due to redundant kernel function matrix required by estimating a support function and ineffectively checking segmers between all pairs of data points, respectively. To address these two problems, a fast and scalable SVC (FSSVC) method is proposed in this paper to achieve significant improvement on efficiency while guarantees a comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods. The heart of our approach includes (1) constructing the hypersphere and support function by cluster boundaries which prunes unnecessary computation and storage of kernel functions and (2) presenting an adaptive labeling strategy which decomposes clusters into convex hulls and then employs a convex-decomposition-based cluster labeling algorithm or cone cluster labeling algorithm on the basis of whether the radius of the hypersphere is greater than 1. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results (e.g., the first rank of a nonparametric statistical test) show the superiority of our method over the others, especially for large-scale data analysis under limited memory requirements.",

abstract="In this paper, a concentric circular array (CCA) is designed to provide feasible link between High-Altitude Platform (HAP)---which acts as a sink station---to sensor nodes placed on ground to form a Wireless Sensor Network. The proposed array design technique provides two types of coverage cells namely; wider coverage cell of 30 km radius and another smaller cell of 8 km radius. The link feasibility is examined for practical sensor models at two different frequencies (2.4 GHz and 868 MHz) and two corresponding bit rates (250 and 38.4 kbps) and shows the possibility of communications between the HAP and sensors at all scenarios. The CCA is optimized to improve the power gain inside the cell and reduce the out-of-cell sidelobe radiation using a modified Dolph-Chebyshev CCA. The comparison with conventional antenna models that give the same coverage radii shows that the link performance in terms of bit energy to noise power spectral density ratio can be improved by 11.37 dB for cells of 8 km radius and by 16.8 dB in the case of 30 km radius cells which make the link at 2.4 GHz to be feasible and realizable compared to using conventional antenna techniques.",

abstract="Infrared imaging has the advantage of all-weather working ability. Due to the limitation of the hardware and the high cost, the resolution of infrared image (IR) is very low. To improve the resolution of IR images, this paper exploits super-resolution (SR) method for IR images. A new SR framework by using random forests is proposed in this paper. Existing methods adopts single regression model for SR. However, which single regression model tends to overfit training data, and would lead to a poor performance. Furthermore, the existing methods are not suitable for real-time system due to the heavy time consuming. To resolve this problem, an ensemble regression model, i.e. random forests rather than single regression model is adopted in this paper. In addition, to achieve better results multi-regression models rather than a single regression model are trained on the clustered training data. Moreover, the features used in many SR methods cannot extract features on diagonal orientation. To resolve this problem, we adopt a second order derivative filter, which can extract features on diagonal orientation. The experimental results demonstrate the availability of the proposed method.",

Such implementation is especially feasible in HAP as, on a single HAP, multiple mobile cells are created and optimal resource allocation could be done, centrally. By varying the value of reserved channels and reserved channels for hand-off, we report that the probability of blocking of a new call and successful hand-off of an ongoing call is greatly improved.",

This technique adopts chaotic Baker map to improve the performance and reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signal. It helps improving the error resilient ability and also enhancing the efficiency of progressive image transmission over frequency selective fading channels. The proposed technique can effectively resist the fading impact of the frequency selective channels using simple frequency domain equalization. The proposed technique also utilizes the set partitioning in hierarchical trees as a source coding algorithm for the transmitted images. The distinctive feature of the proposed technique is that the transmitted data sequence has less data correlation, which leads to minimizing the PAPR. Simulation results show that the proposed technique improves the visual quality of the received images and reduces the PAPR of the OFDM signal as well.",

abstract="Sustaining independent living for elderly people in their own homes is desirable for various reasons. As older people become frail or disabled, a `gap' appears between the abilities they still have and the abilities that are required for independent living. To a certain extent robots may close this gap by providing functionality lost through frailty or disability. A scenario was created involving a re-enablement coach robot. This scenario was discussed with older people, informal carers, and care professionals in focus groups in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and France. The results provided insights into the acceptability of robots and showed that older people were open to the idea of having a robot supporting them in their daily life. Participants were also willing to have a robot perform higher level coordinating tasks while playing the role of the re-enablement coach. However, participants wanted the robot to operate at the same level of intelligence as a human carer. This implies that more attention needs to be given to the development of the social skills and behaviour of such robots. Additionally, participants acknowledged that such a robot would create tension between respecting the autonomy of the user (i.e. robot obeys all commands given by the user) and the promotion of independence in the long term (i.e. robot is programmed to maintain the abilities the user still has). Our results indicate that people preferred to resolve this tension in favour of autonomy. This choice, however, may decrease the user's abilities in the longer term and thereby undermine users' ability to live independently.",

abstract="In the modern society, the forms of disasters are getting larger and more diverse by abnormal weather phenomena due to rapid social changes. As human and economic damage is increasing by these disasters, interest in disaster observation and prevention is increasing and studies have been carried out in various fields. In order to minimize disaster damage, National Disaster Information Center provides disaster-related information such as disaster situations, risk index, local situation and so on. At present, however, various descriptive studies on action tips in the event of a disaster, disaster alert, disaster communications network have been in progress but there are few studies on prediction or simulation for preventing disasters etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a slope-based intelligent 3D disaster simulation using a physics engine. The proposed method is to infer a variety of disaster situations that may occur in reality through ontology and apply it to 3D simulation. Disaster situation ontology constitutes context information of outside, inside, disasters etc. and generates rule bases using Jena 2.0 inference engine. Inference results are derived in the form of XML and applicable to a variety of devices. The expression of 3D simulation virtual space is divided into interior and exterior. Interior constitutes the index information based on actually measured terrain and then expresses it into 3D compound type terrain data. Exterior expresses six planes into a hexahedron by using Sky Box technique. Simulation operates object collision, movement, surroundings etc. in real time by using a physics engine and represents a disaster situation in 3D virtual space by using particles function. Based on ontology based context awareness, environment context information on slope, including landslides, snow, rain, fogs, fire, explosion, and smoke, is developed into the slope based intelligent 3D disaster simulation. As a result, depending on geomorphic characteristics, disaster management service can realistically and visually be offered to users in 3D virtual reality. In addition, it is possible to experimentally apply disaster situations virtually through 3D virtual reality, and thereby judge their potential risk.",

abstract="A green cellular technology is proposed to optimize the energy and spectrum resources. Such optimization will require perfect channel state information at the transmitting base station. However, reporting the channel status of the entire bandwidth requires huge undesirable feedback overhead. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to optimize the energy and bandwidth resources while maintaining quality-of-service at the downlink when a partial feedback is considered. In this paper, a modified downlink scheduler based on a Packet Prediction Mechanism (PPM) is conducted at the eNodeB to optimize the energy and spectrum resources. On the user equipment side, a partial channel feedback scheme based on an adaptive feedback threshold is developed. A primary concern of this feedback scheme is to reduce the uplink signaling overhead without a substantial loss in downlink performances. Finally, the downlink packet scheduling and the partial feedback are jointly evaluated to further enhance the system performance. Based on a system-level simulation results, the proposed energy-efficient scheduling with partial feedback has achieved an improvement in EE of up to 79{\%} compared to the PPM scheduler. Besides, it minimizes the degradation caused by the partial channel quality indicator feedback. Thus, the proposed two-sided algorithm gives the best tradeoff between uplink and downlink performances.",

To configure these services for the desired user devices, a suitable configuration algorithm is needed. Therefore, this paper describes a QoS-adaptive service configuration approach to choose the optimal configuration for the preferred user devices in varied contexts so that the user can access the services ubiquitously.

abstract="The key management has a fundamental role in securing group communications taking place over vast and unprotected networks. It is concerned with the distribution and update of the keying materials whenever any changes occur in the group membership. Wireless mobile environments enable members to move freely within the networks, which causes more difficulty to design efficient and scalable key management protocols. This is partly because both member location dynamic and group membership dynamic must be managed concurrently, which may lead to significant rekeying overhead. This paper presents a hierarchical group key management scheme taking the mobility of members into consideration intended for wireless mobile environments. The proposed scheme supports the mobility of members across wireless mobile environments while remaining in the group session with minimum rekeying transmission overhead. Furthermore, the proposed scheme alleviates 1-affect-n phenomenon, single point of failure, and signaling load caused by moving members at the core network. Simulation results shows that the scheme surpasses other existing efforts in terms of communication overhead and affected members. The security requirements studies also show the backward and forward secrecy is preserved in the proposed scheme even though the members move between areas.",

abstract="A dedicated single short range communication link is not efficient for an inter-vehicular communication system and results into degraded performance. To address the problem, a cognitive radio site is proposed as an intelligent vehicular device to implement an inter-vehicular communication network using multiple radio access technologies. Further, the whitespace optimization at vehicular speed is achieved by the memory enabled genetic algorithm. The algorithm makes use of four cognitive radio decision variables as genes including frequency, power, data rate and modulation scheme in the chromosome structure. The performance of the proposed approach is validated against the classical genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. In this research, a statistical evaluation is also presented to confirm the potential of cognitive radio paradigm employing multiple radio access technologies as an option to fulfill the increasing bandwidth demand of an inter-vehicular communication system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by ensuring efficient bandwidth utilization and fulfilling varying nature of users' quality of service requirements in real time.",

abstract="Multi-dimensional Wireless sensor grids (WSG)s are deployed in complex environments to sense and collect data relating to multiple attributes (multi-dimensional data). Such networks present unique challenges to data dissemination, data storage of in-network information discovery. However, in order to fully exploit these networks for mission-critical applications, energy-efficient and scalable solutions for information discovery are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel and adaptive method for information discovery for multi-dimensional WSGs that can significantly increase network lifetime and minimize query processing latency, resulting in quality of service improvements that are of immense benefit to mission-critical applications. Further, we investigate efficient strategies for information discovery in large-scale wireless sensor networks and propose the Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Multi-Resolution Architecture (A-MDMRA) that efficiently combines ``push'' and ``pull'' strategies for information discovery. The A-MDMRA also adapts to variations in the frequencies of events and queries in the network to construct optimal routing structures. We present simulation results to show that the proposed approach to information discovery offers significant improvements on query resolution latency compared with current approaches. We observe that our proposed methods outperform existing schemes such as double rulings, comb needle and Time-Parameterized Data Centric Storage by up to 14{\%} in terms of query resolution latency and up to 20{\%} in terms of energy-efficiency.",

abstract="As the advent of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been increased, the protection of the information within the transmitted or stored video has become a big challenge. Most known drone systems attach metadata of the recorded video in separate files or in the header of the video. Current techniques make the metadata unsecure and easy to get lost and removed as well as it occupies more storage and bandwidth. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to hide the metadata of UAVs video using the technology of digital watermarking. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to implement the embedding of the information robustly. The middle frequencies coefficients reside on CH3 sub-band are utilized to hide the watermark bits. In addition, a new scrambling algorithm is proposed to secure the information before hiding. The adaption of the proposed video watermarking algorithm to hide the metadata of the UAV video is achieved. The experimental results prove the high performance of the proposed method. The method had unnoticeable impact on the video quality where the PSNR of 44 dB is attained. The experiments show that the method achieves high robustness under various attacks and provides enough capacity for metadata hiding of UAV video.",

abstract="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia, which mostly affects elderly people. Gradual loss in memory and declining cognitive functions are core symptoms associated with AD. Conventional brain images do not provide sufficient information to diagnose AD at an early stage. To delay the progression of memory impairment, there is a dire need to develop systems capable of early AD diagnosis. This paper describes a proposed fuzzy method for inferring the risk of dementia using the brain cortical thickness and hippocampus thickness. The aim is to develop a reliable index that allows the evaluation of brain health. The dementia index poses potential to become a biologically based biomarker for the clinical assessment of patient's dementia. Results show that the inference value of patient with mild cognitive impairment is significantly higher than that of healthy (control) or schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Our results suggest that a higher inference value indicates that the patient is at higher risk and is more likely to eventually progress to AD. The system is also tested with age-associated memory impairment patients. The results confirm that our model is able to distinguish between these four patient groups.",

abstract="Discriminant analysis technique plays an important role in face recognition because it can extract discriminative features to classify different persons. However, most existing discriminant analysis methods fail to work for single image per person problem (SIPPP) because there is only a single training sample per person such that the within-class variation of this person cannot be calculated in such case. In this paper, we present a new face recognition method for SIPPP. The method is a combination of Gabor wavelets, feature space transformation (FST) based on fusion feature matrix, and nearest neighbor classifier (NNc). First, we use Gabor wavelets to extract the feature vectors from a raw training sample image, because Gabor-based features are more robust than spectral-based features and could avoid the local distortions caused by the variance of expression, pose, light and noise. Then, the extracted spatial-based feature vectors and spectral-based feature vectors are combined, and projected to a low-dimensional subspace by using dimensionality reduction techniques. Finally, the classification can be completed via using NNc. The proposed method is abbreviated as G-FST. The performance of G-FST method is evaluated on ORL, Yale and FERET databases. Experimental results show that the G-FST method outperforms the other related methods in terms of recognition rates and recognition time.",

abstract="Automatic violence detection from video is a hot topic for many video surveillance applications. However, there has been little success in designing an algorithm that can detect violence in surveillance videos with high performance. Existing methods typically apply the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model on local spatiotemporal descriptors. However, traditional spatiotemporal features are not discriminative enough, and also the BoW model roughly assigns each feature vector to only one visual word and therefore ignores the spatial relationships among the features. To tackle these problems, in this paper we propose a novel Motion Weber Local Descriptor (MoWLD) in the spirit of the well-known WLD and make it a powerful and robust descriptor for motion images. We extend the WLD spatial descriptions by adding a temporal component to the appearance descriptor, which implicitly captures local motion information as well as low-level image appear information. To eliminate redundant and irrelevant features, the non-parametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is employed on the MoWLD descriptor. In order to obtain more discriminative features, we adopt the sparse coding and max pooling scheme to further process the selected MoWLDs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-arts.",

In the field trial, the LTE network shared the spectrum with a program making and special events Incumbent. New LSA concept elements, LSA Repository for Incumbent protection information and LSA Controller for controlling the mobile broadband network in the same spectrum band were implemented in the trial environment. The trial utilized commercially available network elements like multimode multiband terminals, LTE base stations, core network and network management system. Incumbent spectrum usage data was collected to the LSA repository, which further converts it to spectrum availability information for the LSA controller. The trial goes beyond previous LSA demonstrations by presenting LSA controller power control concept algorithm that formulate the optimization objective as a function of base station cell transmit powers. An advantage of this procedure is that considering aggregated interference from the LTE network to Incumbent and adjusting the transmit power levels do not result in abrupt changes in the received signal quality and results better overall throughput. The developed LSA controller was implemented as self-organizing network solution integrated into network management system. Numerical results are presented to quantify the duration of the LSA procedure flow. The performance results on the LSA system workflow indicated that in the program, making special event use case the LSA band can be managed timely manner and the Incumbents' rights can be protected.",

abstract="Electricity usage at electricity rush hour (peak hour) may vary from each and every service area such as industrial area, commercial area and residential area. Equalizing the power consumption in industry may lead to the utilization of power in other service areas in an efficient way. Although industries have comparably lesser number of power consuming device types than other service areas the power consumption is quite high. To meet the demands rising in the industry, shiftable loads (devices) can be redistributed equally to all the working time slots based on the average power utilization. It can be done in a flexible manner by shaping the loads using Demand Side Management (DSM) technique in Smart Grid. The main objective is to minimize the power utilization during the electricity rush hour by effectively distributing the power available during off-peak hour. Evolutionary algorithm can be well adapted to problems where optimization is the core criteria. Any maximization or minimization problem can be solved efficiently using evolutionary algorithm. Hence, to obtain the optimized fitness function of load redistribution in industry Genetic Algorithm in Demand Side Management (GA-DSM) is chosen and it has benefited with an overall reduction of 21.91{\%} which is very remarkable. In addition to this the evaluation of the fitness function using GA-DSM is carried out in other two industrial dataset models (steel plant and wind power plant) which is unavailable so far in the literature.",

abstract="Learning dictionaries from the training data has led to promising results for pattern classification tasks. Dimensionality reduction is also an important issue for pattern classification. However, most existing methods perform dimensionality reduction (DR) and dictionary learning (DL) independently, which may result in not fully exploiting the discriminative information of the training data. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous dimensionality reduction and dictionary learning (SDRDL) model to learn a DR projection matrix and a class-specific dictionary (i.e., the dictionary atoms correspond to the class labels) simultaneously. Since simultaneously learning makes the learned projection and dictionary fit better with each other, more effective pattern classification can be achieved using the representation residual. In SDRDL model, not only the representation residual is discriminative, but the representation coefficients are also discriminative. Therefore, a classification scheme associated with SDRDL is presented by exploiting such discriminative information. Experimental results on a series of benchmark image databases show that our proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art discriminative dictionary learning methods.",

abstract="This paper presents a reconfigurable architecture for two video coding standards, MPEG-2 and AVC/H.264. The proposed reconfigurable architecture dynamically configures the architecture to achieve multiple functions in variable length coding decoder and context-adaptive variable length coding decoder. By means of extracting the commonalities at the low-level dataflow, the designed reconfigurable architecture optimizes hardware resources and increases architectural flexibility through the reconfigurability in the adaptively constructing architecture. On the other hand, the proposed reconfigurable architecture combines several strategies in AVC/H.264 mode, and subsequently revises and integrates these mechanisms to achieve a high-throughput rate. As a consequence, the memory usage of the proposed reconfigurable architecture achieves 37.5 {\%} memory bits saving and 46.7 {\%} memory area reduction as compared to the individual implementation; moreover, in AVC/H.264 mode, this reconfigurable architecture requires only 50 cycles to decode one marcoblock on average. Due to the flexibility, the proposed reconfigurable architecture costs 10.8 K gates by using 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS technology at the 108 MHz clock rate, and supports variable length coding in MPEG-2 with 1920{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}1080@30fps and context-adaptive variable length coding in AVC/H.264 with 1920{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}1080@60fps. From the perspectives of architectural costs and supported functions, the proposed architecture surpasses the related works in the state of the art.",

abstract="Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a salient component in the area of cognitive radio, signal detection, interference identification, electronic warfare, spectrum management and surveillance. The majority of the existing signals detection and classification methods presume that the received signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The performance of the modulation classification algorithms degrades severely under the non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a robust algorithm to identify the modulation type of digital signal contaminated with non-Gaussian impulse noise and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) using a sparse signal decomposition on hybrid dictionary. The algorithm first detects and removes the impulse noise using sparse signal decomposition thereafter it classifies the modulation schemes using cyclostationary feature extraction algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method under different non-Gaussian impulse noise and AWGN conditions. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated using well known classifiers available in the literature.",

abstract="The deployment of 3G/LTE networks and advancements in smart mobile devices had led to high demand for multimedia streaming over wireless network. The rapid increasing demand for multimedia content poses challenges for all parties in a multimedia streaming system, namely, content providers, wireless network service providers, and smart device makers. Content providers and mobile network service providers are both striving to improve their streaming services while utilizing advancing technologies. Smart device makers endeavor to improve processing power and displays for better viewing experience. Ultimately, the common goal shared by content providers, network service providers, and smart device manufactures is to improve the QoE for users. QoE is both an objective and a subjective metric measuring the streaming quality experience by end users. It may be measured by streaming bitrate, playback smoothness, video quality metrics like Peak to Signal Noise Ratio, and other user satisfaction factors. There have been efforts made to improve the streaming experiences in all these aspects. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing literatures on QoE of video streaming to gain a deeper and more complete understanding of QoE quality metrics. The goal is to inspire new research directions in defining better QoE and improving QoE in existing and new streaming services such as adaptive streaming and 3D video streaming.",

In order to extract more discriminative and robust feature for face recognition, the IWBC is proposed to encode the cues embedded in IWLD. Moreover, to reduce the dimension of feature extracted by IWBC and enhance its discriminative ability, the block-based Fishers linear discriminant (BFLD) is employed to learn a projection matrix from the training set. Experimental results on three (AR, FERET and PolyU-NIR) challenging databases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.",

We defined the various features of each texel such as its height, slope angle, slope direction, surface curvature, hue, saturation and brightness from the training datasets. The proposed method makes possible for mapping texture of a realistic ortho-photo data to virtual terrain data which are unable to take satellite photo or aerial photo. These case are often in of computer game and digital movie area. Also, generating ortho-photo with the enlarged DEM, it does not cause the aliasing from the difference of resolution. It makes very similar images with real photography by shading and efficiently handles ortho-photo data and elevation data occupied enormous storage in cloud computing environment.",

In this study, teaching performance and student learning experience are measured using real-time multimedia processing tools and techniques for the e-learning paradigm. Visual attention and visual engagement analysis are performed using two developed algorithms. Video lectures are recorded and delivered to students in e-learning pedagogical setup, which are examined for the visual attention and visual engagement of the student and teacher, respectively. Proposed methodology integrates the assessment on both student and teacher ends. Multimedia processing of video lectures for teaching performance produces scoring dataset. The same methodology on student end for visual attention is used to investigate student experience. These types of datasets then reduced to time-based datasets from the image-based dataset. Correlation and association of both datasets provide the opportunity to relate both student experience and teaching performance as well as to move forward to create content that is more useful. Computational performance of the developed algorithms is compared using different video lectures with their processed frames per second, which is analyzed as per their corresponding bins.

abstract="Violence detection is a hot topic for surveillance systems. However, it has not been studied as much as for action recognition. Existing vision-based methods mainly concentrate on violence detection and make little effort to determine the location of violence. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust framework for detecting and localizing violence in surveillance scenes. For this purpose, a Gaussian Model of Optical Flow (GMOF) is proposed to extract candidate violence regions, which are adaptively modeled as a deviation from the normal behavior of crowd observed in the scene. Violence detection is then performed on each video volume constructed by densely sampling the candidate violence regions. To distinguish violent events from nonviolent events, we also propose a novel descriptor, named as Orientation Histogram of Optical Flow (OHOF), which are fed into a linear SVM for classification. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both detection accuracy and processing speed, even in crowded scenes.",

abstract="In wireless sensor networks, nodes usually construct tree structure in any monitored area to enable data aggregation and to transmit aggregated data by multi-hopping through neighbors to a remote sink (BS) which results in significant energy savings. Further- more, a captured sensor node might generate a fictitious data and misguide the Sink (BS). Hence, secure communication between nodes have generally vital importance. Secret shared keys are needed to be established among sensor nodes for secure communication among them. In the present work a new algorithm is introduced to construct such a tree of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. This algorithm implements a sleep/wake scheduling technique to keep redundant nodes inactive while maintaining initial sensing coverage with active nodes. Redundant nodes can replace the failure nodes to keep network tasks that enhances the network lifetime by efficient utilization. Hence the objective of this research work is to jointly design the scheme for sensor scheduling, tree construction with active nodes, and secret pair-wise keys establishment with their parent and children such that the network lifetime can be maximized. Thereafter, sensor nodes communicate with each other securely using secret pair-wise keys.",

abstract="Enhancement to clean speech from noisy speech has always been a challenging issue for the researcher's community. Various researchers have used different techniques to resolve this problem. These techniques can be classified into the unsupervised and supervised approaches. Amongst the unsupervised approaches, Spectral Subtraction and Wiener Filter are commonly exploited. However, such approaches do not yield significant enhancement in the speech quality as well as intelligibility. As compared to unsupervised, supervised approaches such as Hidden Markov Model produces enhanced speech signals with better quality. However, supervised approaches need prior knowledge about the type of noise which is considered their major drawback. Moreover, for each noise type, separate models need to be trained. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach for the enhancement of speech is presented to overcome the limitations of both supervised and unsupervised approaches. The filter weights adjustment on the basis of Delta Learning Rule makes it a supervised approach. To address the issue of construction of new model for each noise type, the filter adjusts its weights automatically through minimum mean square error. It is unsupervised as there is no need of estimation of noise power spectral density. Various experiments are performed to test the performance of proposed filter with respect to different parameters. Moreover, the performance of the proposed filter is compared with state-of-the-art approaches using objective and subjective measures. The results indicate that CEGAF outperforms the algorithms such as Wiener Filter, supervised NMF and online NMF.",
