abstract="As information technology and telecommunication systems continue to grow in size and complexity, especially with the Internet of Things (IoT) domain that is being hailed as the next industrial revolution, emerging technologies have to anticipate this dramatic increase of heterogeneous connected devices. This paper proposes a solution that can be used to manage this huge number of devices, by classifying them and predicting their device's type, based on their specifications. Four (4) classification algorithms are being applied on a dataset containing the specifications of known devices (in terms of known device type), which is being used for predicting the unknown devices' types. These algorithms are analyzed using the WEKA data mining tool and a comparative study is undertaken to find the classifier that performs the best analysis on the dataset obtained, using a set of predefined performance metrics to compare the results of each classifier.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes very important tool for data gathering and management in many environments. The majority of dedicated solutions register data only at time of events, while in case of medical data full records for long time periods are usually needed. The precision of acquired data and the amount of data sent by sensor-equipped IoT devices has vital impact on lifetime of these devices. In case of solutions, where multiple sensors are available for single device with limited computation power and memory, the complex compression or transformation methods cannot be applied - especially in case of nano device injected to a body. Thus this paper is focused on linear complexity segmentation algorithms that can be used by the resource-limited devices. The state-of-art data segmentation methods are analysed and adapted for simple IoT devices. Two segmentation algorithms are proposed and tested on a real-world dataset collected from a prototype of the IoT device.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions and services may be used to support and extend the independent living of older adults in their living environments by responding to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities. Telemedicine and telehealth platforms areÂ among the various types of IoT services that could support the provision of health services. Current Health Technology Assessment (HTA) models that are used for the evaluation of telehealth and telemedicine services do not consider IoT aspects. HTA models would ideally need to be extended to include IoT platforms, for an optimal introduction of IoT in everyday provision of health and care services. This paper presents an initial adaptation of the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST) for IoT Telemedicine services based on a literature review of IoT, telemedicine and telehealth services characteristics. MAST involves assessment of outcomes within the following seven domains: Health problem and characteristics of the application, Safety, Clinical effectiveness, Patient perspectives, Economic aspects, Organizational aspects, Socio-cultural, ethical and legal aspects. The domains of the characteristics of the application, socio-cultural, safety and ethical and legal aspects were identified as those to be adapted to cover new challenges associated to IoT services.",

abstract="As Internet of Things (IoT) is entering mainstream, data privacy and security in information exchange becomes a major concern and a barrier for potential adopters, especially in healthcare regime. Information from health IoT devices and services is sensitive and confidential. While many existing works have proposed enhancements and security prospects for individual devices and components in IoT ecosystems, they still do not address the underlying challenge which is the lack of sufficient security within systems. Effective security has to be built-in, not patched upon. To efficaciously tackle the challenge in distributed IoT systems, we present a security context framework which applies adaptive security contexts to properly track data of interest. The proposed solution can achieve accountability and track information propagation, involving devices, services and parties who have responsibility and potential legal liability. This could help leverage not just technical but also policy and legal aspects to enable health IoT adoption.",

abstract="The EU funded project inCASA has brought new insights in the field of socio-medical technology using the context-aware LinkSmart middleware. One of the main concerns that were experienced was whether separate medical devices could aggregate contextual information given by multiple environmental sensors within social care. Energy profiles were hypothesised to be able to substitute many of these in exchange for context information about a patient's behaviour. A small study was conducted to review the energy profiles given by medical devices at dispose. Unluckily, the results showed that the medical devices do not expose relevant information in order to construct such profiles.",

abstract="Recent evolution of wearable devices is primarily focused on physical health and fitness but ignore emotional health aspects of an individual. Current health services help user define goals ``Reduce weight'' but do not provide interfaces for users to define goals as ``Stay Happy''. Lot of existing research has focused on sensing user mood classification based on device data but there is limited research that has focused to diagnose and heal depression. A conventional method of doctors detecting depression is based on Hamilton scale of depression with a set of questions and is an intrusive method to probe depression patients. IoT devices are slowly gaining popularity and huge data that is generated from these devices can be leveraged to determine user emotional health. Proposed method attempts to analyze IoT device data and calculate user depression scale and recommends relevant social communication with user social contacts (Friends, Family Members). Identifying precise social contacts and recommending actions and content to recover from early stages of depression is one of the goals of the proposed system. Method recommends relevant social contacts based on current depression score. Proposed system tries to monitor user's emotional state and more tries to act as preventive health assistant to correct emotional states in early stages and avoids user moving to advanced stages of depression.",
