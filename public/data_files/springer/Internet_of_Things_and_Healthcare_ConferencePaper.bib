abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in a broad range of healthcare applications. However, so far this effort is mainly restricted to actual patients actively undergoing treatment. From the perspective of IoT, these kinds of efforts should spread to the preventive activity of healthy people in the not-so-distant future. Healthy people, whose population is much larger than patients, presumably have various latent needs or wants for an IoT-driven healthcare system, compared with the actual patients. Discerning the real needs from the latent needs of healthy people for preventive care is the key to build up an innovative and favorable IoT-based system. This research tackled this problem from the product device side. We utilized multiple analyses including cluster analysis, graphical modeling, and text-mining, in order to extract from survey data real and useful consumer needs, which can be expected to propel the innovation of health-related home electronics. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by a case study using practical questionnaire data, while selecting a blood-pressure monitor and a sleep monitor as case study examples.",

abstract="In recent years, increasing costs in Health Care have directed efforts for more effective resource management in hospitals. ``Internet of Things'' is a very important step towards an increased networking state of hospital inventory. The use of RFID and IPv6 allows for a low cost, low maintenance solution. The above combination also helps to develop a transparent information infrastructure that serves the health professional and the patient alike. Apart from the obvious advantages of IPv6 such as larger address space (128 bits long), better header format, provision for extension, resource allocation support (Flow Label) and security features and the RFID's no line of sight requirement, long read range, real-time tracking, multiple tag read/write and database portability, the combination of the two and our proposed Virtual MAC Address Generator can provide a unique tracking, low-cost, low power tool in a multi-sensor hospital environment.",

Hence, the IoT (Internet of Things) is emerged as a recent trend in healthcare communication systems. IoT serves as a catalyst for the healthcare and plays a major role in numerous healthcare applications. Wearable sensors recognize anomalous and unforeseen conditions by examining physiological parameters along with the symptoms and transfers the vital signs for medical evaluation. Hence, prompt provisional medication can be done immediately to avoid severe conditions. In the proposed system, a microcontroller is used as a gateway to communicate to the several sensors depending on parameters to be monitored such as pulse rate counter, temperature sensor, accelerometer, etc. The microcontroller acquires the sensor data, processes it, and transmits to the network through appropriate data transmission protocol, successively providing a real-time monitoring of the healthcare parameters for healthcare professionals. The doctor can access the data anytime by simply logging to the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) webpage or typing the corresponding unique IP (Internet protocol) address in Internet browser.",

abstract="Early warning score (EWS) is a prediction method to notify caregivers at a hospital about the deterioration of a patient. Deterioration can be identified by detecting abnormalities in patient's vital signs several hours prior the condition of the patient gets life-threatening. In the existing EWS systems, monitoring of patient's vital signs and the determining the score is mostly performed in a paper and pen based way. Furthermore, currently it is done solely in a hospital environment. In this paper, we propose to import this system to patients' home to provide an automated platform which not only monitors patents' vital signs but also looks over his/her activities and the surrounding environment. Thanks to the Internet-of-Things technology, we present an intelligent early warning method to remotely monitor in-home patients and generate alerts in case of different medical emergencies or radical changes in condition of the patient. We also demonstrate an early warning score analysis system which continuously performs sensing, transferring, and recording vital signs, activity-related data, and environmental parameters.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) evolves very rapidly over time, since everything such as sensors/actuators linked together from around the world with use of evolution of ubiquitous computing through the Internet. These devices have a unique IP address in order to communicate with each other and transmit data with features of wireless technologies. Fog computing or so called edge computing brings all Cloud features to embedded devices at edge network and adds more features to servers like pre-store data of Cloud, fast response, and generate overhasty users reporting. Fog mediates between Cloud and IoT devices and thus enables new types of computing and services. The future applications take the advantage of combing the two concepts Fog and Cloud in order to provide low delay Fog-based and high capacity of storage Cloud-based. This paper proposes an IoT architecture for healthcare network based on Fog to Cloud and Data in Motion (F2CDM). The proposed architecture is designed and implemented over three sites: Site 1 contains the embedded devices layer, Site 2 consists of the Fog network layer, while Site 3 consists of the Cloud network. The Fog layer is represented by a middleware server in Al-Nahrain University with temporary storage such that the data lives inside for 30 min. During this time, the selection of up-normality in behavior is send to the Cloud while the rest of the data is wiped out. On the other hand, the Cloud stores all the incoming data from Fog permanently. The F2CDM works using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for fast response. The results show that all data can be monitored from the Fog in real time while the critical data can be monitored from Cloud. In addition, the response time is evaluated using traffic generator called Tsung. It has been found that the proposed architecture reduces traffic on Cloud network and provides better data analysis.",

However, the large majority of the current IoT research and development expects that the IoT ``things'' communicate wirelessly, leaving the question of their energy supply and communication reliability more-or-less open. The obvious alternative, wire line, has gained much less attention, perhaps since it is too well known. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient IoT architecture for healthcare applications that leverages clinical and home care scenarios, given their typically fixed, stationary nature, as the mobility of patients is in many cases confined to a room or a building. The architecture is based on intelligent, wired gateways that are power-efficient and low-cost. The gateways link wired/wireless medical sensors and hospital appliances to web services, enabling hospital automation and widespread data collection and aggregation of vital signs in a convenient, and cost-effective approach.",

A validation test bed involving 31 elderly people living in Lecce (Italy) has been carried out for the monitoring of their activities, mainly those connected to positioning and motility both in indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our approach has demonstrated a practical way to replace obtrusive monitoring technique (typical of caregivers) with unobtrusive ones, in order to obtain proactive intervention strategies for a smart city.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is the tomorrow's Internet. It is being used in our everyday life where objects possessing sensing capabilities such as users, computing systems, and others are combined for convenience and economic benefits. Connecting various such devices is a challenging activity, as each device can have its architecture and security concerns. Various proposals are available in the literature to connect devices effectively, and various systems are there in the markets that are using this IoT concept. Hence dealing with all such interacting devices would be a challenging task when it comes to security. Also, various proposals are available that list the security issues present in IoT, but they are not defining the security requirements clearly for IoT. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to list the main security challenges for IoT and define the security requirements for IoT healthcare system.",

abstract="Emotions and physical health are strongly related. A first step towards emotional well-being is to monitor, understand and reflect upon one's feelings and emotions. A number of personal emotion-tracking applications are available today. In this paper we describe an examination of these applications which indicates that many of the applications do not provide sufficient support for monitoring a full spectrum of emotional data or for analyzing or using the data that is provided. To design applications that better support emotional well-being, the full capabilities of the Internet of Things should be utilized. The paper concludes with a description of how Internet of Things technologies can enable the development of systems that can more accurately capture emotional data and support personal learning in the area of emotional health.",

Physical data is rapidly changing which makes it important to keep networking connections active. Any drop in communication can lead to the loss of sensitive data. A redundant network connection is an attempt to utilize common networking solutions in order to decrease the likelihood of network downtime. It does this by adding a new level of abstraction to networking, allowing data to be sent over multiple networking solutions as if it were a single network, as well as an intelligent decision engine to determine the most optimized and reliable connection to use dynamically.",

At the current implementation, IoT is being implemented for assorted scenarios including environmental monitoring, production, manufacturing, healthcare, home automations, transportations, and many others. The key idea behind IoT is the machine to machine communication in which each and every device is connected using sensor technology. This paradigm is used for the development and deployment of smart cities and sensor-based infrastructures. Nowadays, IoT is being implemented in many of the transportation services and integrated in cars as well as freight vehicles which make it IoV (Internet of Vehicles). Using this approach, the remote IoT control servers can monitor any of the moving vehicles in real time and tracking can be done on multiple parameters. In the classical implementation, the remote monitoring and tracking is one using towers or base stations and satellites which is not very effective because of assorted quality of service factors. For the enhanced scenario integration, the global positioning system is used but number of security vulnerabilities can be there and cracking can be done.

The lack of deployed applications, however, renders it difficult to evaluate potential security risks, which is further complicated by the presence of novel, IoT-specific risks absent in conventional systems. In this work, we present two-part study that uses scenario planning to evaluate emerging risks of IoT in a variety of financial products and services, using ISO/IEC 20005:2008 to assess those risks from related work. Over 1,400 risks were evaluated from a risk assessment with 7 security professionals within the financial industry, which was contrasted with an external survey of 40 professionals within academia and industry. From this, we draw a range of insights to advise future IoT research and decision-making regarding potentially under-appreciated risks. To our knowledge, we provide the first empirical investigation for which threats, vulnerabilities, asset classes and, ultimately, risks may take precedence in this domain.",

Therefore, how to address security problem in RFID system is a crucial issue for the security of the IoT. The RFID authentication protocol is a key cryptographic protocol ensuring communication security because it could provide authentication between the tag and the server. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication protocols were studied widely because they could provide better security attributes compared with traditional RFID authentications. Lv et al. proposed three ECC-based RFID protocols and claimed their protocols could overcome weaknesses in previous protocols. Unfortunately, in this paper, we show that Lv et al.'s protocols cannot withstand the man-in-the-middle attack.

The objectives for this research include: (1) summarizing the current business models for IoT, (2) analyzing the impact of IoT on software business models (3) analyzing the impact of IoT on requirements engineering. We conducted a systematic snowballing literature review, followed by an industrial survey. We identified 21 peer reviewed papers which were analyzed in relation to their rigor and relevance and received 56 survey responses. The results of the literature review indicate 9 business model elements that IoT literature focus on. Morevoer, 4 business model aspects were described with respect to the business model structure, context and governance. The industrial survey results highlighted that value proposition, followed by customer segmentation and revenue streams were the most important business model elements for IoT. Moreover, the survey results suggest that requirement management, requirement prioritization and requirement modeling and analysis are highly impacted by IoT.",

abstract="Water source is necessary and an important factor in agricultural and farm production and is a key of our quality of life as well. Monitoring water level of a water source, such as water tank or borewell etc., plays a key role in agricultural. For example if a water level drops below the threshold level for pumping in a borewell, the pump motor may get damaged due to dry running. In such case monitoring water level and controlling the water pump accordingly becomes necessary task. There are many other situations where water level monitoring is an important task. It may be used to preserve water or to study the water usage of a water source. This paper proposes a prototype system design, implementation and description of required tools and technologies to develop Internet of Things (IoT) based water level monitoring system which can be implemented in future smart villages in India.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) vision is a groundbreaking networking evolution that connects all things that were not meant to be connected to the Internet. Thus, identification technologies and Internet-enabled wireless sensor nodes will be incorporated in homes, cities, vehicles, watches, etc. making them uniquely identified and able to process and communicate information via Internet. Hence, the emergence of the Internet of Things paradigm will bring a lot of smartness to our daily life and will improve the way people monitor their goods, expenses, environment and health status. The smart connected things in the IoT interact with each other and/or with the regular Internet hosts according to two communications styles: Thing-to-Thing(s) (T2T) and Human-to-Thing (H2T). Enabling security for such communications is a real issue especially in H2T interactions. This is mainly due to scarce resources of the connected objects and the asymmetric nature of the communications between those smart things and the ordinary Internet hosts. In this paper we address this problematic and we propose an asymmetric security model that mitigates H2T communication heterogeneities and provides reasonable security costs.",

abstract="The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is today a reality, and Smart Systems have taken advantage of this to improve its own sense, act and control capabilities. IoT is a highly heterogeneous environment composed by a vast number of ``things'' (sensors, smart objects, etc.). These ``things'' are based on hardware platforms which can differ widely since manufactures are being capable of develop new devices every day to tackle different application domains. Consequently, a problem emerges regarding which will be the suitable, proper hardware solution for an IoT deployment. Make a right decision is probably one of the toughest challenges for science and technology managers. This work proposes a novel methodology to analyze a set of hardware alternatives based on user's multi-criteria requirements, and advice on the more suitable hardware solution for a specific situation. For proof-of-concept it is used different Arduino boards as hardware alternatives, in which user requirements are based on hardware features. This methodology foresees its use during the development of Smart Systems (e.g.: Transportation, Healthcare) to optimize the selection of hardware platforms.",

With IoT infrastructure, physical objects such as wearable objects, television, refrigerator, smart phones, supply-chain items and any objects across the globe would get connected using the Internet. Sensing, radio waves, mobile technology, embedded systems and Internet technology are promising actors which play significant roles in IoT infrastructure. Security and privacy issues in IoT scenarios would be much more challenging than what is been used in the conventional wireless scenarios. In particular, the constrained environments require lightweight primitives, secure design and effective integration into other environments in order to see IoT in its desired shape. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy challenges in IoT scenarios and applications with special emphasis on resource-constrained environments' security objectives and privacy requirement. We provide different perspectives of IoT, discuss about important driving forces of IoT, and propose a generic construction of secure protocol suitable for constrained environments with respect to IoT scenarios and applications.",

We took readings in each of these environments such as an indoor Basketball Court, an Auditorium, and a room (our lab) and to verify results in outdoor conditions we chose parking lot as one of the testing environments.

This development has resulted in numerous approaches being proposed for harnessing IoT for smart city applications. Having received a significant attention by the research community and industry, IoT adaptation has gained momentum. IoT-enabled applications are being rapidly developed in a number of domains such as energy management, waste management, traffic control, mobility, healthcare, ambient assisted living, etc. On the other hand, this high-speed development and adaptation has resulted in the emergence of heterogeneous IoT architectures, standards, middlewares, and applications. This heterogeneity is hindrance in the realization of a much anticipated IoT global eco-system. Hence, the heterogeneity (from hardware level to application level) is a critical issue that needs high-priority and must be resolved as early as possible.

First, we give the brief motivation for integration work and reference the visionary Smart Life scenario of hypothetic personas' day from the year 2020. Presentation of identified security and privacy concerns of IoT deployments follows Smart Life scenario because of inevitable direct impact on large number of human end-users. Development objectives towards integration of heterogeneous IoT systems follow the defined scenario and are accompanied by IoT technical feasibility and user feedback validation targets and measurement values for the four to-be-deployed IoT applications. The architectural system overview of technological enablers of interoperability and interconnection between and within IoT applications are also important parts of the on-going research. The IoT application example gives an understanding on applicability of previously described considerations particularly in Smart Home domain. We round off with discussion on our developments at the end.",

Due to the massive amount of data generated in workflows of IoT applications, data science plays a key role in their quality assurance. In this paper, we present respective data science challenges to improve quality assurance of Internet of Things applications. Based on an informal literature review, we first outline quality assurance requirements evolving with the IoT grouped into six categories (Environment, User, Compliance/Service Level Agreement, Organizational, Security and Data Management). Finally, we present data science challenges to improve the quality assurance of Internet of Things applications sub-divided into four categories (Defect prevention, Defect analysis, User incorporation and Organizational) derived from the six quality assurance requirement categories.",

abstract="With significant technological developments as well as advances in sensors, wireless communications and Internet -- a lot of research areas have emerged, such as wearable computing, context-aware homes, mobile phone sensing and smart vehicle systems. From those emerging areas, there is a clear trend to augment the physical devices/objects with sensing, computing {\&} communication capabilities, connect them together to form a network and make use of the collective effect of networked smart things − the Internet of Things(IoT). This paper proposes the IoT architecture ``Kaivalyam'' for sensors/actuator. The configurable interface generates the identity of the `Thing' and stores in 32-bit datagram. The various configuration of the 32-bit datagram from 4,8,12 and 16-bit device data and respective 14, 12, 10 and 8-bits duplicate identifier can scale the number of devices connected to design platform. These datagram's read into FIFO of the Triple Speed Ethernet (TSE) for transmission using Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) encoder. Simulation studies for the system were performed for block length 512 bits, which is the minimum Ethernet frame length of 64 bytes. AWGN(Additive White Gaussian Noise) is introduced in the channel and BER(Bit Error Rate) is computed for different (1dB to 6dB) SNR(Signal to Noise Ratio) showing BER of 10-4 -4 to 10-5 can be achieved for SNR of 2.5 dB indicating the secured and reliable data transmission.",

A very important aspect in IoT applications is the communication protocols used by sensors for sending and exchange information. Traditional protocols used so far do not have the scope and ability to manage a growing up computational elements used in modern IoT applications. New communications schemes based on spread spectrum and Long Range (LoRa) coverage, offer new horizons for design and implement low power and long-range sensor networks. In this paper, we describe a new, robust and lightweight communication protocol implemented over the physical layer of LoRa, providing effectiveness and low power consumption suitable for IoT applications. A coverage analysis in both urban and rural environments confirms the success in the selection of this technology and opens new challenges for developing useful applications in several domains as for example smart cities, smart-health, smart factory, remote monitoring, precision agriculture, energy management and remote monitoring and control.",

On the other hand, such users need an environment in which they can express proper requirements for enabling the system to react autonomously according to events in the real/physical world, by running processes that trigger actions and perform services. In this paper, we provide the design of a web environment that we are developing around the concept of event, that is simple or complex data streams gathered from physical and social sensors that are encapsulated with contextual information (space, time, thematic). Moreover, from a study of the most diffused applications for Internet of Things that provide the user with tools for controlling the combination of data streams coming from devices and sensors, we identify and discuss some open problems and proposes a new paradigm and language to address them and to be integrated in our web environment.",

abstract="Internet of Things enables every node on a personal network to be managed and monitored remotely over the Internet. Biometric devices, used for access control or as bio-sensors, form a critical part of Internet of Things and are identified using IPv6 address. Malicious users can track activity of these devices by spoofing IPv6 addresses from unsecure wireless communication channels. Tracking device activity and identifying user behavior of the device poses a great threat to device identity and data generated by it. Such a threat can be avoided by keeping the device's IPv6 address hidden from attacker. This study proposes a method to privacy enable IPv6 address configuration for connected devices in general and biometric devices in particular, while connected as a part of Internet of Things. It is proposed that by changing the device's IPv6 address periodically and pseudorandomly, its identity can be kept private to a large extent. These address changes are configured on devices based on congruence classes, which generate non-repeatable integer sequence. It is proposed that the interface identification part of IPv6 address is configured with two-level hierarchy with each level level using a different congruence class. Such configuration generates different identification values to ensure conflict free address configuration. The proposition is analyzed for privacy preserving property and communication cost. The results of performance benchmarking using Cooja simulator show that the method does not impose substantial communication overhead on IPv6 address configuration process.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Experience-Oriented Smart Things that allows experiential knowledge discovery, storage, involving, and sharing for Internet of Things. The main features, architecture, and initial experiments of this approach are introduced. Rather than take all the data produced by Internet of Things, this approach focuses on acquiring only interesting data for its knowledge discovery process. By catching decision events, this approach gathers its own daily operation experience, which is the interesting data, and uses such experience for knowledge discovery. An initial experiment was made at the end of this paper, by applying this approach to a sensors-equipped bicycle, the bicycle is able to learn user's physical features and recognize its user out of other riders. Customized version of Decisional DNA is used in this approach as the knowledge representation technique. Decisional DNA is a domain-independent, and flexible, and standard experiential knowledge repository solution that allows knowledge to be acquired, reused, evolved and shared easily. The presented conceptual approach demonstrates how knowledge can be discovered through its domain's experiences and stored as Decisional DNA.",

abstract="The Internet of Things promises to connect different kinds of devices, allow for new ways of interaction, and make our lives easier. But, we need to be able to trust that the Internet of Things will protect our security and privacy. It should also be universally designed so that anyone can use it regardless of ability. We applied a user-centered approach to looking at user-centered trust in the Internet of Things, including universal design issues. We conducted an evaluation with 85 participants of a security assistant that can present security and privacy information to users. The evaluation included participants who were either elderly, had vision impairment, or had dsylexia. Participants found the information useful, but there was confusion about how the UI worked. We present an updated security assistant and future areas for research in trust and the Internet of Things.",

abstract="Generating source code from a software spec to automate software development is arguably one of the most challenging tasks due to, for example, the complexity of software domain, richness of user interface and the heterogeneity of development platforms. Domain-specific approaches make code generation technically possible by narrowing down the software domain. Internet of Things is a paradigm shift in computing that might eventually give rise to the proliferation of dedicated software methods and tools. Domain-specific software engineering in this new computing paradigm leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper, we propose an approach to semi-automatically generating C code out of a visual design for the software module controlling wearable devices. The visual design consists of (i) input panel describing components that receive input data and how they are wired to the module; (ii) output panel describing components that produce output data and how they are wired to the module; (iii) connectivity and data storage; and (iv) state machine of the module. We have tested our domain-specific framework in a case-study where wearable devices used for ordering (i.e., to serve restaurant's clients) and delivering (i.e., to assist restaurant's waiters) food at a restaurant need to be developed.",

The implementation of Industry 4.0 will significantly rely on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. IoT is poised to become the next big thing in the IT arena. However, the use of IoT technology to implement Industry 4.0 will require a collaborative efforts. There are many aspects that all stake holders both in IT world and Industry 4.0 will need to consider; these multiple aspects can be defined (i) smooth integration of the newly developed IoT sensors (things) into existing industries. (ii) Transparent secure communication channel and software layer to link manufacturing data with cloud based SW platforms. (iii) Developing a standard IoT architecture; Open standard is vital to guarantee hundreds of millions of Internet-connected things are inter-operable and being able to communicate with each other. (iv) Big Data storage and management capability. (v) Development of energy efficient IoT sensors and devices. The objective of this study is to explore the role IoT and related technologies such as cyber-physical systems (CPS) will play in the implementation of Industry 4.0. The paper begins with an introduction that gives an overview of IoT and Industry 4.0.

As shown by some recent incidents, like the Mirai and BrickerBot botnets, security is a key issue for current and future IoT systems. In this paper, we examine the security of different categories of IoT devices to understand their resilience under different security conditions for attackers. In particular, we analyse IoT robustness against attacks performed under two threat models, namely (i) physical access of the attacker, (ii) close proximity of the attacker (i.e., RFID and WiFi ranges). We discuss the results of the tests we performed on different categories of IoT devices, namely IP cameras, OFo bike locks, RFID-based smart-locks, and smart-home WiFi routers. The results show that most of IoT devices do not address basic vulnerabilities, which can be exploitable under different threat models.",

Now we can communicate with smart device, such as microwave oven, camera, and control it using App in our smart phone, but due to the poor computing power of smart device, it tends to be intractable to protect this communication from attack. By analyzing the security threats faced during the process of smart device and App authenticating each other's identity, this paper proposed a lightweight transfer protocol for smart device, and introduced ``Authentication Center'' to help with authentication for smart device and App. In consideration of poor computing power of smart device, the lightweight protocol achieves effective reduction of network resource usage. Acting as a hub, the Authentication Center does the heavy certification and authorization work as well as the management of smart device. This protocol can protect data confidentiality, data integrity against replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack by ensuring the identities of device and App with the help of Authentication Center.",

abstract="As the number of connected devices is exponentially growing, the IoT community is investigating potential ways of overcoming the resulting heterogeneity to enable device compatibility, interoperability and integration. The Semantic Web technologies, frequently used to address these issues, have been employed to develop a number of ontological frameworks, aiming to provide a common vocabulary of terms for the IoT domain. Defined in Web Ontology Language -- a language based on the Description Logics, and thus equipped with the `off-the-shelf' support for formal reasoning -- these ontologies, however, seem to neglect the built-in automated reasoning capabilities. Accordingly, this paper discusses the possibility of leveraging this idle potential for automated analysis in the context of defining and enforcing policies for the IoT. As a first step towards a proof of concept, the paper focuses on a simple use case and, using the existing IoT-Lite ontology, demonstrates different types of semantic classification to enable policy enforcement. As a result, it becomes possible to detect a critical situation, when a dangerous temperature threshold has been exceeded. With the proposed approach, IoT practitioners are offered an already existing, reliable and optimised policy enforcement mechanism. Moreover, they are also expected to benefit from support for policy governance, separation of concerns, a declarative approach to knowledge engineering, and an extensible architecture.",

We evaluated the performance of Trust-ABAC through an experiment based on a simulation. We used the OMNeT++ simulator to show the efficiency of our model in terms of power consumption, response time and the average number of messages generated by an access request.

Yet, such a large scaled environment needs a semantic background to achieve interoperability and knowledge diffusion. Furthermore, this open, distributed and heterogeneous environment raises important challenges, such as trustworthiness among the various types of devices and participants. Developing and sharing ontologies that support trust management models and applications would be an effective step in achieving semantic interoperability on a large scale. Currently, most of the ontologies and semantic description frameworks in the Internet of Things are either context-based or at an early stage. This paper reports on identifying and incorporating social and non-social parameters involved in the Internet of Things in a general-purpose ontology that will support trust management. This ontology will include among others data and semantics about trust principles, involved parties, characteristics of entities, rating parameters, rule-based mechanisms, confidence and dishonesty in the environment. Defining an ontology and using semantic descriptions for data related to trustworthiness issues will provide an important instrument in developing distributed trust (reputation) models.",

In such an environment, Wireless Sensor Networks play a crucial role, since they support different applications domains. Nevertheless, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a new ultra-lightweight authentication scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks in the context of IoT. This scheme allows both of the sensor and the user to authenticate each other in order to secure the communication. The proposed scheme uses only nonces, exclusive-or, concatenation operations to achieve mutual authentication. Moreover, it terminates with a session key agreement between the sensor node and the user. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that the proposed scheme provides authentication with low energy consumption, and ensures a resistance against different types of attacks.",

For that reason, this work describes a particular use case focused on the implementation of the solution for careful monitoring of blood bags, since this requires the communication with the items in order to control the temperature in the bags to detect that it has not been out of range, and control during the transport the temperature in the trailer in order to avoid that situation.

A tool supporting the new approach (GPE) was compared to Android Studio (AS                                                                                  {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\}}{\$}{\$}                  ), the industry standard for Android development. Our data analysis shows that GPE is more effective than AS                                                                                  {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   when performing certain tasks, with no measurable degrade in the quality of the produced GUIs.

These parameters could be measured using different electronics devices to keep up the health record and notify the individual and the doctor about any aberrations. Due to growing population and urbanization, various life style health problems are on the rise. Majority of the healthcare devices work in silos. Hence health vitals recorded remain locally stored and enhance the chances of data getting loss. By interconnecting these devices, we could maintain the health records centrally and derive insights. This could be incorporated with the advanced wireless technology. Smartphones could be leveraged for smart functionalities like voice recognition and Google services available.

In this paper, we propose a new lightweight architecture for the Web of Things, based on RESTful approaches. We further show, through a proof of concept application, taking a smart city as its context, how new technologies can be combined to support our proposed architecture and application development for the Web of Things.

Information from health IoT devices and services is sensitive and confidential. While many existing works have proposed enhancements and security prospects for individual devices and components in IoT ecosystems, they still do not address the underlying challenge which is the lack of sufficient security within systems. Effective security has to be built-in, not patched upon. To efficaciously tackle the challenge in distributed IoT systems, we present a security context framework which applies adaptive security contexts to properly track data of interest. The proposed solution can achieve accountability and track information propagation, involving devices, services and parties who have responsibility and potential legal liability. This could help leverage not just technical but also policy and legal aspects to enable health IoT adoption.",

abstract="The increasing percentage of elderly people in the population (at least in Europe and North America) is part of a demographic change that will have an enormous impact on the society in the next few years. Thus, intelligent solutions that rely on the Internet of Things have been proposed in the literature, with the final goal to give remote support to elderly people at their home. Those solutions aim at monitoring activities and behaviors, and automatically send alarms in case of anomalies, putting in contact the end-user with her/his GP or alerting the emergency center or familiars, according to the specific needs. However, although the great deal of worldwide researches in the area of the Internet of Things and its early applications to healthcare and teleassistance, the technologies to apply it in real-world with the necessary dependability levels are far from being assessed. In this paper, we propose novel software engineering concepts that, by synthesizing existing proposals bringing in the lessons of agent-based computing and agent-oriented software engineering, can effectively support the systematic (and thus more dependable) development of Internet of Things applications.",

About 70{\%} of the earth's surface is covered with water out of which only 1{\%} is available as fresh water. In that case there is a need to use water efficiently. A vast amount of water is being wasted without being consumed anywhere due to existing ineffective water supply system. Unnecessary leakage of large amount of water during supply, unsystematic supply to various regions i.e. not according to consumption, need or requirement, degraded water quality, time taking process to find the fault and then fixing it are the major drawbacks in the existing supply system.

abstract="The high cost of healthcare services, the aging population and the increase of chronic disease are becoming a global concern. Several studies have indicated the need for strategies to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. A promising trend in healthcare is to move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric). Moreover, recent advances in microelectronics, wireless, sensing and information have boosted the advent of a revolutionary model involving systems and communication technology, enabling smarter ways to ``make things happen''. This new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has a broad applicability in several areas, including healthcare. The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of this technology-based healthcare approach, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve the wellness of the patients, as well as a better application of government financial resources. Based on this context, this paper aims to describe a review to comprehend the current state and future trends for healthcare applications based on IoT infrastructure, and also to find areas for further investigations.",

abstract="This paper attempts to project a novel concept where medical sensors, cloud computing and robotic platform are unified to offer state-of-the-art healthcare solutions to a wide variety of scenarios. The proposed solution is most effective if there is scarcity of healthcare providers or if putting them in the field expose them into a high risk environment such as fighting epidemics. In addition, the proposed system will also benefit routine checks in quarantine wards of hospitals where human reluctance of performing routine task by the healthcare providers can be avoided. Finally, it can also assist a doctor as a decision support system by using machine's capability of number crunching while it examines through patient's complete history, goes through every medical test reports and then applies data mining for catching possible ailments from his/her symptoms.",

abstract="Early Warning Score (EWS) system is specified to detect and predict patient deterioration in hospitals. This is achievable via monitoring patient's vital signs continuously and is often manually done with paper and pen. However, because of the constraints in healthcare resources and the high hospital costs, the patient might not be hospitalized for the whole period of the treatments, which has lead to a demand for in-home or portable EWS systems. Such a personalized EWS system needs to monitor the patient at anytime and anywhere even when the patient is carrying out daily activities. In this paper, we propose a self-aware EWS system which is the reinforced version of the existing EWS systems by using the Internet of Things technologies and the self-awareness concept. Our self-aware approach provides (i) system adaptivity with respect to various situations and (ii) system personalization by paying attention to critical parameters. We evaluate the proposed EWS system using a full system demonstration.",

abstract="There is a global concern with the increasing number of patients at hospitals caused by population ageing and chronic diseases. Several studies indicated the need to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. In this context, a promising trend in healthcare is to move medical checks routines from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric), but to make it possible we need Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies and platforms to enable remote health monitoring. The application of IoT in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of IoT-based healthcare applications, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve patients' wellness, as well as a better application of the government's financial resources. Thus, based on this context, this paper aims to propose an IoT-based healthcare platform for the remote monitoring of patients in critical condition. It involves embedding sensors and actuators in patients, physicians, clinical staff, medical equipment and physical spaces in order to monitor, track and alert.",

abstract="The healthcare sector faces important challenges in evaluating and improving its services to meet desired targets, patient needs, and government requirements. In particular, the introduction of a new process or information system in healthcare is a challenging task, especially in the absence of mature practices for requirements engineering and process modeling. Most of today's healthcare process research is focused on mappings between existing processes and new ones without considering the different needs of multiple stakeholders and the satisfaction of organizational goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) approach that highlights integration opportunities of each new activity into current processes. AbPI exploits the User Requirements Notation (URN) language to model, analyze, and estimate the potential impact of each integration opportunity on performance objectives, organizational goals, and stakeholder satisfaction. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach with an illustrative example (increasing patient satisfaction in an Emergency Room). Preliminary results show the feasibility of the approach as well as many potential benefits over existing approaches.",

abstract="The design and development of wearable biosensor systems for health monitoring has garnered lots of attention in the scientific community and the industry during the last years. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables added value services by connecting smart objects in a secure way in different applications, such as transport, health, building, energy, ecology, or industry, through multiscale integration. This paper presents a preliminary study on the design of a smart sock for dia-betic patients. This smart sock will allow monitoring diabetic patient's health condition and temperature levels using foot temperature sensors. Sensed vital signs will be transmitted to a dedicated transmitter/receiver pair, such as a PC, PDA, or a mobile phone. It would make possible for patients to have real time information about their health condition, including foot temperature levels and therefore managing their diet and/or medication. As the market's demand for medical information increases, this smart sock will provide a significant part of the answer for patients.",

abstract="This paper presents our work in progress on enabling computerized reasoning capability in machine-to-machine communication scenarios for the Networked Society (or Internet of Things). Such reasoning capability is about drawing high-level conclusions on the situation in real time based on raw data streams generated by various sources. There are challenges posed by the dynamic and heterogenous availability of raw data coming from different sources, as well as the stringent time constraints for conclusions to be made. Our goal hence is to make machine-based reasoning processes time-efficient, resource-efficient, and scalable. We present an approach that addresses the challenges by decomposing a reasoning process into two stages: ``shallow reasoning'' and ``deep reasoning''. The former deals with the dynamic and heterogenous availability of raw data from different sources, while the latter executes semantic reasoning with a lightweight workload that has been reduced by the former. We present our prototype implementation of a reasoning system that adopts the proposed approach in a proactive healthcare use case. Performance evaluation is currently ongoing to verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

It is a platform of information distribution that focus on the status of patients' health and is meant to be easily accessed by health care professionals. It also supports the automatic collection of vital patient data by using Arduino microcontrollers, medical sensors and wearables. In addition, it performs an automatic detection process of anomalies in a patient's condition in real time and sends alerts to the health care providers in charge, through the use of software agents.

abstract="The evolved vision of the Internet-of-Things predicts tremendous growth in the number of connected human-unattended objects over the following years. However, existing wireless network protocols were not originally designed for such excessive numbers of nodes. Therefore, currently deployed networking solutions are not optimized for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. To bridge in this gap, IEEE 802.16m cellular technology targets extensive improvements to support M2M communications. As such, performance assessment of an 802.16m-based network with respect to the expected M2M scenarios is topical. In particular, the contention-based procedure for network admission control is very likely to become a bottleneck for the entire system. Therefore, we focus performance assessment of the standardized collision resolution algorithm, used in the random access channel, with respect to M2M. In particular, this paper addresses a Smart Grid use case, where a large number of devices access the network within a relatively short period of time. We discuss specific performance requirements that apply to the considered scenario. Then, an evaluation methodology to investigate the adaptability of the 802.16m system is presented. Finally, we conclude on the capability of the 802.16m technology to support an excessive number of human-unattended devices.",

abstract="Having the right product at the right time at the right place and in the right condition -- these are the well-known requirements for logistics and transportation in general. But fulfilling these requirements is getting more and more complex in a dynamically changing logistic environment. There is a shift from traditional supply chains to open supply networks. Long-lasting business relationships are overrun by short-term business connections. The highly dynamic logistic markets and the advancing complexity of logistic networks require new methods, products and services. Aspects such as flexibility, adaptability and proactivity gain importance and can only be achieved by integration of new technologies. While problem initiated approaches usually only lead to minor improvements, technology driven approaches can evoke more radical changes. The technology driven approach that is used to define Smart Products and Smart Services is utilized and extended to define ``Smart Logistics''. Within the paper a definition of Smart Logistics is given. Additionally current technical components of Smart Logistics are specified.",

The new idea of the bathroom is shaped within the context of a changing population profile, which is impacting on the number of people requiring health care. The demands on health-friendly aspects in the bathroom environment are increasing along with health awareness and increasing interest for wellbeing. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a bathroom of various purposes and different characteristics. The integration of smart home technology to support health of users turns out to be necessary to achieve this goal. The purpose of this study is to present the bathroom as a place for healthcare by applying intelligent technology systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, in a bathroom space. For this reason, it is necessary to define the concept of intelligent bathroom and to demonstrate its potential for smart technology. An important issue in the study is the recognition of the current needs of users in terms of health and well-being manifested in the interest in using IoT technology in the bathroom space.",

abstract="The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) over the past few years enabled a lot of application domains. Due to the increasing number of IoT connected devices, the amount of generated data is increasing too. Processing huge amounts of data is complex due to the continuously running situation recognition algorithms. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an approach for optimizing the usage of situation recognition algorithms in Internet of Things domains. The key idea of our approach is to select important data, based on situation recognition purposes, and to execute the situation recognition algorithms after all relevant data have been collected. The main advantage of our approach is that situation recognition algorithms will not be executed each time new data is received, thus allowing the reduction of the situation recognition algorithms execution frequency and saving computational resources.",

AAL systems equipped with IoT devices will generate vast amount of data in short time, thus a big data problem to mangle. This study proposes a simulation infrastructure that allows researchers to create their own AAL scenarios without real devices, and a system architecture to tackle the big data problem that is inferred by utilization of IoT in AAL systems. In order to understand feasibility of the architecture we conduct a performance experiment, in which we increase the number of messages that the system can handle per second.

The network architecture uses a WiFi ad-hoc mode that enables the IoT devices to authenticate among themselves during the initial network formation. The IoT devices are only allowed to join an autonomous IoT network if the devices are running the users' pre-agreed application(s), in the list of permitted devices, and have an unique identification.

Almost all of these errors are unintentional and come from incorrect prescriptions, unsuitable dosages for the patient or incompatibility with other treatments. To limit these risks which are especially important in the elderly or pre-dependency, we propose a secure system for drug treatment through the NFC (Near Field Communication) contact-less communication technology. The proposed system provides security mechanisms such as integrity, authentication, encryption and non-repudiation. To ensure this security, an extension of the international standard ISO/IED 13157 (NFC-SEC) is proposed to handle electronic signature based on a public key infrastructure.",

abstract="Due to protocols such as 6LoWPAN and CoAP, wireless sensor nodes have become an integral part of the Internet. While this makes their data available on the Internet, it still remains a strictly devicecentric approach. However, one is usually interested in the phenomena observed by one or more devices and not in the sensors themselves. To bridge this gap, we introduce and evaluate the concept of Service-Level Semantic Entities (SLSE). They support the automatic semantic annotation of real-world objects based on networked sensor devices. SLSE continuously collect observations of sensors attached to some objects, and aggregates them to descriptions of the objects themselves. It then makes this augmented object data available as (semantic) linked data. This removes several layers of indirection in the semantic data, and allows to directly access properties of real-world objects.",

However selecting the most trusted service provider among available ones is a challenging task. In this paper, we have proposed a new model for pervasive health-care systems in which the patient smart device not only uses its own past experiences but also learns from its neighbors (friends) in a health-care social network to update the trust of available providers using a CLA (cellular learning automata). Comparing the proposed method with existing recommendation based methods shows that it is more scalable, efficient and appropriate for dynamic environments without sacrificing the precision.",

The proposed MPTC will then update in real-time the consultation planning in order to statistically minimize (i) the number of critical patients not treated within a pre-defined waiting time, (ii) the number of patients waiting for more than a pre-defined period and (iii) the number of patients living relatively far who gets their consultation postponed to another day.",

abstract="Healthcare using Mobile devices and Cloud Computing is an emergent topic of interest in both industry and research. Though ubiquity of mobile devices and availability of e-Health record plays an important role to enhance health care quality and services, it introduces several challenges too such as, limited power of mobile devices, privacy and anonymity of patient data, the reliability of end user, interoperability and availability of e-Health records, etc. Under HIPAA regulations, healthcare data needs to be secured from unsolicited disclosure when sharing among multiple medical service providers. In this paper, we focus on exchanging healthcare data among doctor and patient's healthcare service providers. We develop an android mobile application and a Cloud service to exchange patient's data among authorized users in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The cloud service that we developed performs cryptographic computations, communicates with mobile application and also overcomes the limitations of mobile devices. We evaluate our proposed solution using real-world data set. The performance analysis proves the efficiency of our application. Privacy analysis of our proposed solution depicts that our system is secure and protects the privacy of healthcare data.",

abstract="Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of ``D2B'' time, which is defined as the time interval between an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patient arrives at hospital and he/she receives primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient's Electrocardiogram (ECG) must be confirmed by a cardiologist and made sure the patient really has AMI. For the confirmation, the cardiologists must access a PC, connect it to the intranet of the hospital and employ the special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can diagnose the ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since PC, the browser and/or network may be currently unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a system with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG after receiving the short message service (SMS) text issued by his/her hospital so as to avoid the mentioned problem and shorten the D2B time.",

abstract="In recent years, Data Mining techniques such as classification, clustering, association, regression etc. are widely used in healthcare field to help analyzing and predicting disease and improving the quality and efficiency of medical services. This paper presents a web-based platform for big data analysis of healthcare using Data Mining techniques. The platform consists of three main layers: Apache Spark Layer, Workflow Layer and Web Service Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Apache Spark functionalities as regular Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) operations. Meanwhile, this layer provides a cache mechanism to maximize the use of the results as much as possible which were calculated before. Workflow Layer encapsulates a variety of nodes for Data Mining, which have different roles such as data source, algorithm model or evaluation tool. These nodes can be organized into a workflow which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then it will be submitted to Apache Spark Layer to execute. And we have implemented many models including Na{\"i}ve Bayes model, Decision Tree model and Logistic Regression model etc. for healthcare big data. Web Service Layer implements rich restful API including data uploading, workflow composition and analysis task submission. We also provide a web graphical interface for the user. Through the interface users can achieve efficient Data Mining without any programming which can greatly help the medical staff who don't understand programming to diagnose the patients' condition more accurately and efficiently.",

This is achieved through the use of a global log data abstraction that leverages the storage and processing capabilities of the edge devices and the cloud in a seamless manner. In existing log based storage systems, data is read as fixed size chunks from the cloud to enhance performance. However, in healthcare applications, where the data access pattern of the end users differ widely, this approach leads to unnecessary storage and cost overheads. To overcome these, we propose dynamic log chunking. The experimental results, comparing existing fixed chunking against the H-Plane model, show 13 {\%}--19 {\%} savings in network bandwidth as well as cost while fetching the data from the cloud.",

Through an instantiation of the refactored middleware in a home network to deliver a health monitoring service the benefits are demonstrated; the benefits regard the digital representation of the physical realm, deployment and maintenance of services, and management of devices and networks.",

abstract="A virtual patient navigator is a web/mobile application that helps patients with lung cancer diagnosis reduce their anxiety and uncertainties. In particular, lung cancer patients easily become overwhelmed when having to manage information overload, many appointments with different instructions and locations, and recommendations on how to improve their lifestyle. Existing solutions such as paper-based patient navigators provide much reliable information but are limited in terms of dynamic updates and do not provide opportunities for interactions between care providers and patients. In this paper, we propose a new web-based, mobile, and user-friendly virtual patient navigator application named Care Ami, which incorporates the information found in an existing paper-based navigator along with new features such as remote updates to personal care paths and calendars, personalized navigation guidance, sharing of symptom/medication information, and peer group support. The architecture and main features of this application are presented. Based on the identified requirements, Care Ami compares favorably against related work and solutions.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) enables Smart Cities with novel services. Waste collection in Smart Cities becomes a dynamic process with the proliferation of sensors and actuators embedded on real waste bins. Heterogeneous fleets of trucks are used for efficient waste collection exploiting the diverse road network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by incorporating Low Capacity Trucks (LCTs) and High Capacity Trucks (HCTs). However, HCTs are serving as Mobile Depots (MDs) which are cost efficient and decongest traffic in Smart Cities. A detailed system overview illustrates the architecture of the proposed approach. We also propose novel algorithms which support dynamic waste collection with MDs. Scheduling and routing are transformed to dynamic models. Specifically, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm while we customize an existing routing algorithm. The models where experimentally evaluated with real and synthetic data from the city of St. Petersburg, Russia. The results were promising and proved that the incorporation of MDs is efficient for waste collection in IoT-enabled Smart Cities. Finally, we perform an economic analysis in order to define the economic impact of the proposed solution to the municipality budget for an ownership cost for a period of five years; in which the proposed solution proved to be cost efficient.",

The Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) setting is the typical communication scenario to carry out the data in this case. From a user perspective, combining vehicular networking and eHealth to record and transmit a patient's vital signs is a special telemedicine application that helps hospital resident professionals to optimally prepare the patient's admittance. The current proposal pro-vides an IPv6 vehicular platform which integrates eHealth devices and allows sending captured user health-related data to a Personal Health Record (PHR) application server on the IPv6 Internet.

Earlier, in these applications, the primary issue is handling efficient communication among the interconnected devices to have an extended network lifetime. Nowadays, as data grows rapidly in the IoT, security and privacy is also a major issue to be concentrated in these applications to reduce vulnerabilities. Recent studies show that the existing IP security protocols and algorithm have technical limitation in applying it to the context Internet of Things. In particular, when a new device enters to an existing secured network, the network should ensure that the new device is authenticated and authorized properly with respect to the properties of existing network. Otherwise, similar to other network, IoT network also will be subjected to various attacks such as physical attacks, service disruption attacks, data attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. Hence, in this work, an algorithm to authenticate and authorize when a new device gets added to the existing network is proposed. The algorithm is tested for various attacks and the results are proven to be efficient and secure.",

abstract="Low-end embedded devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly important for our lives. They are being used in domains such as infrastructure management, and medical and healthcare systems, where business interests and our security and privacy are at stake. Yet, security mechanisms have been appallingly neglected on many IoT platforms. In this paper we present a secure access control mechanism for extremely lightweight embedded microcontrollers. Being based on Sancus, a hardware-only Trusted Computing Base and Protected Module Architecture for the embedded domain, our mechanism allows for multiple software modules on an IoT-node to securely share resources. We implement and evaluate our approach for two application scenarios, a shared memory system and a shared flash drive. Our implementation is based on a Sancus-enabled TI MSP430 microcontroller. We show that our mechanism can give high security guarantees at small runtime overheads and a moderately increased size of the Trusted Computing Base.",

abstract="Cloud-based Engineering Systems offer new possibilities to leverage the emerging ``network effect'', by relying on the access to large pools of computational resources that are available in the ``cloud'' to overcome the limitations of environments with scarce processing and information storage capability. The impact of this approach is already observed in most engineering domains. Motivating engineering doctoral students to look into the potential of this novel research area is essential for their education. With this aim, the doctoral conference DoCEIS'15 focused on technological innovation for Cloud-based Engineering Systems, challenging the contributors to analyze in which ways their technical and scientific work could contribute to or benefit from this paradigm. The results of this initiative are briefly analyzed in this chapter.",

abstract="Stroke is one of the major problems in medical and healthcare that can cause severe disability and death of patients especially for older population. Rehabilitation plays an important role in stroke therapy. However, most of the rehabilitative exercises are monotonous and tiring for the patients. For a particular time, they can easily get bored in doing these exercises. The role of patient's motivation in rehabilitation is vital. Motivation and rehabilitative outcomes are strongly related. Digital games are promising to help stroke patients to feel motivated and more engaged in rehabilitative training through motivational gameplay. Most of the commercial games available in the market are not well-designed for stroke patients and their motivational needs in rehabilitation. This study aims at understanding the motivational requirements of stroke patients in doing rehabilitative exercises and living in a post-stroke life. Based on the findings from the literature review, we report that there are many factors that can influence the stroke patients' level of motivation such as social functioning, patient-therapist relationship, goal-setting, and music. These findings are insightful and useful for ideating and designing interactive motivation-driven games for stroke patients. The motivational factors of stroke patients in rehabilitation may help the game designers to design motivation-driven game contexts, contents, and gameplay. Moreover, these findings may help not only game designers but also healthcare professionals who concern stroke patient's motivation in rehabilitative context.",

abstract="The ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) has come to describe a new paradigm that enables the Internet to reach out into the real world of physical objects. Technologies like RFID, short-range wireless communication, real-time localization and sensor networks are becoming increasingly common and turning IoT into reality. It is expected to grow rapidly into a huge new market domain that may lead to disruptive changes in areas such as logistics, energy management and healthcare. Mobile and collaborative applications and services utilizing information processing and process support enabled by sensor data from a vast numbers of connected and cheap devices will change many markets when being made more easily available. New event-driven architectures (EDA) providing varied information to support collaborative decision-making enable more decisions to be made closer to the problem owner. The expected impacts of the combination of IoT and EDA on business and society are formidable. It also opens the possibility to take into account additional input from users to ensure shorter turnaround from ideas to new, personalized information systems support. Future business information systems will need to take this situation into account, addressing technological, methodological and conceptual challenges. This paper will focus on the latter, discussing in particular the potential role of model-based techniques and how to assess and improve the quality of models and modeling approaches in this setting.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions and services may be used to support and extend the independent living of older adults in their living environments by responding to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities. Telemedicine and telehealth platforms are among the various types of IoT services that could support the provision of health services. Current Health Technology Assessment (HTA) models that are used for the evaluation of telehealth and telemedicine services do not consider IoT aspects. HTA models would ideally need to be extended to include IoT platforms, for an optimal introduction of IoT in everyday provision of health and care services. This paper presents an initial adaptation of the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST) for IoT Telemedicine services based on a literature review of IoT, telemedicine and telehealth services characteristics. MAST involves assessment of outcomes within the following seven domains: Health problem and characteristics of the application, Safety, Clinical effectiveness, Patient perspectives, Economic aspects, Organizational aspects, Socio-cultural, ethical and legal aspects. The domains of the characteristics of the application, socio-cultural, safety and ethical and legal aspects were identified as those to be adapted to cover new challenges associated to IoT services.",

There are a lot of raw medical data available to healthcare organizations in the form of structured and unstructured datasets, but the need is to analyze this data to get information and to make intelligent decisions. By using data mining, classification tool on a real dataset of cardiac patients we propose a model which classified these patients into four major classes. This model will help to identify the risk of HF and patients who have no HF signs but structural irregularities. We can also identify the patients having HF signs and irregularities and those having the critical stage of HF.

Lot of existing research has focused on sensing user mood classification based on device data but there is limited research that has focused to diagnose and heal depression. A conventional method of doctors detecting depression is based on Hamilton scale of depression with a set of questions and is an intrusive method to probe depression patients. IoT devices are slowly gaining popularity and huge data that is generated from these devices can be leveraged to determine user emotional health. Proposed method attempts to analyze IoT device data and calculate user depression scale and recommends relevant social communication with user social contacts (Friends, Family Members). Identifying precise social contacts and recommending actions and content to recover from early stages of depression is one of the goals of the proposed system. Method recommends relevant social contacts based on current depression score. Proposed system tries to monitor user's emotional state and more tries to act as preventive health assistant to correct emotional states in early stages and avoids user moving to advanced stages of depression.",

As such there is a great demand for technologies that support the independent and safe living of the elderly and ensuring that they are not socially isolated. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have thus emerged to support the elderly people in their daily activities, while removing the need of caregivers being always physically present in order to look after the elderly. The current AAL systems are intelligent enough to take critical decisions in emergency situations like a fall, fire or a cardiac arrest, hence the elderly can live safely and independently.

abstract="Ambient-assisted living (AAL) is an initiative to extend the time the elderly can live in their home environment by increasing their autonomy and assisting them carry out their daily activities. AAL systems exploit information and communication technologies (ICT) in the assistance to carry out daily activities, health and activity monitoring, enhancing safety and security and getting access to social, medical and emergency systems. These ICTs are in the form of smart systems, which are physical objects that are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, enabling them not only to intercommunicate with one another, but also to exchange information with people and react to their environment. This paper is on a low-cost technology customised to the South African environment to support ambient assisted living. The technology takes advantage of South Africa's digitalisation programme to provide broadband access in the support of AAL. Digital television as a gateway to internet access, wireless mesh networks for communication, motes for machine to machine communication and smart phones are the technologies supported in this architecture. A survey of AAL technologies was conducted and features of these systems that would be useful in defining our architecture identified. These features contribute to the development of an architecture for AAL. This research feeds into extending the body of knowledge on AAL technologies.",

Cloud computing can provide a powerful, scalable storage and the massive data processing infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis and mining of the heterogeneous sensor data streams. In order to support high-volume and real-time sensor data streams processing, in this paper, we propose a massive sensor data streams multi-dimensional analysis strategy using progressive logarithmic tilted time frame for cloud based monitoring application. The proposed strategy is sufficient for many high-dimensional streams analysis tasks using map-reduce platform of cloud computing. Finally, the simulation results show that proposed strategy achieves the enhancing storage performance and also can ensures that the total amount of data to retain in memory or to be stored on disk is small for achieving the performance improvement of the massive sensor data streams analysis.",

WSN grows in rapid pace as it emerges as one of the most important technological developments. Since its emergence, the wireless sensor network (WSN) constitutes one of the most important technological developments in the last decade. It has the potential to affect our lifestyle deeply. However, its success relies greatly on a well-defined architecture that will provide scalable, dynamic, and secure basement to its deployment. The IoT-based architectures are intelligent applications that make energy, logistics, industrial control, retail, agriculture, and many other domains ``smarter.'' With emergence of wireless sensor network as Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet, that is, rapidly gathering momentum driven by the advancements in sensor networks, mobile devices, wireless communications, and networking and cloud technologies. With rapidly increasing wireless sensor network (WSN)- and internet of thing (IoT)-based services; a lot of data is generated. It is becoming very difficult to manage power constrained small sensors and other data-generating devices. WSN or IoTs enables anything can become part of the Internet and generate data. Moreover, data generation needs to be managed according to its requirements, to create more valuable services. For this purpose, integration of WSN or IoTs with cloud computing is becoming very important. The small IoT sensors deployed in agricultural fields measuring the vast amount of information using sensors like air pressure, environmental temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, soil moisture, soil temperature, wind speed, leaf wetness, CO concentration and N, P, and K concentration.

abstract="Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), an advancing technology in the field of pervasive healthcare monitor patients ubiquitously and provide real-time feedback. Data communication consumes more energy than data processing in WBANs. As it is nearly impractical to replace or recharge the dead sensor nodes, it has become a major concern to overcome issues related to data communication in WBANs that affect network lifetime and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for cluster head selection using genetic heuristics for enhancing network lifetime and harnessing energy consumption of the sensor nodes. It uses genetic heuristics and divides the network into clusters. A cluster head is chosen for inter and intra-cluster communication. Clustering is a feasible solution as it reduces the number of direct transmissions from source to sink. It enhances network lifetime and reduces energy consumption as there is inverse relationship between the two, i.e, less the energy consumption more is the network lifetime. The proposed algorithm is also analyzed mathematically in terms of time complexity, overhead and fault tolerance which reveals that our algorithm outperforms the existing techniques such as AnyBody and HIT in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime.",

Therefore, D2D is expected to be a vital technical component in Internet of Things (IoT) and play an important role with the next generation 5G. Moreover, the rapid growth in mobile capabilities opens the door to the cyber criminals that explore new avenues for malware attacks. Although the literature is proposed security schemes for malware attacks. However, the research field is still immature and unexplored in depth due to the fast evolution of malware at a rate far exceeding the evolution of security techniques. In this paper, the problem of detecting malware attacks is considered in D2D network and a secure energy-efficient routing protocol is proposed. The protocol aims at detecting malware attached to message before it infects the targeted device through optimal secure energy-efficient routes. Moreover, the protocol takes into account the attacker's behavior, computation of players' strategies including different attack cases and consideration of the dynamic scheme in terms of calculating malware detection capabilities and malware types due to the fast evolution of the malware. Through simulations, the proposed routing protocol is evaluated in terms of the detecting rate of the malicious messages and overall expected payoff of the defender compared with other non-strategic routing protocols. Results show that the game achieves Nash equilibrium, and leads to an optimal defense strategy for the network.",

Therefore, it has to be investigated how much delay can be tolerated for signal processing before the users perceive a delay when using a computer input device. This paper is aimed to find out a threshold of unperceived delay by performing user tests with 25 participants. A communication retarder was used to create delays from 0 to 100 ms between a receiving computer and three different USB-connected computer input devices. A wired mouse, a wifi mouse and a head-mounted mouse were used as input devices. The results of the user tests show that delays up to 50 ms could be tolerated and are not perceived as delay, or depending on the used device still perceived as acceptable.",

Therefore, in this work, we mainly focus on how emerging transistors such as tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) can be an alternative beyond-CMOS features for biosensor design and to further increase the low power design strategy to enable it for IoT applications. For this purpose, a charge plasma based dielectrically modulated TFET is proposed in this work, where source region is having SiGe material (with Si and Ge composition equal to 0.5) to improve the ON-state current. The charge plasma concept is employed to make the fabrication process simpler and to avoid the random dopant fluctuations (RDFs) and higher thermal budget. The significant improvement in the sensitivity of the proposed dielectrically modulated junctionless (DMJL) TFET biosensor with different dielectric constant and charge density, and a comparison with conventional MOSFET-based sensor enables its potential application for the Health-IoT applications.",

Integration and processing of these data streams is challenging. Semantic Web technologies are able to deal with the variety of data but are not able to deal with the velocity of the data. An emerging research domain, called stream reasoning, tries to bridge the gap between traditional stream processing and semantic reasoning. Research in the past years has resulted in several prototyped RDF Stream Processors, each of them with its own features and application domain. They all cover querying over RDF streams but lack support for complex reasoning. This paper presents how adaptive stream processing and context-awareness can be used to enhance semantic reasoning over streaming data. The result is a federated context-aware architecture that allows to leverage reasoning capabilities on data streams produced by distributed sensor devices.

We present a user study (n = 64) of an Exergame for AAL environments with the research foci performance and acceptance. Age is the predominant factor for performance, while the intention to use is determined by gaming frequency. Neither technical self-efficacy nor age had considerable influence on these measures.

abstract="The Childhood protection is a subject with high value for the society, but, the Child Abuse cases are difficult to identify. The process from suspicious to accusation is very difficult to achieve. It must configure very strong evidences. Typically, Health Care services deal with these cases from the beginning where there are evidences based on the diagnosis, but they aren't enough to promote the accusation. Besides that, this subject it's highly sensitive because there are legal aspects to deal with such as: the patient privacy, paternity issues, medical confidentiality, among others. We propose a Child Abuses critical knowledge monitor system model that addresses this problem. This decision support system is implemented with a multiple scientific domains: to capture of tokens from clinical documents from multiple sources; a topic model approach to identify the topics of the documents; knowledge management through the use of ontologies to support the critical knowledge sensibility concepts and relations such as: symptoms, behaviors, among other evidences in order to match with the topics inferred from the clinical documents and then alert and log when clinical evidences are present. Based on these alerts clinical personnel could analyze the situation and take the appropriate procedures.",

abstract="Hosting large-scale events is the dream of many cities around the world, however challenging. Hosting a large-scale event is a complex project that requires careful planning, precise implementation, interactive operation, and successful closure of all activities, with the involvement of all relevant organizations, authorities and stakeholders. Therefore, event organizers pay their utmost attention to the improvement of every aspect of Event Management. Application of smart city concepts can address the complexity of service provisioning during large-scale events, through better efficiency, higher quality, and real-time decision-making capabilities. Lifecycle management concepts can improve the whole event management cycle across different phases. This paper proposes combining Smart City and Lifecycle concepts to improve vertical service provisioning and horizontal integration between different sectors, across different phases while creating a suitable platform for information and knowledge sharing within the same event and with other similar events. This research aims to reach a more holistic smart event experience.",

Bearing in mind this idea, we have developed a low-cost ad hoc protocol based on Bluetooth technology that allows us to control all our home appliances and monitor the power consumption of our homes. Our proposal is based on an Android application installed on a mobile device which acts as server. The application allows users to program the various appliances. It is also able to check the status of the appliance, as well as controlling the power consumption of the house and its cost. The system is equipped with a smart algorithm able to manage all appliances and decide which ones should work as a function of various criteria such as time of day or power consumption. Finally, the system is able to detect faults in water and electricity supply for acting accordingly. All data received and sent by the server are stored in a database which the system can check and compare to make their own decisions.",

abstract="This paper presents a case-based classification system for alcohol detection using physiological parameters. Here, four physiological parameters e.g. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Respiration Rate (RR), Finger Temperature (FT), and Skin Conductance (SC) are used in a Case-based reasoning (CBR) system to detect alcoholic state. In this study, the participants are classified into two groups as drunk or sober. The experimental work shows that using the CBR classification approach the obtained accuracy for individual physiological parameters e.g., HRV is 85{\%}, RR is 81{\%}, FT is 95{\%} and SC is 86{\%}. On the other hand, the achieved accuracy is 88{\%} while combining the four parameters i.e., HRV, RR, FT and SC using the CBR system. So, the evaluation illustrates that the CBR system based on physiological sensor signal can classify alcohol state accurately when a person is under influence of at least 0.2 g/l of alcohol.",

The key point of our approach is in combining electronic properties of a molecular organic semiconductor with clothing. A polycarbonate film covered with organic molecular semiconductor was used as the temperature measurement element. To minimize the electrical response of the developed bi layer thermistor to deformations, the thermistor was attached to a rigid film-like platform specifically fabricated in the textile by its local melting. Our study shows that the developed platform enables engineering of the conductive fabric the electrical resistance of which exclusively responded to temperature changes. Such e-textiles may be easily prepared using a simple fabrication procedure and, therefore, they are compatible with conductive sensing fabrics prepared by printing techniques. The developed organic thermistor, being cheap, lightweight and biocompatible, is highly attractive for applications in wearable biomedical technology.",

However, due to open nature of wireless channel and limited computing and storage resource of sensor node, how to guarantee the sensitive sensed data are only be accessed by valid user becomes an important issue. Many user authentication protocols for WSNs have been proposed to address this issue, however, previous work more or less have their own weaknesses. Recently, Gope and Hwang proposed a lightweight anonymity authentication for WSNs, and they claimed that their protocol is secure against most attacks. However, our analysis indicates that their protocol still has some design and security flaws. To address the security issue for WSNs, a user authentication protocol with privacy protection for WSNs has been proposed. The analysis and comparisons results show that the proposed protocol is a robust and security one for WSNs.",

Therefore, the combination of WSN and Socially Aware Computing holds great promise and challenge to use the sensory data to understand human behavior, human mobility, and ultimately to help solve human social problems.

A summary of this review's finding is represented in a table including devices (sensors), measures and methods that were used in each reviewed motor symptom assessment study. In the gathered studies among sensors, accelerometers and touch screen devices are the most widely used to detect PD symptoms and among symptoms, bradykinesia and tremor were found to be mostly evaluated. In general, machine learning methods are potentially promising for this. PD is a complex disease that requires continuous monitoring and multidimensional symptom analysis.

The key functionality of Trauma Tracker is to keep track of relevant events occurring during the management of a trauma, for different purposes. The basic one -- discussed in detail in this paper -- is to have an accurate documentation of the trauma, to automate the creation (and management) of reports and to enable offline data analysis, useful for performance evaluation and to improve the work of the Trauma Team. Then, tracking is essential to conceive more involved assisting functionalities by the PMDA, from monitoring and warning generation to suggesting actions to perform---fully exploiting the hands-free interface of wearable technologies.

If you want to get something you can't produce yourself, you either produce something and trade it, or you go out with your friends with pointy sticks or with ballot boxes and take it some other way. Game theory gives us at least the beginnings of a framework for understanding how people make these choices.",

abstract="This study determined the intra-rater and test-retest reliability of a novel motion-tracking system that integrates inertial sensors with Microsoft Kinect to measure peak shoulder range-of-motion (ROM) angles. Nine healthy individuals (6 female and 3 male, age: 36.6 {\textpm} 13.3) with no shoulder pathology participated following ethical approval. Participants performed active shoulder forward flexion and abduction to the end of available range. Repeat testing of the protocol was completed after 7 days by the same rater. Results demonstrated excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC = 0.84, 0.93) for shoulder flexion and modest-excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC = 0.82, 0.52) for shoulder abduction. A high level of correlation was observed between week 1 and 2 for flexion and abduction (R = 0.85 -- 0.93), expect for left abduction (R = 0.60). In conclusion, an inertial system combined with the Kinect is a reliable tool to measure shoulder ROM and has the potential for future research and clinical application.",

abstract="Transportation systems are complex with respect to technology and operations with involvement in a wide range of human actors, organisations and technical solutions. For the operations and control of such complex environments, a viable solution is to apply intelligent computerised systems, such as computerised traffic control systems for coordinating airline transportation, or advanced monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles. Moreover, transportation assets cannot compromise the safety of the passengers by applying operation and maintenance activities. Indeed safety becomes a more difficult goal to achieve using traditional maintenance strategies and computerised solutions come into the picture as the only option to deal with complex systems interacting among them trying to balance the growth in technical complexity together with stable and acceptable dependability indexes. Industry 4.0 is a term that describes the fourth generation of industrial activity which is enabled by smart systems and Internet-based solutions. Two of the characteristic features of Industry 4.0 are computerization by utilising cyber-physical systems and intelligent factories that are based on the concept of ``internet of things''. Maintenance is one of the application areas, referred to as maintenance 4.0, in form of self-learning and smart systems that predicts failure, makes diagnosis and triggers maintenance by making use of ``internet of things''. This paper discusses the possibilities that lie within applying the maintenance 4.0 concept in the railway transportation industry and the positive effects on technology, organisation and operations from a systems perspective.",

The massive deployment of Information and Communication Technologies makes this kind of systems available to anyone in the form of mobile applications. This paper reviews the available mobile applications for pollen information. After performing this analysis, we concluded that there is scope for research into new information systems for airborne allergens' information.

This project aims at exploring the fruitful integration of software personal agents with wearable/eyewear computing, based on mobile and wearable devices such as smart-glasses. The key functionality of Trauma Tracker is to keep track of relevant events occurring during the management of a trauma, for different purposes. The basic one -- discussed in detail in this paper -- is to have an accurate documentation of the trauma, to automate the creation (and management) of reports and to enable offline data analysis, useful for performance evaluation and to improve the work of the Trauma Team. Then, tracking is essential to conceive more involved assisting functionalities by the PMDA, from monitoring and warning generation to suggesting actions to perform---fully exploiting the hands-free interface of wearable technologies. This goes towards the idea -- envisioned in the paper -- of augmented physicians working in augmented hospitals, in which software personal agents are exploited along with enabling technologies from wearable and pervasive computing, augmented reality, to create novel smart environments to support individual and cooperative work of healthcare professionals.",

However, developing analytical applications for IoT is a difficult process as applications tend to be cross-domain and there are close relationships with the physical world. It is unreasonable to imagine that the application developers will possess all relevant skills and knowledge related to the domain, physical world, signal processing and deployment infrastructure. This paper presents an method that assists the IoT application developer by (i) providing an annotated repository of algorithms, (ii) recommending algorithms depending on the signal type to reduce the effort required from a signal processing expert, and (iii) providing a framework to execute the IoT application thereby reducing the development cost and time by capturing the knowledge of experts in models. We have evaluated our method by comparing the accuracy for a typical IoT application obtained by using the algorithms used by signal processing experts against the algorithms recommended by our method.",

The methods applied to reach the educational goals, concerning expert competence within remote diagnostics, have been on site and remote lectures given by engineering, medical and metrology experts. The pedagogical approach utilized has been flipped classroom. The main results show that academic courses developed in cooperation with industry requires flexibility, time and effort from the involved partners. The evaluation interviews indicate that student are satisfied with the courses and pedagogical approach but suggests more reconciliation meetings for course development. Labs early in the course was considered good, and division of labs at the system and the component level. However further long-term studies of evaluation of impact is necessary.",

abstract="Software forms an integral part of the most complex artifacts built by humans. Communication, production, distribution, healthcare, transportation, banking, education, entertainment, government, and trade all increasingly rely on systems driven by software. Such systems may be used in ways not anticipated at design time as the context in which they operate is constantly changing and humans may interact with them an unpredictable manner. However, at the same time, we are able to collect unprecedented collections of event data describing what people and organizations are actually doing. Recent developments in process mining make it possible to analyze such event data, thereby focusing on behavior rather than correlations and simplistic performance indicators. For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn end-to-end process models. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards ``better'' processes. Process mining reveals how people really work and often reveals what they would really like to do. Event-based analysis may reveal workarounds and remarkable differences between people and organizations. This keynote paper highlights current research on comparative process mining. One can compare event data with normative process models and see where people deviate. Some of these deviations may be positive and one can learn from them. Other deviations may reveal inefficiencies, design flaws, or even fraudulent behavior. One can also use process cubes to compare different systems or groups of people. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared.",

In this paper, an approach for automatic retinal image analysis on a smartphone is proposed, with emphasis on high sensitivity and fast computation. A set of 1200 images from the Messidor database were analyzed for extraction of features related to vessel segmentation, presence of exudates and microaneurysms. SVM and k-NN classifier models were trained with these features, resulting in a sensitivity of 87{\%} and a specificity of 66{\%}.

abstract="The development of the Internet and cloud computing has set up a matured environment for developing and deploying big data services. The main objective of requirements engineering for big data is to capture big data service users' needs and provider's capabilities, and to identify value added service use cases for big data technology in a given organizational context. Major objectives may include: collect real-time data about the world, search for useful information in large data sets, gain insights about given problems by data analytics, predict possible trend of interesting subjects, and make decisions for the next immediate actions. In this paper, we propose a big data service requirements analysis framework, which aims to provide useful guidelines for eliciting service requirements, selecting the right services architectures and evaluate the available technological services implementations. For services under operation, we suggest data analysis to service logs to elicit user's changing needs, to evaluate the run-time service performance and to check compliance to general standards and domain-specific regulations. Example cases from eHealth and industry 4.0 are discussed to illustrate the proposed service requirements framework.",

Design plays an important role in the definition of strategies and in the development of innovative solutions to tackle some of the contemporary problems society faces. This paper aims to show several projects developed over the last 5 years in the subject Design for Social Innovation at the Master in Design and the Master in Engineering and Product Design at the University of Aveiro, and its relation to the new social media and technologies. By using Service Design tools to improve Social Innovations and the integration of new digital technologies, we design new and improved solutions to foster sustainable development. The creation of a DESIS Lab has also allowed to develop innovative design solutions within local communities. The methodology used is based on Learning-by-Doing with an important and relevant initial phase using ethnographic methods. The results are showed as academic projects that can be applied and replicated in different contexts.",

abstract="Family care is the most accepted and preferred care setting for both long-term care patients and their relatives. However, many of these caregivers are elderly people themselves, and often reach the point where they also need support. Care poses a substantial burden, so often it is not the health of the patient but the overload of stress for the caregiver that results in the need for much more expensive professional care and even residential care. An ambient assisted living technology platform is developed to support both older adults and their carers to overcome the challenges of the care. The platform offers informal carers support by means of monitoring Activities of Daily Care as well as their psychological state, and will provide orientation to help them improve the care given. Monitored information will be registered by means of home-installed and personal sensor technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT), which will be as unobtrusive as possible for the house inhabitants.",

abstract="Logistics is a data-intensive industry. The information systems used by logistics companies generate massive volume of data which the companies store to perform different types of analysis. In addition, the advent of Big Data technologies and Internet of Things paradigm have given logistics companies an opportunity to use external data stemming from a wide variety of sources including sensors (e.g., GPS), social media and traffic controlling systems. The logistics companies aim to leverage the power of these external data and perform rigorous analysis in real-time to discover intelligence such as unpredictable delay. However, there are different challenges involved. One of the core challenges is integrating and processing a wide variety of data coming from heterogeneous sources. To the best of our knowledge, there is no off-the shelf solution which can address this challenge. In this paper, we present a framework called ProLoD which performs pre-processing and processing tasks with different types of data. Our framework relies on machine learning algorithms, for processing data; however, we found that the ready to use algorithms are not adequate to guarantee processing efficiency. Therefore, we extended an algorithm called Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. We evaluated ProLoD by comparing its performance with the HCL algorithm found in the widely-adopted machine learning tool called WEKA. We found that ProLoD is performing reasonably better than WEKA in terms of producing optimal number of clusters.",

This is known as Internet of things (IoT). Scalability of the entire system increases in case of more devices in IoT system. So in IoT system, main challenges are to maintain scalability and throughput. To meet these challenges, various architectures are used for implementing IoT applications such as SOAP-based, RESTful, broker-based SOA architecture. While service-oriented architecture provides system integration, interoperability, business agility. Though service-oriented architecture is mainly used for implementing various IoT applications, it faces some challenges such as security, interoperability, and context awareness. Event-driven service-oriented architecture (EDSOA) is a new architectural style which is an extension of broker-based architecture and most suitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we have tried to cover all these architectures.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) platforms are seen as a viable way for managing healthcare costs in an ever aging first world population. One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost ``off-the-shelf'' technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial ``observations from the field'' taken during the USEFIL AAL platform's integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

However, the process of eliciting and writing security requirements is tedious and complex, It requires Requirements Engineers (RE) to have security experience in the process of eliciting consistent security requirements from the clients-stakeholders. Considering the requirements are derived from natural language, RE faced problems in eliciting and writing security requirements as they have the tendency to misunderstand the real needs and the security terms used. Motivated from these problems, this paper proposed a security requirements library and template to assist RE in writing security requirements. The library was built based on compilation of security attributes derived from syntax analysis and keywords matching. The realization of the library and writing template was demonstrated using two sets of scenario taken from real projects. The usage examples show that the template is able to help the RE to write security requirements by providing the relevant and suitable sentence structure as guidance.",

In this work we present a conceptual framework to encourage the research community to develop more comprehensive and adaptive ICT solutions for prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions in the daily life of the aging population and beyond health facilities. We first present an overview of current international standards in human functioning and disability, and how chronic conditions are interconnected in older age. We then describe innovative mobile and sensor technologies, predictive data analysis in healthcare, and game-based prevention and rehabilitation techniques. We then set forth a multidisciplinary approach for the personalized prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions using unobtrusive and pervasive sensors, interactive activities, and predictive analytics, which also eases the tasks of health-related researchers, caregivers and providers. Our proposal represents a conceptual basis for future research, in which much remains to be done in terms of standardization of technologies and health terminology, as well as data protection and privacy legislation.",

abstract="Ubiquitous devices comprising several resource-constrained sensors and actuators while having the long desired Internet connectivity, are becoming part of many solutions that seek to enhance user's environment smartness and quality of living. Their intrinsic resource limitations however constitute critical requirements, such as security, a great challenge. When these nodes are associated with applications that might have an impact in user's privacy or even become life threatening, the security issues are of primary concern. Access to these resources should be appropriately controlled to ensure that such wearable nodes are adequately protected. On the other hand, it is very important to not restrict access to only a very closed group of entities. This work presents a service oriented architecture that utilizes policy-based, unified, cross-platform and flexible access control to allow authenticated entities consume the services provided by wearable nodes while protecting their valuable resources.",

Each year CVD causes over 4 million deaths in Europe alone and over 1.9 million deaths in the European Union (EU). According to the WHO (World Health Organization), in 2030 COPD will be the third leading cause of death, and the first cause of sanitary costs in Europe, due to the profiles of the expenses in health sector and the long time expenses by age groups and their important associate morbidity. New medical applications based on remote monitoring can help treat those chronic diseases but significantly will increase the volume of health information to manage, including data from medical and biological sensors, being then necessary to process this huge volume of data using techniques from Big Data.

abstract="Persuasive technology capitalizes on the use of technology and the art of persuasion to change the behaviors and attitudes of people without the use of coercion. They have been used at workplaces to achieve positive outcomes like increase in employee motivation, engagement and productivity. While a number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of Cialdini's principles of persuasion, little or no research has been conducted in the context of work environments. In many workplaces, it is important that employees provide detailed records of their activities for easy tracking of an organization's day-to-day activities and future historical reference. However, research has shown that some employees find it difficult to comply. In an attempt to address this problem, we carried out a pilot study among 20 healthcare Applied Behavior Analysis(ABA) frontline employees, working with autistic patients. The study is aimed at investigating how effective Cialdini's principles of persuasion are in motivating employees to record details about the sessions they have with patients. A Two-Way Mixed ANOVA analysis showed that ABA frontline employees are most susceptible to Commitment and Reciprocity, followed by Authority, and least susceptible to Consensus and Scarcity. These results suggest that designers of gamified persuasive systems tailored to healthcare ABA frontline staff should focus on implementing Commitment, Reciprocity and Authority as persuasive strategies aimed at motivating them in engaging in sufficient and quality data entry.",

The approach is based on the integration of a semantic framework, where a reasoner can take decisions about the configuration of robot services and resources. An ontology has been designed to model the robot and the relevant context information. Besides rules are used to encode human knowledge and serve as policies for the reasoner. The approach has been successfully implemented in a mobile robot, which showed to be more capable of solving not pre-designed situations.",

One strategy to meet these challenges is an increased focus on self-care via use of broader social networks and seamless integration of applications with lifestyle activities, particularly for people with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. There has also been a rapid increase in a range of technologies for connecting different components of the health system and delivering services through smartphones and connected devices.

abstract="The emergence of new technologies such as IoT and Big Data, the change in the behavior of society in general and the younger generation in particular, require higher education institutions to ``look'' for teaching differently. This statement is complemented by the prediction of the futurist Thomas Frey, who postulates that ``in 14 years it will be a big deal when students learn from robot teachers over the internet''. Thus, it is necessary to urgently begin a disruption of current teaching models, to be able to include in these processes the new technologies and the daily habits of the new generations. The early usage of mobile devices and the constant connection to the Internet (social networks, among others) mean that the current generation of young people, who are reaching higher education, has the most technological literacy ever. In this new context, this article presents a disruptive conceptual approach to higher education, using information gathered by IoT and based on Big Data {\&} Cloud Computing and Learning Analytics analysis tools. This approach will, for example, allow individualized solutions taking into account the characteristics of the students, to help them customize their curriculum and overcome their limitations and difficulties, throughout the learning process.",

abstract="Recently major emphasis is exerted on development of effective tools and techniques for enriching IoT development environment. Typically an IoT application, for example a health monitoring application, not only requires domain knowledge of a programmer, but also similar knowledge from a medical practitioner, a sensor manufacturer, an infrastructure manager, etc. Such involvement of several experts makes the development process complex, resulting in escalation of time and cost of the effort. Model Driven Development (MDD) has been proposed as a development technique where such problem can be mitigated. This paper presents a system based on the MDD paradigm. As a part of the system, we present a work-flow designer framework, a visual drag and drop interface, where a developer can stitch various functional models recommended from a well-organized, annotated and crowd-sourced semantic repository of algorithms (from various domains), named as Algopedia, to quickly build a semantic workflow and in turn an end to end IoT application.",

Growing smartphone users, increased sensing capabilities provided by smart phones, and the ability to share that data over the internet, presents an opportunity to build a mobile application that can provide an insight into mobility information through passive sensing. We have developed a mobile application to bridge the information gap by passively tracking tourist location and improvising tourist services using mobile crowd-sensing. Capabilities to cluster location data to form places of interest have been particularly focused in this paper. Finally, we present results for an initial experiment performed on a tourist to Australia.",

abstract="The term `Big Data' initially used by Roger Magoulas [1] from O'Reilly media in 2005 is all modern day large data sets and different stakeholders understand the phenomenon in multiple ways. Knowledge workers view Big Data as huge correlated data sets requiring super large computing powers to analyze the process and derive meaningful conclusions. Big Data is multidimensional data these days ranging from info-bytes from newspapers to online journals, from tweets to YouTube videos, social networking updates and blog discussions, which any business/organization is accumulating thru various information channels. The huge explosion of data and increase in Internet devices has led to the rapid rise of Big Data. Majority of data that contribute to Big Data comes from Internet sources or are Internet of Things. The scale of data set referred as ``Big Data can be defined as data that legacy DBMS tools can't load and understand the heterogeneous relationship.'' With the massive current technological advances the cutoff size of data sets qualifying as Big Data is bound to increase. We look at some of the underlying concepts of Big Data and propose solutions in Service Industry as there the quality of service is a key differentiator as compared traditional manufacturing industry where the quality of finished goods or product is important. The primary advantage of Big Data is by aggregating large amount of data integrated from various sources such as CRM, social media, email, web, mobile and tablet and data acquisition from other technologies. In this paper, we try to review the potential applications of Big Data in Service Industry and understand the source of its decision making data from Internet. We understand that the business is not interested in single data but desires to look at the trend and patterns in the data which might boost the business tremendously, and Internet of things would be creating streams of data needed for this purpose.",

abstract="In the not so distant future, if you wish to see a doctor, you'll either ``Uber'' one and your nearest on-demand healthcare provider will be at your doorstep within 15 min or else you'll book a videoconference with a virtual doctor who will carry out a remote consultation with the help of a full 24/7 record of your vital signs. These will be captured through one or several wearable sensors and a couple of handheld ``Robodoc'' consumer devices. Welcome to the brave new world of consumer-driven healthcare! Of course, we have seen this movie many times before. As set of technologies---nano, geno, driverless cars, the Internet of Things---comes out of its early developmental closet, technology pilots signal as-of-yet hard to measure future potential, investors glimpse a gold rush of opportunities, the media and industry analysts get involved, and a new hype curve is born (Brown and Michael 2003). Most likely, the technologies in question are first-phase evangelized and vilified in equal measures before being absorbed into our daily life and into existing markets in small, palatable steps that seem curiously less dramatic than the discourse that has surrounded these technologies at the beginning of their public lifecycle. However, as marketing researchers, we do not have much insight into the process through which a technology innovation hype is translated into a fully operational market. Most of the diffusion models that marketing researchers use are derivatives of Rogers' (1962) diffusion of innovation curve. Yet, Rogers' model and subsequent research in marketing has failed to accommodate how markets are actively and often painstakingly constructed, both in a socio-cognitive and material sense, by multiple, diverse, and often competing stakeholders.",

As a result of the technological evolution, new tools such as serious games are emerging, so their use in the field of physical therapy can modify the way patients face their treatments, promoting their motivation. Thus, we have developed a serious game based on image processing techniques to motivate and monitor patients with neurological diseases in their physical therapy practice.",

We approximate the behaviour of the algorithm using a Markov chain model and we analyse theoretically the cluster stability.

Smart care is needed to be implemented actively not only to reduce medical costs and improve the quality of medical services but also to ensure safety and quality of life for the elderly. However, multi-faceted efforts need to be made to help overcome the difficulties arising from degraded cognitive function of the elderly, considering the basic orientation of smart care such as mobile, smart, cloud computing, IoT, etc. For that, it would be necessary to develop elderly-friendly devices suited for characteristics of the elderly group and to actively deploy professional manpower, in parallel with active support from related organizations, who can provide instant support to the elderly encountering difficulty with the use, so as to stimulate the smart care service in the period ahead. Furthermore, as health information and privacy information generated in connection with individuals are sensitive data, it would be the most important to ensure that strict security is maintained for safe data transmission and that only necessary part of information is shared selectively.",

abstract="The approach presented in this position paper aims at collaborative service fusion and provisioning in user-centric environments in the future Internet of People, Things, and Services (IoPTS). Our approach connects dynamic gathering of user requirements and feedback with community based service fusion in any phase of a service life cycle. These highly adaptive services allow agile service creation and exploitation embedding the users by fusing his or her cloud based daily activities within intelligent environments. We propose two fundamental new building blocks: On the one hand a life management platform in our approach empowers users to manage service fusions, profiles, and access policies in a secure, trustworthy and unified way increasing their independency, privacy and possibilities to manage lives after personal priorities by personalized information flow. On the other hand the introduction of a service fusion engine supports automated access to personal consumer data and requirements for specifically authorized services and market places. Note: We think that with respect to recent discussions on profiling citizens and consumers user control and consent need to be re-balanced. As such the proposed life management platform is supposed to enable users to manage personally identifiable information.",

abstract="Domain Name System (DNS) plays an important role as a translation protocol in everyday use of the Internet. The purpose of DNS is to translate domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. However, its simple architecture can easily be misused for malicious activities. One huge security threat concerning DNS is tunneling, which helps attackers bypass the security systems unnoticed. A DNS tunnel can be used for three purposes: as a command and control channel, for data exfiltration or even for tunneling another protocol through it. In this paper, we surveyed different techniques for DNS tunneling detection. We classified those first based on the type of data and then within the categories based on the type of analysis. We conclude with a comparison between the various detection techniques. We introduce one real Advanced Persistent Threat campaign that utilizes DNS tunneling, and theoretically compare how well the surveyed detection techniques could detect it.",

The idea is to create a device that engage people to interact face-to-face, bringing old habits of drinking coffee as an excuse to socialize. Drinking coffee with friends is a world habit; in the south of Brazil the tradition to cultivate and drink coffee is very strong (especially in elderly people's life). The device is set to an ideal scenario and we can collect data from user's brewing coffee and therefore his daily consuming habits. The prototype is being improved before testing it with a large number of users and has providing new perspectives about the concept of ``OSN based on IoT'' and IoT to promote social interaction.",

However, the impact has been less than positive and it has been argued that interventional informatics using data-driven interventions is required to achieve evidence-based clinical decision-support. In this paper we discuss context-Aware, evidence-based, data driven development of diagnostic scales created using multi-disciplinary collaborative development. The goal is the development of novel dynamic scales for decision-support in healthcare provision and, while clinicians may derive benefit from such systems, there are potentially greater benefits for all stakeholders in medical triage systems using both face-to-face and remote consultations. While our focus lies in depression, the proposed approach will generalise to a diverse range of domains, systems, and technologies.",

The proposed method provides an array of parameters characterizing frequency restructuring of medical signals in different frequency bands. Since frequency fluctuations in brain and heart rhythms are closely related to different processes in human organism, the obtained data can allow us: to identify the disease at its early stages; to test the adaptive capacity of the human organism; to give diagnostic reports on cardiovascular and nervous systems; to analyze changes in rhythm during biofeedback sessions.

abstract="While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overload the bandwidth of a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Therefore, they can be used to launch ``physical'' denial-of-service attacks (PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the ``physical bandwidth'' of a CPS. In this paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted by malware for a PDoS attack. In order to model the recruitment of bots, we develop a ``Poisson signaling game,'' a signaling game with an unknown number of receivers, which have varying abilities to detect deception. Then we use a version of this game to analyze two mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet recruitment. Equilibrium results indicate that (1) defenders can bound botnet activity, and (2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This work provides a quantitative foundation for proactive PDoS defense.",

abstract="Hadoop has become a strategic data platform for by mainstream enterprises, adopted because it offers one of the fastest paths for businesses take to unlock value from big data while building on existing investments. Hadoop is a distributed framework based on Java that is designed to work with applications implemented using MapReduce modeling. This distributed framework enables the platform to pass the load to thousands of nodes across the whole Hadoop cluster. The nature of distributed frameworks also allows node failure without cluster failure. The Hadoop market is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next several years. Several tools and guides describe how to deploy Hadoop clusters, but very little documentation tells how to increase performance of Hadoop clusters after they are deployed. This document provides several BIOS, OS, Hadoop, and Java tunings that can increase the performance of Hadoop clusters. These tunings are based on lessons learned from Transaction Processing Performance Council Express (TPCx) Benchmark HS (TPCx-HS) testing on a Cisco UCS® Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data cluster. TPCx-HS is the industry's first standard for benchmarking big data systems. It was developed by TPC to provide verifiable performance, price-to-performance, and availability metrics for hardware and software systems that use big data.",

Hence there is a need for a smart parking management system assisting the users with the information about the availability of free parking slots at the entrance of the places like malls, organizations etc. they visit for avoiding congestion, irritation and tension. The proposed solution system in this paper tries to resolve this by detecting the available slots for parking in the parking area using IoT technologies and displaying the same on a webpage/display for user's kind reference. This system also provisions the users to book the free parking slot soon after entering the parking area thus solves the internal congestion inside the parking lot, saves their valuable time and relieves people from tension.",

abstract="Pathological shaking of the body or extremities is widely known and might occur at chronic diseases e.g. Parkinson. The rhythmical shaking, also known as tremor, can be such intense that extremities are flapping. Under certain circumstances, healthy people also show a shivering and shaking of their body. For example, humans start to shiver whenever it is too cold or if feelings such as stress or fear become dominant. Some wearable devices that are in direct contact to the body, such as smartwatches or smartglasses, provide a sensing functionality of acceleration force that is sufficient to detect the tremor of the wearer. The tremor varies in frequency and intensity and can be identified, by applying detection algorithms and signal filtering. Former works figured that all endotherms show muscle vibrations. These vibrations occur in the condition of sleeping as well as when being awake, or in unconsciousness. Furthermore, the vibrations are also present when subjects are physically active, emotionally stressed, or absolutely relaxed. The vibration itself varies in structure, amplitude, and frequency. This paper shows that these muscle vibrations are measureable by acceleration sensors attached to the user, and provides an outlook to new applications in the future. It also proves that custom mobile devices are able to detect body and muscle vibration and should motivate designers to develop new applications and treatment opportunities.",

abstract="Privacy-preserving data mining technologies have been studied extensively, and as a general approach, du Pin Calmon and Fawaz have proposed a data distortion mechanism based on a statistical inference attack framework. This theory has been extended by Erdogdu et al. to time-series data and been applied to energy disaggregation of smart-meter data. However, their theory assumes both smart-meter data and sensitive appliance state information are available when applying the privacy-preserving mechanism, which is impractical in typical smart-meter systems where only the total power usage is available. In this paper, we extend their approach to enable the application of a privacy-utility tradeoff mechanism to such practical applications. Firstly, we define a system model which captures both the architecture of the smart-meter system and the practical constraints that the power usage of each appliance cannot be measured individually. This enables us to formalize the tradeoff problem more rigorously. Secondly, we propose a privacy-utility tradeoff mechanism for that system. We apply a linear Gaussian model assumption to the system and thereby reduce the problem of obtaining unobservable information to that of learning the system parameters. Finally, we conduct experiments of applying the proposed mechanism to the power usage data of an actual household. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism works partly effectively; i.e., it prevents usage analysis of certain types of sensitive appliances while at the same time preserving that of non-sensitive appliances.",

A design of smart washing machine device using the IoT design methodology is being discussed using network configuration protocol (NETCONF) and yet another next generation (YANG) data modeling language to illustrate how it would be a better alternative for managing home network.",

abstract="Organizations are increasingly focused on using data to make their operational business processes more intelligent and reactive. Reactive performance monitoring consists of automating strategic decisions into rule-based actions when appropriate. Often there is a response gap, where there is unnecessary latency or missing detail, as the mapping between the strategic, the operational and the analytical is complex, labor intensive and not clearly defined. This paper presents an OLAP-modeled rule environment that leverages Complex Event Processing (CEP), multi-dimensionally modeled On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases and Business Process Management (BPM) to provide reactive performance monitoring. We use two case studies to evaluate our proposed architecture for an OLAP-modeled rule environment. The first case study prototyped the environment using IBM PMQ, while the second prototyped the environment using QuickForms and a custom-built OLAP rule engine. Predictive modeling, traditional rule engines, and our OLAP rule engine are compared in terms of their support for reactive performance monitoring.",

abstract="Smart objects are devices with computational and communication capabilities connected to the Internet forming the so called Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT enables many applications, for instance outdoor lighting control, smart energy and water management, or environmental sensing in a smart city environment. Security in such scenarios remains an open challenge due to the resource-constrained nature of devices and networks or the multiple ways in which opponents can attack the system during the lifecycle of a smart object. This paper firstly reviews security and operational goals in an IoT scenario inspired in a smart city environment. Then, we present a comprehensive and lightweight security architecture to secure the IoT throughout the lifecycle of a device. Our solution relies on the lightweight HIMMO scheme -- a novel key pre-distribution scheme that is both collusion resistance and efficient -- as the building stone enabling not only efficient resource-wise but also advanced and scalable IoT protocols and architectures. Our design and analysis show that our HIMMO-based security architecture can be easily integrated in existing communication protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4 or OMA LWM2M providing a number of advantages that existing solutions cannot provide both performance and operation-wise.",

abstract="The widely use of advanced technologies in the sensor network and computing has facilitated the development of convenient pervasive applications in order to access information at anytime and anywhere. The traditional access control mechanisms cannot appropriately protect the access and usage of digital resources in the highly distributed and heterogeneous computing environment. In such an environment, enforcing continuously the access control policies during the access period is a challenge because traditional authorization decisions are generally made at the time of access requests but do not consider ongoing controls. Obligations are the vital part of many access control policies and they specify mandatory behavior that should be conducted by a user of the access control system in sensitive domains. Therefore, utilizing a mechanism to approve the fulfillment of the obligation is required for continuing or revoking the access decision. We leveraged the capability of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to manage the communication between entities in order to provide a mechanism to handle the continuous enforcement of the obligation. Meanwhile, we present several scenarios which indicate our proposed model can manage the obligatory behavior that affects the continuity of access to resources in pervasive computing environment.",

Many large mechanic and aircraft engineering companies have already adopted additive manufacturing technologies in their future production strategy. The general concept of 3D printer on the basis of e-manufacturing principles is aimed at integration of computer models of physical objects and processes. This change requires a deep transformation into enterprise business model, affecting either core or support activities. For instance, additive manufacturing could also change product lifecycle and supply chain management practices.

We argue that this development creates new challenges in designing ethically responsible persuasive technologies. Applications in social contexts like work environments raise the questions whether persuasion serves the interests of the user or the employer, and whether users can still voluntarily choose to use the technology. Informing the user and obtaining consent become complicated when persuasive systems are integrated in smart environments. To ensure that the autonomy of the user is respected, we argue that the user and provider should agree on the goal of persuasion, and users should be informed about persuasion in smart environments.",

abstract="In 2007, RFIDs are not only a challenge for the fields of computer science and economics, but also for law. This paper develops a framework for RFID legislation and RFID lobbyism. With the coordinates ``globality, verticality, ubiquity and technicity'', the establishment of scenarios (RTAMP, RTAMA, EPC, AGG) and the exemplary categorization of pioneer legislature initiatives in the USA, the discussion about RFID law will be focused and qualified. The opinion presented in this article is that traditional privacy law is not sufficient to meet the challenges of RFID (Bag Paradigm).",

There will be the great effect on human life by Internet of Things (IOT), because with the help of IOT, many impossible things will become possible. IOT devices generates big data having useful, valuable and highly accurate data. It is difficult to extract the required information or data from the set of big data discovered by any device. For this purpose, data mining is used. Data mining will plays important role in constructing smart system that provides convenient services. It is required to extract data and knowledge from the connected things. For this purpose, various data mining techniques are used.

Physiological multi-sensor studies have been conducted previously to detect stress. In this study, we focus on electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring that can now be performed with minimally invasive wearable patches and sensors, to develop an efficient and robust mechanism for accurate stress identification, for example in automobile drivers. A unique aspect of our research is personalized individual stress analysis including three stress levels: low, medium and high. Using machine learning algorithms from the ECG signals alone, our system achieves up to 100{\%} accuracy and area under ROC curve of 1 depending on the experimental setting in detecting three classes of stress using feature selection from a combination of fiducial points and multiscale entropy as a fine-grained indicator of stress level.",

pages="269--280",
abstract="In the world of Internet of Things (IoT), huge number of resource constrained devices are directly accessible over the Internet. For allowing the constrained devices to exchange information, the IETF standard group has specified the CoAP which works on top of UDP/IP. Also, Datagram TLS (DTLS) binding is recommended to make the CoAP secure. When DTLS is enabled, a device can select one of three security modes that are PreSharedKey, RawPublicKey and Certificate mode. Especially, the RawPublicKey mode, which uses an asymmetric-key pair without a certificate, is mandatory to implement CoAP over DTLS. But there are several challenges in using the asymmetric-key based secure mode in resource constrained device. This paper compares the RawPublicKey mode and the PreSharedKey mode, which uses a symmetric-key, to discuss DTLS performance in resource constrained devices and networks. For the comparison, we implemented an experimental environment based on IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks consisting of resource constrained devices in the Cooja Simulator and in the real test-bed as well. Then we analyze the comparison results with regard to code size, energy consumption and processing and receiving time.",

abstract="The widespread introduction of lightweight IT---smartphones, tablets, the Internet of Things, and the growth of third-party app developers---has become a challenge for many organizations. Local units and end-users increasingly are acquiring and implementing lightweight IT outside the realm of the IT function. The trend is driven by competent users' need for innovative IT services, enabled by the consumerization of digital technologies. Lightweight IT entails exciting business opportunities; however, guidance for managers on how to deal with this development has been very limited. In this paper, we investigate which IT governance models organizations can apply to manage lightweight IT. The managerial challenge is to balance the innovative potential of lightweight IT with the requirements of good governance. Building on the particular challenges of lightweight IT and the extant literature on end-user computing, we present a framework with four alternative governance models. We evaluate the framework through four e-health case studies.",

To support healthy and safe living of elderly individuals, a system that can monitor their activities of daily living is needed. This paper proposes a handrail-shaped sensor as a new Internet of Things (IoT)-type sensing system for long-term monitoring of the mobility of elderly people. The handrail-shaped sensor detects changes in mobility using information on movement velocity and the degree of dependence on the handrail. To evaluate the effectiveness of the sensor, we first assessed the accuracy of estimating the position of the load applied to the handrail in our laboratory. We then field-tested the handrail sensor in the home of an 88-year-old woman. The experimental results show that the handrail sensor can estimate the walking speed as well as the grasping position of an elderly person in an actual daily living environment.",

abstract="This paper describes biometric-based cryptographic techniques that use weak secrets to provide strong, multi-factor and mutual authentication, and establish secure channels for subsequent communications. These techniques rely on lightweight cryptographic algorithms for confidential information exchange. Lightweight algorithms are suitable for use in resource constrained environments such as the Internet of Things where implementations require efficient execution, limited access to memory and small code size. Password Authenticated Key Exchange, and Biometric Authenticated Key Exchange protocols based on user knowledge extracted from biometric sensor data, both rely on weak secrets. These secrets are shared between a client and an access controlled server, and used as inputs to Diffie-Hellman key establishment schemes. Diffie-Hellman provides forward secrecy, prevents user credentials from being exposed during identity authentication attempts, and thwarts man-in-the-middle and phishing attacks. This paper describes the operation of these protocols using an adaptive knowledge substitution process that frequently modifies the weak secrets used for protocol operation without requiring disruptive user password changes. The password substitution strings used to implement this process can be far longer and more complex than the weak secrets people can easily memorize. The process described in this paper allows people with diverse abilities to use simple, easily recalled, quickly entered passwords and still benefit from the strength of long, complex strings when operating cryptographic protocols.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment in which ``things'' (objects, animals or people) are provided with unique identifiers (IPv6 addresses) and the ability to communicate over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Radio-Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) is the key enabler of the IoT. The RFID Implant System considered in the proposed work consists of an implantable, passive RFID tag which is a data carrying device that is attached to the object to be identified, RFID reader which communicates with the tag in order to read or write data to its memory and, the back-end database which stores information related to the identified object. There are several security issues associated with the use of RFID tags in IoT like eavesdropping, impersonation, cloning, replay attack, tag destruction, unauthorized tag reading, tag modification etc. To defend such attacks effectively, efficient security mechanisms are essential. So, the proposed system aims to provide a secure mutual authentication mechanism based on Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) to authenticate the communication between the RFID tag and reader. The security of Hyper-elliptic Curve Cryptosystem depends on the hardness of solving hyper-elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (HCDLP). This problem helps to avoid the eavesdropper from breaking into the security of the HECC cryptosystem. The proposed work also uses D-Quark hash algorithm.",

Smart building is an important aspect of the IoT. During traffic and evacuation, to facilitate the passage of occupants, signage systems are widely used in the built environment. Due to the complex layout of large buildings, rapid evacuation is making way finding difficult. The need for exit signs that take into account when this should be evident, redirecting individuals to not only an exit but rather a practical and optimal way out in an evolving emergency situation has facilitated the improvement of another era of cutting edge signage. Conventional signage cannot adapt to changing conditions because it only conveys single and passive information, and displays static content with limited user interactivity. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a dynamic active emergency signage system architecture `DSS-SL' based of SDN. We also present a low power LED-based visible lighting communication between smart devices and forwarding switches inside the building.",

abstract="Data collection is one of the fundamental functions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Different from traditional data collection mechanisms which only consider a single and stationary sink, this paper studies this problem in a scenario with multiple mobile sinks. The motivation is for a WSN to support future applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT). In this case, a WSN is required to be able to deliver sensing results to multiple users moving around the network. There are two difficulties in this problem: sink mobility and multiple sinks. Since sinks are mobile, data delivery paths need to be updated frequently, which causes huge maintenance cost. To resolve this problem, we propose a hop-count based data collection architecture together with an efficient mobility management scheme. On the other side, sensing results from a large number of sensors are sent to multiple sinks, which causes lots of packet transmissions. To resolve this problem, we combine the idea of multicast and data aggregation. We first prove that the optimal multicast decision is a NP-hard problem and then propose a distributed heuristic solution. In addition, we further integrate data aggregation into multicast and propose a distributed many-to-many aggregation mechanism.

This is especially true in the clinical field, where omitting significant information can have considerable implications for diagnosis and treatment in general. History taking from patients represents a crucial phase for physicians in order to evaluate the patient's wellness status and to perform correct diagnoses. As a routine procedure, it is a time-consuming and not so appealing obligation. In this paper we present a smart approach to anamnesis in order to gain as much data as possible and to have high quality information by avoiding any misunderstandings or errors. The approach is mainly based on the possibility to capture data directly at the source increasing the overall effectiveness of physician's time and of the visit itself. Its feasibility has been evaluated in the context of a complex clinical domain: maternal and fetal assessment during pregnancy.",

As data volumes continue to increase exponentially, the challenge is not only how to store and manage data but also to effectively analyse the data to gain insight knowledge to make smarter decisions. One of the key challenges is transforming the raw data available to your business into business value and strategic advantage. The better management and analysis of Big Data will become the next frontier of innovation, competition and productivity. For example, according to a McKinsey Global Institute study, a retailer exploiting the full potential of big data could increase its operating margin by more than 60 percent; efficient and effective use of big data could save more than {\$}300 billion dollars for US government in healthcare alone.

abstract="Ten years ago, researchers in multi-agent systems became more and more aware that agent systems consist of more than only agents. The series of workshops on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS 2004-2006) emerged from this awareness. One of the primary outcomes of this endeavor was a principled understanding that the agent environment should be considered as a primary design abstraction, equally important as the agents. A special issue in JAAMAS 2007 contributed a set of influential papers that define the role of agent environments, describe their engineering, and outline challenges in the field that have been the drivers for numerous follow up research efforts. The goal of this paper is to wrap up what has been achieved in the past 10 years and identify challenges for future research on agent environments. Instead of taking a broad perspective, we focus on three particularly relevant topics of modern software intensive systems: large scale, openness, and humans in the loop. For each topic, we reflect on the challenges outlined 10 years ago, present an example application that highlights the current trends, and from that outline challenges for the future. We conclude with a roadmap on how the different challenges could be tackled.",

Losing their everyday independence is a major concern for the elderly, partly because they fear this could lead to an involuntary move to an assisted living facility instead of living independently. Since 2015, the Dutch government encourages their citizens to age-in-place, but at the same time struggles with how to implement new healthcare regulations. To support both government and citizens, we propose a digital platform to match supply and demand in the health and wellbeing domain. Such a platform should not only enable end-users to enhance self-management, but also support them to find solutions for everyday problems related to aging-in-place. To illustrate our Action Design Research we established a Living Lab in a metropolitan area in the Netherlands, and developed a prototype of the proposed platform in a real-life setting.",

To avoid audio signal distortion, proposed system embeds watermark in a secret key of identity by visual cryptography rather than audio signal. The secret shares generated through visual cryptography are inserted in the secret watermark key by computing the features of audio signals. The proposed technique is evaluated using audio samples taken from voice disorder database of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). Experimental results prove that the proposed technique achieves imperceptibility with reliability to extract identity, unaffected disorder detection result with high robustness.

Therefore there is an urgent call for developing efficient strategies which could reduce the healthcare costs and meet the demand of older ill people at affordable cost. One of such approaches is the use of mobile devices and applications. The purpose of this study is to explore mobile devices and/or mobile applications which are used in the assessment, management and treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The findings show that mobile devices and smart-based apps can serve as an appropriate assessment, diagnostic, monitoring and treatment tools for patients with PD since they are relatively cost-effective, reliable and non-invasive. However, more research has to be done in the area of their use in the treatment of PD symptoms, as well as more randomized controlled trials with larger samples of subjects should be conducted.",

abstract="ICT has a significant role in the development and production of municipal services, and in the daily work of municipal civil servants. Yet, municipalities typically develop and operate their ICT activities independently with limited ICT resources, both money and people. Limited resources are the key incentive for inter-municipal ICT cooperation. This article investigates how ICT cooperation is carried out within 20 municipal regions. As the theoretical basis we review transaction cost economics (TCE), resource based view (RBV) and the constructs of Granovetter's social network theory. They are used to outline potential economic and social benefits emerging from ICT cooperation and to describe social mechanisms that influence the realization of such benefits. Our empirical data reveals that there are distinct differences in the effectiveness of ICT activities, in the amount of ICT cooperation and in the governance of ICT cooperation. Our analysis reveals that the emperor will not have clothes -- ICT cooperation benefits -- unless the cooperation is properly organized and governed.",

abstract="Nowadays, new portable devices are constantly being launched with their ever greater application to an ever growing number of domains. These devices or wearables (from wearable computing) are present in many different areas ranging from healthcare to entertainment, and provide a series of features to enhance the quality of everyday life. When used in conjunction with other wearables, they give rise to wireless body area networks (WBAN) or body area networks (BAN). The large variety of devices along with the lack of standardized services, which means that each designer or engineer must customize the API design, forces developers to implement source code mostly from scratch in order to cope with the heterogeneity of wearables and support their integration on a wider system. The result of these drawbacks is that new device integration is hampered and the time spent on the software development process is increased and these problems are addressed in this paper. We propose a model-driven approach based on a meta-model which has been designed to define and specify interaction with sensors. Our main aim is to distance developers from specific implementation and to cope with heterogeneous designs. The resulting models, which are instances of the proposed meta-model, are specified in a custom language which we call the wearable markup language (WML). We also introduce the coordinator, i.e. component-based software for handling sensor models and improving the integration of new sensors.",

abstract="This paper shows the development of a mobile application prototype that allows the identification of the average waiting times in a queuing system for different branch offices or points of care. This application gives a person the possibility to select the alternative that best suits him/her, showing the nearby points of care by average waiting times in each point. The validation of the operation of this prototype is carried out through the Flexsim queue simulator, through which random cases are generated from branch offices referenced from Google Maps. With this, it is possible to give a hierarchical order according to the shortest waiting time and indicating the location of these points of care on the map. In order to implement the application it is necessary to install sensors in the points of care, linked to an online database through IoT, so that this information can be visualized in the mobile application.",

Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are used for meeting the real-time requirements for the real-time systems; this makes the IoT applications have the RTOS features like reliability. There are many IoT Platforms have been created, but the most of them are done for specific applications and don't handle the real-time constraints of the real-time systems. In this paper, a design and implementation for an IoT Platform will be proposed for general applications, especially the critical applications for the real-time systems. Also, Many Communication Protocols are used in the IoT Platforms as the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, but many of them don't support the Multi-Topic Messaging. In this paper a simple communication protocol will be presented, it enhances the delay and the traffic needed for the multi-topic messaging by supporting the multi-topic feature, a performance analysis for the proposed protocol versus the MQTT will be studied.",

Interesting research questions arise due to this convergence. For example, how to efficiently retrieve underlying contexts that are difficult to recognize especially with resource-limited handheld devices, how to make use of these contexts for achieving self-management, and how to process large-scale contexts.

abstract="The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has provided innovative solutions to reduce traffic accidents caused by fatigue driving. When drivers are in bad mood or tired, their vigilance level decreases, which may prolong the reaction time to emergency situation and lead to serious accidents. With the help of mobile sensing and mood-fatigue detection, drivers' mood-fatigue status can be detected while driving, and then appropriate measures can be taken to eliminate the fatigue or negative mood to increase the level of vigilance. This paper presents the basic concepts and current solutions of mood-fatigue detection and some common solutions like mobile sensing and cloud computing techniques. After that, we introduce some emerging platforms which designed to promote safe driving. Finally, we summarize the major challenges in mood-fatigue detection of drivers, and outline the future research directions.",

abstract="Edge analytics is an approach to data collection and analysis in which an automated analytical computation is performed on data at a sensor, network switch or other devices instead of waiting for the data to be sent back to a centralized data store. The data collection merits for normal edge operations but limits for the handling of anomaly events and prediction of prognostics conditions. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning edge approach that extends Kalman filter for anomaly detection so as to (a) allow the edge to adaptively collect granular data when abnormal or anomaly data markers witnessed for prognostics and (b) relaxes the data collection frequency for normal device operation cycles. In summary, the adaptive edge analytics fine-tunes the data collection and analysis so that overall health and longevity of the device can be improved.

This system can manage an undefined amount of clustered networks. The proposed system architecture enables Internet communications to reach the WSN in a highly efficient way. This structure reduces the bottleneck of the Internet/WSN bridge and the amount of messages inside the WSN when an Internet request arrives. Besides, each individual WSN implements an Intelligent Rule-Based System Automation (IRBSA) that performs the automation of the behaviour of the network motes according to the previously included rules. These rules describe the actions that are executed when all the conditions of that rule are met. Opposite to traditional approaches, IRBSA is placed in the WSN Header Mote rather than in the Internet server or in every mote.",

This design is based on the IEEE1451.2 standards. It stipulates the hardware and software design framework.

The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of `ambient assisted living' as an instantiation of the concept of `intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the idea of `ambient assisted living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.",

However, practical applications of such systems will be possible only if they can generate real time medical grade data in environment having radical noise. This paper details the design and development of B.E.A.T. ® - an innovative system which captures medical grade physiological signals using 2 leads with or without the use of pre-gelled electrodes over Android OS.",

abstract="The availability of NFC smartphones has facilitated the development of a large number of related applications. Some of these NFC applications necessitate communication with other systems, which may not necessarily be secure, through communication channels and mechanisms that may be open to vulnerabilities. Security is therefore paramount to the success of these NFC mobile services. While Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication mode is common in mobile NFC applications, it is vulnerable to security-related issues that arise from the use of untrusted devices for storage and to process applications. We propose the concept of a Cloud of Secure Elements (CoSE) where the secure services are hosted by servers rather than by smartphone Secure Elements. We discuss the use of CoSE for mobile payments. We also illustrate how an NFC smartphone may be efficiently used as a bridge between an NFC reader and an Internet server of secure microcontroller that hosts EMV applications.",

abstract="As a result of the remarkable advances in sensing and digital communication technologies, massive amounts of data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we propose a framework for data provisioning that relies on the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud delivery model. IoT Data is processed and aggregated at the edge of where it is generated, then, it is stored in the cloud. Since smart connected devices are proliferating at an unprecedented pace, we anticipate that the number of DaaS providers will also grow at the same rate. Therefore, data consumers will seek to find suitable DaaS providers that can provide them with high-quality data. DaaS Brokers will emerge to mediate between data providers and data consumers and help data consumers find appropriate DaaS providers using different ranking algorithms. We propose an algorithm to evaluate the offers of potential DaaS providers based on the quality-of-data (QoD) requirements of the data consumer and using fitness functions associated with each QoD dimension.",

We will first look at open government data, whose ability to be reused enables them to act as tools for generating knowledge and offering new government services and products. We will then turn to big data, whose use carries complex legal and social consequences, and which also serve as a key tool for creating knowledge by making it possible to plot and forecast economic and social trends.

abstract="Providing assurance that self-adaptive software meets its dependability, performance and other quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is a great challenge. Recent approaches to addressing it use formal methods at runtime, to drive the reconfiguration of self-adaptive software in provably correct ways. One approach that shows promise is runtime quantitative verification (RQV), which uses quantitative model checking to reverify the QoS properties of self-adaptive software after environmental, requirement and system changes. This reverification identifies QoS requirement violations and supports the dynamic reconfiguration of the software for recovery from such violations. More importantly, it provides irrefutable assurance evidence that adaptation decisions are correct. In this paper, we survey recent advances in the development of efficient RQV techniques, the application of these techniques within multiple domains and the remaining research challenges.",

Reduction of peak resource usage, dynamic control of service rate corresponding to arrival rate and QoS buffer management are few main factors considered to develop this strategy. By calculating percentage of link bandwidth required for prioritized traffic in each cycle, we provide quality of service (QoS) to real time traffic in IoT and non-IoT applications. Different experiments including MPEG traffic traces and Poisson traffic are conducted to verify the proposed scheduler. Also, performance of scheduler for both IoT and Non-IoT applications is compared for different data rates. We observe that the proposed packet scheduler satisfies QoS requirements for both IoT and non-IoT traffic.",

A Process Management System (PMS) employed for executing CPPs is required to automatically adapt its running processes to anomalous situations and exogenous events by minimising any human intervention at run-time. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing an approach and an adaptive Cognitive PMS that combines process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and automated resolution strategies leveraging on well-established action-based formalisms in Artificial Intelligence, which allow to interpret the ever-changing knowledge of cyber-physical environments and to adapt CPPs by preserving their base structure.",

Security of the data in the network is based on the cryptographic technique and the way in which encryption and decryption keys are established among the nodes. Managing the keys in the network includes node authentication, key agreement and key update phases which poses an additional overhead on network resources. Both Symmetric and Asymmetric key techniques when applied separately in WSN fails to provide a scheme suitable for wide range of applications. Hybrid key management scheme is scalable alternative to match security requirements of WSN with minimum overhead on available resources. Heterogeneous WSN is considered in which ID based key establishment and polynomial based key pre-distribution scheme are proposed for higher and lower level of hierarchy respectively. The results of the proposed hybrid key management scheme indicate reduced resource overhead and improved security level.",

In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for brain waves and, encryption and decryption time of cipher algorithms. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data. For experimental results, when using our system the concentration is 80 [{\%}] from 0 [s] to 400 [s]. But, for 400 [s] to 1000 [s], concentration is decreased. In the case of not using our system, concentration is almost the same (about 40 [{\%}]) from 0 [s] to 1000 [s].

abstract="Sensor network is made up of a large number of sensor nodes for communication. Some nodes can work as a gateway which transmits data to the sink. These nodes are considered as a bottleneck in multi-hop networks because they send data collected from other nodes, and hence it drains their energy quickly. This problem is known as Hot Spot problem. So, for balancing the energy throughout the network, sink and node mobility can be used. A mobile sink could collect data without the need of gateway, and hence the problem of a bottleneck in the multi-hop network can be minimized. Along with the sink, sensor nodes also can be made mobile. Energy efficiency of WSN is achieved by using mobile sensors and mobile sink with enhanced coverage, and better channel capacity. There are various routing protocols to reduce energy consumption in a mobile WSN. This review paper mainly concentrates on the study of different protocols that are used for efficient energy consumption using the mobile sink and mobile sensor nodes.",

We propose a user-centric paradigm called ``Personal Service Eco-Environment (PSE2)'' which plays as a ``personal assistant'' of each user. PSE2 is composed of personal data, services, and social relations around a user, and fully-personalized service/social collaboration solutions are to be planned on the basis of the individualized characteristics extracted from his personal data and the dynamic multi-end context.

abstract="Dealing with the risks in information sharing technology, role based access control(RBAC) mechanism has more advantages than traditional access control mechanism like DAC and MAC. Role takes core position in both building, maintaining the architecture of the RBAC system and migrating the non-RBAC system to the RBAC system. Then role engineering is proposed to find the appropriate roles for the RBAC system. Role mining problem, as an automatic way to find the roles, has been a hotspot for the role engineering. In this paper, we briefly introduce the basic definition of RBAC. A contribution of this paper is to classify some of the exist method into clustering methods and Binary Matrix Decomposition Method. We also evaluate some of these methods on both real-world data and experimental data. At last, we analyze the results to find out what differences may appear using different method and dataset.",

abstract="In the biomedical signal analysis and transmission, procreation of radio frequency communication technology is recurrently perplexed by electromagnetic interference. This effect can be eliminated by using visible light as a medium of transmission. In this work, Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) transmitter and receiver sections have been designed using white light emitting diode (LED) and photodiode, respectively. For demonstration, we transmitted electrocardiogram signal from Li-Fi transmitter to receiver and the performance has been analysed for various transmission distances. Further enhancement of this work has been proposed as an all-optical health monitoring system that is suitable for hospital environment. In hospitals, VLC is the efficient wireless data communication technology in health monitoring. VLC ensures secured, faster way of communication and use of unlicensed visible spectrum. This enhanced scheme uses biomedical sensors that detect specific biological, chemical, or physical changes that occur in a patient's body. Biological data are transmitted by an array of LEDs. Biomedical signal processing in both transmitter and receiver sections is performed by Arduino unit. The proposed research work focuses on developing a high-speed eco-friendly local area communication network with low-cost, off-the-shelf components for interconnecting electronic devices within hospital environment.",

In this paper, we propose a framework that assigns, deploys business process from cloud onto mobile devices and executes them in disconnected environments. To model the process assignment and execution on mobile devices, we extend BPMN with context constraints such as location and hardware resources. The proposed framework benefits from centralized process model management and the distributed process execution on mobile devices, regardless of the constant access to cloud.

They are used in domains like building automation, control systems, remote healthcare, etc., which are all highly process-driven. Today, tools and insights of Business Process Modeling (BPM) are not used to model WSN logic, as BPM focuses mostly on the coordination of people and IT systems and neglects the integration of embedded IT. WSN development still requires significant special-purpose, low-level, and manual coding of process logic. By exploiting similarities between WSN applications and business processes, this work aims to create a holistic system enabling the modeling and execution of executable processes that integrate, coordinate, and control WSNs. Concretely, we present a WSN-specific extension for Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and a compiler that transforms the extended BPMN models into WSN-specific code to distribute process execution over both a WSN and a standard business process engine. The developed tool-chain allows modeling of an independent control loop for the WSN.",

Moreover, we instantiate an efficient protocol for private and unforgeable data aggregation that allows the Aggregator to compute the sum of users' inputs without learning individual values and constructs a proof of correct computation that can be verified by any third party.

In this paper we argue that there is a lack of research done about the data quality and quality of awareness particularly in this kind of composite systems. We investigate on how to build the semantic layer of the DOHA middleware due to reach the goal of context-awareness. To achieve that we are using a data quality approach and data profiles.

abstract="Advances in wireless communication technologies and the internet of things are leading to new developments in the domain of wearable, smart medical devices (SMDs) as a major disruptive trend for the medical industry. Wearable smart sensor technology with non-invasive or invasive implantable materials has a great potential for interfacing with the human body, thanks to low-power silicon-based electronics that are very efficient in data processing and transmission. Novel SMDs are designed for monitoring living being's vital signs, such as blood pressure, cardiac monitoring, respiration rate, body temperature, etc. in either medical diagnostic or health monitoring. Considering various smart devices in the medical industry, a key decision is which device to choose and apply on the patient. The decision on the evaluation of SMDs is a complicated problem that needs to be assessed from different perspectives. This study guides decision makers on the selection of SMDs of wearable vital sign sensors under different evaluation criteria. A multi criteria decision making approach is proposed to support the SMD selection process under group decision making (GDM) in an uncertain environment. A significant feature of this analysis is the complexity of the selected decision criteria for the SMD evaluation. To simulate these processes, a methodology that combines interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) with Vi{\v{s}}ekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje (VIKOR) under GDM is proposed. This methodology is then used to measure the assessment of four SMDs using five evaluation criteria. To validate the proposed approach, the selection methodology for wearable vital sign monitoring devices is applied on a case study.",

In this paper we propose an IoT application to alert the medical doctor assigned to a critical unit by using a smart-watch. The wearable device improves the efficacy of monitoring patients at risk in hospital units allowing the medical doctor to access information at any time and from any place. A network was built to wirelessly connect bio-sensing platforms, which measure metabolites concentration in patients' fluids (e.g. blood), with a dedicated application running on the smart-watch. In case of anomalous measured values, incoming alert notifications are received to ask urgent medical intervention. The main advantage of this new approach is that the doctors, or in general the caregivers, can freely move in the hospital other structures and perform other tasks meanwhile simultaneously and constantly monitoring all the patients thanks to the technology on their wrist.",

abstract="The empty nest syndrome has become a significant problem in many countries. Caregivers can help the elderly to cope with some of the issues related to this syndrome, but a tremendous shortage of caregivers is expected due to the low income and high workload. The growing popularity of mobile device use by the elderly has created a great potential for mobile virtual companions. Studies have shown that virtual companions that can show empathy towards its users are perceived as more caring, likeable, trustworthy and supportive. Therefore, we believe that an empathetic companion can help to improve the elderly's emotional wellness and promote an active independent lifestyle. In this work, we propose an empathetic elderly companion based on the psychological theory of empathy in the form of a smart chat bot. The empathetic companion records the elderly's speech during their conversations, extracts phonetic features, and employs a fast online learning algorithm, namely Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM), to recognize emotion. Based on the elderly's current emotion, the companion will provide context-aware empathetic responses. The experimental results show that OS-ELM is superior in classifying emotions from phonetic information.",

abstract="The analysis of human motion has become a major application area in computer vision. The vast majority of applications require using video cameras as main sensor for acquisition, analysis and detection of human motion. Some applications are very sensitive to the acquisition of images of people that may feel violated his right to privacy. Especially in ambient intelligence applications, non intrusive nature, whose scope is the user's home. The scope of this work was constrained to the analysis of human motion obtained from signals acquired for PIR sensors. We propose a method to classify PIR signals regarding two parameters: speed and distance from sensor to the subject. Our method allows to get compact devices that perform local computation and are able to transmit middle abstraction level context information in an efficient way. Signals from a PIR sensor array generated by several subjects have been registered to get patterns. Subjects moved at a certain speed at a given distance from sensors, so patterns are indexed by these two parameters. The patterns are then used to classify other tests signals regarding the mentioned parameters. The hit rate, for the method which combines information from all the sensors in the array, results in 79{\%} for distance classification, 96{\%} for speed classification and 77{\%} for classification regarding both parameters simultaneously. We consider that this is a satisfying result for a non intrusive method.",

The success of this model has been demonstrated over many years by deployment of a variety of solutions for a diverse group of stakeholders, and an ever-growing demand for expansion. A few selected projects are presented in this paper to illustrate the skills acquired by students which include training in state-of-the-art technologies, creative thinking, research publications, and prospects for immediate hiring upon graduation.

The economic and societal potential is greater than that we have already witnessed with mobile consumer devices.

abstract="Energy-efficient computing has increasingly come into focus of research and industry over the last decade. Ultra-low-power architectures are a requirement for distributed sensing, wearable electronics, Internet of Things and consumer electronics. In this paper, we present a dual-mode platform that includes an ultra-low power Cortex Arm M4 microcontroller coupled with a highly energy efficient multi-core parallel processor. The platform is designed to maximize the energy efficiency in sensors applications by exploiting the Cortex Arm M4 to achieve ultra-low power processing and power management, and enables the multi-core processor to provide additional computational power for near-sensor data centric processing (i.e. accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification) increasing energy efficiency. The proposed platform enhances the application scenarios where on-board processing (i.e. without streaming out the sensor data) enables intensive computation to extract complex features. The platform is geared towards applications with limited energy budget, as for example in mobile or wearable scenarios where the devices are supplied by a battery. Experimental results confirm the energy efficiency of the platform, demonstrate the low power consumption, and the benefits of combining the two processing engines. Compared to a pure microcontroller platform we provide a boost of 80{\texttimes} in terms of computational power when running general purpose code and a boost of 560{\texttimes} when performing convolutions. Within a reasonable power budged of 20 mW compatible to battery-operated scenarios the system can perform 345 MOPS of general purpose code or 1.5 GOPS of convolutions.",

abstract="A reliable, secure, and real-time data collection from sensor devices to the end-user is an open research problem. Many research works have been focusing on the wireless communication level to obtain quality of service. This paper widens the problem, and provides a comprehensive system design, where it covers all the elements in a remote health monitoring application. The system collects measurements in a relational database, either through a C{\#}.NET or a LabVIEW program. The end-user is able to observe either real-time data (i.e. with insignificant delay) or processed historical data on any web browser. We have shown that the inclusion of the relational database may impose a need for the data to be buffered before inserting into the database within a single transaction, but the buffering does not entail delays bigger than 50 ms.",

abstract="Smart objects are now present in our everyday lives, and the Internet of Things is expanding both in number of devices and in volume of produced data. These devices are deployed in dynamic ecosystems, with spatial mobility constraints, intermittent network availability depending on many parameters (e.g. battery level or duty cycle), etc. To capture knowledge describing such evolving systems, open, shared and dynamic knowledge representations are required. These representations should also have the ability to adapt over time to the changing state of the world. That is why we propose IoT-O, a core-domain modular IoT ontology proposing a vocabulary to describe connected devices and their relation with their environment. First, existing IoT ontologies are described and compared to requirements an IoT ontology should be compliant with. Then, after a detailed description of its modules, IoT-O is instantiated in a home automation use case to illustrate how it supports the description of evolving systems.",

Therefore, for autonomous systems it will be necessary to extend the local view on the environment with external sensors, either fixed or mobile ones. New evolving technologies support the acquisition of a myriad of information, described as ``Internet of Things'', ``Intelligent Environments'', ``Industrial or Building Automation'', ``Ambient Intelligence'', or ``Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing'', etc. Thus, information is always available, but its interpretation and integration into the own view remains an open problem. We therefore propose the development of a new type of distributed middleware for the environmental perception, that abstracts the environment from the diversity of available sensor systems.

The first one is realized by means of semantic technologies and allows to generate more abstract information from raw sensor data by also considering knowledge about the environment. The second one is realized by means of Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis and allows to organize and classify abstract information, coming from the first phase, by generating a knowledge representation structure, namely lattice, that can be traversed to obtain information about occurring situation and augment human perception.

abstract="Certificateless signature cryptography is an efficient approach studied widely because it eliminates the need of certificate authority in public key infrastructure. There are number of security algorithms based on PKC (Public Key Cryptography), ID based certificate less schemes using bilinear maps assumptions. But implementation costs of these schemes are very high. On the other hand RSA is a scheme widely applied in real-life scenarios. So in this paper we proposed a RSA based certificate less signature scheme especially for wireless sensor networks. We have shown that this scheme is secure in random oracles model. A random oracles model is a way to proof the security of cryptographic algorithms which use hash functions and exponential operations in algorithms. Security of this scheme is closely related to discrete logarithm problem. Our scheme provide security against type I attack, type II attack, it also ensures integrity, non-repudiation and authentication.",

In order to advance the state-of-the-art, there is a demand for models that correlate mobile sensor data, health parameters, and situational and/or social environment. We seek to improve current models by combining environmental monitoring, personal data collecting, and predictive analytics. For that, we introduce a middleware called Device Nimbus that provides the structures to integrate data from sensors in existing mobile computing technology. Moreover, it includes the algorithms for context inference and recommendation support. This development leads to innovative solutions in continuous health monitoring, based on recommendations contextualised in the situation and social environment.

pages="535--550",
abstract="The use of Ambient-Assisted Living (AAL) systems has been spreading across several countries, with the ultimate purpose of improving the quality of life of patients. These systems often reflect complex architectures including several components such as sensors, gateways, Information Systems or even actuators, as well as messaging and transmitting protocols. Failures in these systems can have severe impact on a monitored patient, and most components foresee some kind of compensation countermeasures to increase reliability. Nevertheless, these measures are often self-contained to a single component and do not address the overall AAL system reliability, disregarding precedent and successor activities and interactions that exist for each time a certain value is registered or a certain alert is triggered. In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculate the overall reliability of an AAL system. We take a Business Process Management (BPM) approach to model the activities and interactions between AAL components, using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. By extending the BPMN standard to include reliability information, we can derive the overall reliability of a certain AAL system. To prove this approach, we also present a reliability study considering scenarios with single and pairwise reliability variations of AAL system components. With this approach, healthcare managers can benefit from important overall reliability information of an AAL system, and better allocate the appropriate resources (including hardware or health care professionals) to improve responsiveness of care to patients.",

abstract="There is increasing realisation that edge devices, which are closer to a user, can play an important part in supporting latency and privacy sensitive applications. Such devices have also continued to increase in capability over recent years, ranging in complexity from embedded resources (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards) placed alongside data capture devices to more complex ``micro data centres''. Using such resources, a user is able to carry out task execution and data storage in proximity to their location, often making use of computing resources that can have varying ownership and access rights. Increasing performance requirements for stream processing applications (for instance), which incur delays between the client and the cloud have led to newer models of computation, which requires an application workflow to be split across data centre and edge resource capabilities. With recent emergence of edge/fog computing it has become possible to migrate services to micro-data centres and to address the performance limitations of traditional (centralised data centre) cloud based applications. Such migration can be represented as a cost function that involves incentives for micro-data centres to host services with associated quality of services and experience. Business models need to be developed for creating an open edge cloud environment where micro-data centres have the right incentives to support service hosting, and for large scale data centre operators to outsource service execution to such micro data centres. We describe potential revenue models for micro-data centers to support service migration and serve incoming requests for edge based applications. We present several cost models which involve combined use of edge devices and centralised data centres.",

abstract="With the rapid development of wireless sensor network, cloud computing and Internet of Things, the problems of security and privacy are becoming more and more serious. Elliptic curve cryptography as a public key cryptography plays an important role to solve the security issues, in which scalar multiplication is the most important and time-consuming operation. Koblitz curve is a special class of elliptic curve over binary field, Frobenius endomorphism can be used to accelerate the scalar multiplication. By converting single scalar multiplication into simultaneous multiple scalar multiplication, GLV method can use Straus-Shamir trick to calculate the scalar multiplication. In this paper, we combine the idea of Frobenius endomorphism and GLV method to speed up the scalar multiplication on Koblitz curve. Our algorithm can efficiently convert scalar multiplication into multi-scalar multiplication to reduce the cost of point additions and Frobenius operations. Theoretical analysis results show that: Compared with                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}                                                                  $\tau$                                                            -and-add algorithm, our 2-dimensional implementation provides a speedup over 19{\%}, 3-dimensional implementation speeds up over 29{\%}. Finally, a parallel scalar multiplication algorithm for Koblitz curve is designed, which can flexibly select the dimension of the parallel algorithm based on the number r of processing unit.

abstract="The day-to-day experiences of aging citizens differ significantly from young, technologically savvy engineers. Yet, well-meaning engineers continue to design technologies for aging citizens, informed by skewed stereotypes of aging without deep engagements from these users. This paper describes a co-design project based on the principles of Participatory Design that sought to provide aging people with the capacity to co-design technologies that suit their needs. The project combined the design intuitions of both participants and designers, on equal footing, to produce a companion robot in the form of a networked robotic dog. Besides evaluating a productive approach that empowers aging people in the process of co-designing and evaluating technologies for themselves, this paper presents a viable solution that is playful and meaningful to these elderly people; capable of enhancing their independence, social agency and well-being.",

abstract="This paper proposes using a commodity-based smartwatch paired with a smartphone for developing a fall detection IoT application which is non-invasive and privacy preserving. The majority of current fall detection applications require specially designed hardware and software which make them expensive and inaccessible to the general public. We demonstrated that by collecting accelerometer data from a smartwatch and processing those data in a paired smartphone, it is possible to reliability detect (93.8{\%} accuracy) whether a person has encountered a fall in real-time. By wearing a smartwatch as a piece of jewelry, the well-being of a person can be monitored in real-time at anytime and anywhere as contrasted to being confined in a particular facility installed with special sensors and cameras. Using simulated fall data acquired from volunteers, we trained a fall detection model off-line that can be composed with a data collection accessor to continuously analyze accelerometer data gathered from a smartwatch to detect minor or serious fall at anytime and anywhere. The accessor-based architecture allows easy composition of the fall-detection IoT application tailored to heterogeneity of devices and variation of user's need.",

abstract="A smart toy is defined as a device consisting of a physical toy component that connects to one or more toy computing services to facilitate gameplay in the Cloud through networking and sensory technologies to enhance the functionality of a traditional toy. A smart toy in this context can be effectively considered an Internet of Things (IoT) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) which can provide Augmented Reality (AR) experiences to users. Referring to the direction of the United States Federal Trade Commission Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the European Union Data Protection Directive (EUDPD), this study adopts the definition of a child to be an individual under the age of 13 years old. In this study, the first assumption is that children do not understand the concept of privacy. The second assumption is that children will disclose as much information to smart toys as they can trust. Breaches of privacy can result in physical safety of child user, e.g., child predators. While the parents/legal guardians of a child strive to ensure their child's physical and online safety and privacy, there is no common approach for these parents/guardians to study the information flow between their child and the smart toys they interact with. This paper discusses related privacy requirements for smart toys in a toy computing environment with a case study on a commercial smart toy called Hello Barbie from Mattel.",

abstract="A wireless sensor network is one popular candidate for the fundamental backbone of IoT (Internet of Things). Among the key technologies involved in wireless sensor networks, fault detection techniques are indispensable for maintaining the availability of sensor applications. To employ a distributed fault detection scheme, we address a generalized data inconsistency detection model and apply it to recognize data inconsistencies within a wireless sensor network. Then, we formally prove that data inconsistencies can be correctly recognized under the requisite conditions, and we evaluate the robustness of the generalized data inconsistency detection under the probability fault model. Our numerical result indicates that the degree of robustness eventually approaches to 1 if the node reliability is greater than 0.5. Moreover, we show that the tolerable defect rate of the generalized data inconsistency detection is strictly less than                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            1                      2                                                                    , so its defect-free rate must be greater than                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            1                      2                                                                    .

With the advent of Cyber Physical Systems, where big data is collected from heterogeneous sensors and other data sources, finding a suitable normalization technique is also a challenge to enable data fusion (integration). Therefore, data fusion and aggregation of criteria are similar processes of combining values either from criteria or from sensors to obtain a common score. In this study, our aim is to discuss metrics for assessing which are the most appropriate normalization techniques in decision problems, specifically for the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) multi-criteria method. AHP uses a pairwise approach to evaluate the alternatives regarding a set of criteria and then fuses (aggregation) the evaluations to determine the final ratings (scores).",

Therefore, outsourcing sensed data from smart home to the cloud is raising serious privacy concerns. In particular, when untrusted third party cloud services are accessing personal identifiable information (PII) beyond their collection purpose. One privacy preserving approach consists of encrypting the data, before it is outsourced to the cloud, according to user settings.

abstract="In this paper we present the open health monitoring platform SmartAssist, which combines flexible in-home and mobile sensing features with a comprehensive social network that is designed to enhance communication between caretakers, caregivers and the community. SmartAssist supports the integration of new sensor types, algorithms, and mobile components through an integrated platform, which consists of an in-home sensor network; a web based service portal; and an extensible infrastructure for mobile devices. Through the adoption of open standards (Android, OSGi, OpenSocial, etc.), the system addresses issues of data protection and privacy, while simultaneously providing support for third-party extensions and context-aware services. In this paper, we will present the individual building blocks of the SmartAssist Platform as well as some illustrative example services.",

abstract="This paper argues that there is a need for an awareness and education about privacy literacy in an age where lifelogging technologies are ubiquitous and open up private data to commercial and other uses, wherein commercial entities build up huge digital libraries of private data that they then mine with big data analytics. Often, data is represented as if they are the raw material of information and algorithms, and as neutral agents for processing these pieces of information, but in our digital society, this so-called neutral data can become open data that can be processed easily to reveal informational metadata on individuals' behaviors. Whilst much of this may be beyond individual control, and simply an unavoidable part of our information society, there are certain types of personal and private data that can be, and need to be, under individual control, and not open to integration or `hashing' with public data. This requires a new type of data literacy on the part of users that we term as privacy literacy.",

abstract="Sensor networks have evolved rapidly in recent years from purpose built technology specific deployments to the stage where they are now able to deliver information through commodity communications channels. In parallel, pressures on the environment and resources have made the range of such purposes much wider and sensor input is necessary for sustainability of society's functions and infrastructure. The sensor network is becoming a part of critical network infrastructure and, in the same ways as other supporting technologies, must satisfy requirements for resilience, security and interoperability. This paper takes stock of requirements and solutions to highlight the opportunities and potential threats that follow from these trends. It reports on current work in CENELEC on a framework for addressing these issues.",

abstract="In diverse sectors companies collaborate to offer integrated user-centric services to obtain competitive advantage. However, regarding elderly care, services are typically isolated, and mostly provided by a single provider. Moreover, there is a need to personalize services in respect of the individuality of each senior and making these services evolve according to the lifestyle and necessities of the person. In this context, the concept of Elderly Care Ecosystem (ECE) emerges as a computer-based collaborative environment that promotes the integration of distinct services and providers. ECEs are complex systems that demand a clear description of their requirements, especially of those related to personalization of services. In this paper, we describe a set of core requirements and challenges for designing personalized services in an elderly care ecosystem. In particular, our contributions are: the identification of the main stakeholders of an ECE, the requirements to build a persona profile in ECE, and a reference requirements model based on i* for service personalization in ECE.",

Users frequently report difficulties in reading the material, finding the required information and understanding the technical jargon, and/or have lost the sheet. The purpose of this study was to assess the participants' needs and major difficulties in using a medicine paper fact sheet, as well as their acceptance of a digital solution. Two focus groups sessions were conducted on a sample of 15 participants, divided into three groups (young adults, middle-aged adults, young-older adults). Differences among groups were found for difficulties with the paper version and the expectations regarding the digital version. Findings suggest that digital fact sheet may serve as a positive solution, but is mostly seen by the participants as a complement of the paper version.",

abstract="Communication technologies have revolutionized modern society. They have changed the way we do business, travel, manage our personal lives and communicate with our friends. In many cases, this crucially depends on accurate and reliable authentication. We need to get authenticated in order to get access to restricted services and/or places (i.e. transport systems, e-banking, border control). This authentication is performed in constrained settings due to: (i) privacy issues, (ii) noisy conditions, (iii) resource constraints. Privacy-preservation is essential for the protection of sensitive information (i.e. diseases, location, nationality). Noisy conditions refer to physical noise in the communication channel that may lead to modification of the transmitted information, or natural variability due to the authentication medium (e.g. fingerprint scans). Resource constraints refer to limited device power/abilities (i.e. sensors, RFID tags). It is a very challenging problem to develop privacy-preserving authentication for noisy and constrained environments that optimally balance authentication accuracy, privacy-preservation and resource consumption. In this paper, we describe the main challenges of the problem of authentication in constrained settings, the current state-of-the-art of the field and possible directions of research.",

The results of the statistics show that the share of seniors in the Czech Republic has an increasing trend. The utilization of social networks by elderly people has in the Czech Republic also increasing trend except for the second quarter of the 2015 year when a slight decrease was recorded. In comparison with other countries from Visegrad group and the EU 28 the Czech Republic reached lower results in the utilization of social networks. In two evaluated criteria from three the Czech Republic was comparable to Poland. The age groups show that with increasing age there is a declining trend for the use of social networks. 10.1{\%} of the population from 55 to 64 years and 3.3{\%} of the population over 65 use social networks in the second quarter of 2015.

abstract="IoT enabled smart environments typically include large number of simple sensors that are designed to detect specific events. In many environments, however, not one but combinations of sensor events represent activities of interest (such as activities of daily living of a patient in a smarthome). Detecting and monitoring these activities of interest result in both application-specific benefits and operational benefits. However, human activities often overlap, thereby making activity detection from the collected sensor events a challenging problem. In this paper, we first present the various benefits of such materialization of sensor events into activities, and then discuss the challenges in detecting diverse activities taken up by humans. More interestingly, the diversity of human activities and the time-variability of a given activity by the same human, makes reliable detection of activities even harder, and open up interesting avenues for future research.",

abstract="Patient's motion recognition is quite popular in the area of healthcare and medical service nowadays. By analyzing the data from variant sensors within the network, we can estimate the activities a person does. The analyzing job is usually done by a classifier which can classify each motion into one category with similar movements. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a kind of algorithm that can be used to arrange data into different categories without any guidance. Decision tree is a mature tool for classification. In this paper, we propose a new kind of classification method with data from BAN called SOM-Decision Tree. Firstly, we use SOM on each of the sensor nodes to categorize motions into different classes, so that motions in different classes can be distinguished by this sensor. Secondly, a decision tree is constructed to discriminate each kind of movements from other motions. Finally, any action of the same patient can be recognized by query through the decision tree. According to our experiment, this algorithm is feasible and quite efficient.",

In this paper, we apply leading privacy models to the results of qualitative research in which we solicited ideas for adding intelligence to homes and buildings, paying particular attention to information sensitivity about everyday activities that take place in those settings. We identify locations and activities that are particularly information-sharing sensitive, prioritize the salience of different types of privacy violations for householders and workers, and examine the influence of privacy attitudes on smart device ownership and desired future smart experiences.",

abstract="The increase of ICT infrastructure in hospitals offer opportunities for cost reduction by optimizing workflows, while maintaining quality of care. This work-in-progress poster details the AORTA system, which is a semantic platform to optimize transportation task scheduling and execution in hospitals. It provides a dynamic scheduler with an up-to-date view about the current context by performing semantic reasoning on the information provided by the available software tools and smart devices. Additionally, it learns semantic rules based on historical data in order to avoid future delays in transportation time.",

abstract="This paper presents a rule-based approach for both offline and real-time recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL), leveraging events produced by a non-intrusive multi-modal sensor infrastructure deployed in a residential environment. Novel aspects of the approach include: the ability to recognise arbitrary scenarios of complex activities using bottom-up multi-level reasoning, starting from sensor events at the lowest level; an effective heuristics-based method for distinguishing between actual and ghost images in video data; and a highly accurate indoor localisation approach that fuses different sources of location information. The proposed approach is implemented as a rule-based system using Jess and is evaluated using data collected in a smart home environment. Experimental results show high levels of accuracy and performance, proving the effectiveness of the approach in real world setups.",

A computational awareness of context can improve the speed and accuracy of complex data analysis, and promote more effective human-machine collaboration. We describe ongoing work to develop a framework that monitors human-machine interactions, analyzes context, and augments the system (such as prioritizing information, providing recommendations, adapting an interface, adjusting the level of automation, proactively fetching data, managing notifications, sharing context with others, personalizing the system, etc.). We believe that we can facilitate complex data analysis by adapting systems to meet analysts needs based upon the varying demands of the tasks, priorities, resources, time, user state, and environment.",

abstract="This paper studies the design of information systems that leverage the use of both sensors and the social web, while addressing solutions for children in socially challenging situations. Socially challenging situations are defined as situations in which one experiences negative social pressure and, therefore, requires immediate help from trusted people. The authors first provide a glimpse into the rapid development in sensors and the rise in the importance of the social web. The paper then sheds light on the theme of socially challenging situations, which is elaborated through two workshops, and defines the core areas of focus. Further, a low-fidelity prototype for the safety of children is created and evaluated in a small-scale user experiment. The state of the current technology is then reviewed in order to visualize the possible practical realization of solutions. The outcomes of these steps provide interesting insights for possible future work.",

This is a programmatic paper that seeks to elaborate foundational challenges that face HDI from an interactional perspective. It is rooted in and reflects foundational lessons from social studies of science that have had a formative impact on CSCW, and core challenges involved in supporting interaction/collaboration from within the field of CSCW itself. These are drawn upon to elaborate the inherently social and relational character of data and the challenges this poses for the ongoing development of HDI, particularly with respect to the `articulation' of personal data. Our aim in doing this is not to present solutions to the challenges of HDI but to articulate core problems that confront this fledgling field as it moves from nascent concept to find a place in the interactional milieu of everyday life and particular research challenges that accompany it.",

abstract="The Smart City is by now a model for the application of Future Internet services and infrastructure towards radical improvements of urban services in terms of efficiency and sustainability. In recent experiences in this area, however, a new vision is emerging that enriches the original concept with the human perspective, as gained through the application of citizen-centric and participatory approaches to the co-design and development of Smart City services. Indeed, it is becoming clear that ``smartness'' alone---sensors, metres, infrastructures---risks placing the citizen outside of the process, as a user who never takes the kind of ownership of the services that can only be ensured by engagement in their co-design from the very start. This paper explores the emergent model for Human Smart Cities, its methodological components, and the ``softer'' features of ``smartness''---such as clarity of vision, citizen empowerment, participation, etc.---which can complement the technological drive of the underlying urban infrastructure. Conclusions are set out in terms of implications and potential for EU policy renewal in the context of Europe 2020.",

Then we use the martingale limit theory to prove the asymptotic independence of this heterogeneous work stealing model. Finally, we analyze and compute the fixed point, which can give performance analysis of this heterogeneous stealing model.",

This paper presents a prosumer tool called DataQuest to gather and analyze data from an AmI platform based on ontologies using simple services. An empirical study was carried out in order to demonstrate that, based on the defined prosumer model; a domain expert can create services with acceptable quality for a given domain. The authors performed a case study where 24 people used the prosumer tool to create simple services over a prosumer infrastructure for retrieving and analyzing data from a semantic AmI platform; the aim of this study consists of analyzing the quality of the services built and studying the effort needed to build prosumer services compared with traditional development.",

We review the existing literature on agency and propose a definition of agency that is practical for describing the capabilities and impact human and machine actors may have in a human-machine network. On this basis, we discuss and demonstrate the impact and trust implications for machine actors in human-machine networks for emergency decision support, healthcare and future smart homes.

Technology becomes further more competent than the subject in dialoguing with the situational environment, both in the area of information building (search engines) and of location-based dialogue with the daily environment (IoT, NFC, VR). Because of reduced physical distances and the growth in competence of technology, the free-choice based subject's responsibility, which initially appeared `augmented', in reality decreases and becomes an illusion, quite as the cubism illusionism of Braque and Picasso painting. Indeed, in this frame of work, responsibility appears to shift from the augmented individual to organisations and institutions managing technology with competence, within a frame of a digital technology Corporate Social Responsibility.",

abstract="Testbeds and experimental network facilities accelerate the expansion of disruptive Internet services and support their evolution. The integration of IoT technologies in the context of Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) and their deployment in federated, real--world testbeds introduce various challenging research issues. This paper presents the Semantic Aggregate Manager (SAM) that exploits semantic technologies for modeling and managing resources of federated IoT Testbeds. SAM introduces new semantics--based features tailored to the needs of IoT enabled UxVs, but on the same time allows the compatibility with existing legacy, ``de facto'' standardised protocols, currently utilized by multiple federated testbed management systems. The proposed framework is currently being deployed in order to be evaluated in real--world testbeds across several sites in Europe.",

abstract="Socially intelligent virtual agents are a promising solution to the increasing challenges of eldercare. This article describes an autonomous conversational agent system, simulating human-like affective behaviour to act as a daily life companion for older adults living at home. We present results from a user-centred design study that informed the design of the companion. The interaction with the user is based on a multimodal interface including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a graphical touch-based user interface. The companion offers support to older adults by locating objects, offering reminders, and guidance with household activities. It also supports emergency detection and handling. We present the companion's architecture and key components as well as the affective interaction paradigm and its implementation in the multimodal user interface. We conducted an exploratory evaluation study where the companion was introduced in 20 homes of older adults (aged 65+) in two EU countries. For a total duration of 12 weeks, various scenarios were tested, covering different types of interactions and tasks that occur in daily life. Qualitative and quantitative data on acceptance, perceived usability, and usefulness yield rich information on how agents perform in real-world settings and which factors influence their success in this context. We reflect on the results of the evaluation study in terms of lessons learned and discuss future opportunities for fellow researchers who are striving to bring virtual agents out of the laboratories into successful real world applications.",

abstract="Shared ledger technologies, as exemplified by Blockchain, provide a new framework for supporting business collaborations that is based on having a high-reliability, shared, trusted, privacy-preserving, nonrepudiable data repository that includes programmable logic in the form of ``smart contracts''. The framework has the potential to dramatically transform business collaboration across numerous industry sectors, including finance, supply chain, food production, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare. Widespread adoption of this technology will be accelerated by the development of business-level languages for specifying smart contracts. This paper proposes that data-aware business processes, and in particular the Business Artifact paradigm, can provide a robust basis for a shared ledger Business Collaboration Language (BCL). The fundamental rationale for adopting data-aware processes is that shared ledgers focus on both data and process in equal measure. The paper examines potential advantages of the artifact-based approach from two perspectives: conceptual modeling, and opportunities for formal reasoning (verification). Broad research challenges for the development, understanding, and usage of a shared ledger BCL are highlighted.",

abstract="Nowadays, usage of the internet-of-things and oftenest of mobile phones, the technology, and networks of sensors has led to a huge and sudden increase in the amount of data commonly available in a streaming fashion. Online learning plays a vital role in classification which paves way for adaptive learning algorithm. Online multi-class imbalanced learning is a virgin problem that coalesces to the disputes of both online learning and multi-class imbalance learning. Sometimes the data streams for many applications like disease diagnosis, fraud detection, etc., may result in skewed class distribution. Many works in the literature are focused on online class imbalance learning with two-class problem. In this paper, a novel approach of EMOOB and EMUOB algorithms was proposed that overcome multi-class imbalance problem, where data comes in an online fashion. A comprehensive analysis was made in terms of class imbalance status, data distributions, imbalance rate, and in the performance of classifier. Based on the comprehension gained, two new ensemble methods EMOOB and EMUOB with adaptive weights are proposed in the name of WEOB.",

abstract="Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally and the second most common cause of avoidable visual impairment. It also holds a record in noncompliance to therapy from the patients in up to 50{\%} of the subjects treated with anti-glaucoma eye drops. LiveCity e-Health is a European research program, which aims to provide better treatment and follow up of glaucoma patients at their home, through telemonitoring with high definition video-to-video (v2v) communication from the University Hospital. Secondly, it aims to reduce the cost of health and improve the city environment by decreasing the number of visits to the Hospital. For this purpose, a software application has been developed; the latter is easy to use for elderly people at home, and capable of keeping the medical history and digital records of every patient in the Glaucoma Department. In addition, a specific web camera with snapshot ability of high quality photo of the eye has utilised. Two patients have been initially enrolled in the study and the preliminary results are so presented.",

abstract="[Context/Background]: With the increasing use of cyber-physical systems in complex socio-technical setups, mechanisms that hold specific entities accountable for safety and security incidents are needed. Although there exist models that try to capture and formalize accountability concepts, many of these lack practical implementations. We hence know little about how accountability mechanisms work in practice and how specific entities could be held responsible for incidents. [Goal]: As a step towards the practical implementation of providing accountability, this systematic mapping study investigates existing implementations of accountability concepts with the goal to (1) identify a common definition of accountability and (2) identify the general trend of practical research. [Method]: To survey the literature for existing implementations, we conducted a systematic mapping study. [Results]: We thus contribute by providing a systematic overview of current accountability realizations and requirements for future accountability approaches. [Conclusions]: We find that existing practical accountability research lacks a common definition of accountability in the first place. The research field seems rather scattered with no generally accepted architecture and/or set of requirements. While most accountability implementations focus on privacy and security, no safety-related approaches seem to exist. Furthermore, we did not find excessive references to relevant and related concepts such as reasoning, log analysis and causality.",

abstract="Fuzz testing is an established technique in order to find zero-day-vulnerabilities by stimulating a system under test with invalid or unexpected input data. However, fuzzing techniques still generate far more test cases than can be executed. Therefore, different kinds of risk-based testing approaches are used for test case identification, selection and prioritization. In contrast to many approaches that require manual risk analysis, such as fault tree analysis, failure mode and effect analysis, and the CORAS method, we propose an automated approach that takes advantage of an already shown correlation between interface complexity and error proneness. Since fuzzing is a negative testing approach, we propose a complexity metric for the negative input space that measures the boundaries of the negative input space of primitive types and complex data types. Based on this metric, the assumed most error prone interfaces are selected and used as a starting point for fuzz test case generation. This paper presents work in progress.",

abstract="We present and evaluate a microcontroller-optimized limited-memory implementation of a Warping Longest Common Subsequence algorithm (WarpingLCSS). It permits to spot patterns within noisy sensor data in real-time in resource constrained sensor nodes. It allows variability in the sensed system dynamics through warping; it uses only integer operations; it can be applied to various sensor modalities; and it is suitable for embedded training to recognize new patterns. We illustrate the method on 3 applications from wearable sensing and activity recognition using 3 sensor modalities: spotting the QRS complex in ECG, recognizing gestures in everyday life, and analyzing beach volleyball. We implemented the system on a low-power 8-bit AVR wireless node and a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller. Up to 67 or 140 10-second gestures can be recognized simultaneously in real-time from a 10Hz motion sensor on the AVR and M4 using 8mW and 10mW respectively. A single gesture spotter uses as few as 135$\mu$W on the AVR. The method allows low data rate distributed in-network recognition and we show a 100 fold data rate reduction in a complex activity recognition scenario. The versatility and low complexity of the method makes it well suited as a generic pattern recognition method and could be implemented as part of sensor front-ends.",

abstract="For impaired people, the conduction of certain daily life activities is problematic due to motoric and cognitive handicaps. For that reason, assistive agents in ambient assisted environments provide services that aim at supporting elderly and impaired people. However, these agents act in complex stochastic and indeterministic environments where the concrete effects of a performed action are usually unknown at design time. Furthermore, they have to perform varying tasks according to the user's context and needs, wherefore an agent has to be flexible and able to recognize required capabilities in a certain situation in order to provide adequate, unobtrusive assistance. Hence, an expressive representation framework is required that relates user-specific impairments to required agent capabilities. This work presents an approach which (a) describes and links user impairments and capabilities using the formal, model-theoretic semantics expressed in OWL2 DL ontologies, (b) computes optimal policies through Reinforcement Learning and propagates these in an agent network. The presented approach improves the collaborative, personalized and adequate assistance of assistive agents and tailors the agent-based services to the user's missing capabilities.",

We also draw parallels between loneliness interventions based on social innovation and the emerging `sharing economy' in the digital world and discuss the role of third paradigm of HCI research in this area.",

Though most of the issues at protocol and device level remain solved for Wireless Sensor Networks, there is a growing trend in integration of sensors and sensor based systems with Cyber Physical Systems, Machine-to-Machine and Device-to-Device communication both in infrastructure and ad-hoc modes. The emergence of Cloud Computing, highly intelligent 'Smart' devices and efforts towards 5th Generation telecom systems is expected to lead the revolution of a networked world with increased demand for situational awareness leading proliferation of sensors at the edge of physical world. Mounting intelligence built in 'smart' devices, scarcity of frequency spectrum, disruptive technologies and limitations on further reduction in base station size may render base station centric-architecture of today's wireless networks old-fashioned. Due to low data rate bursty nature of sensor data, massive-MIMO antennas, device-centric architectures, smarter devices and native support for Machine-to-Machine and Device-to-Device communication, sensor data originating from these systems and disruptive technologies is expected to grow manifold through passing years. Communication and network engineers face an emerging challenge of designing communication and network protocols that can efficiently get integrated with the emerging wireless cellular and computing paradigms.

Consequently, context-awareness makes a significant difference to mobile HCI. However, the challenges brought by context-awareness to users of mobile devices are rarely examined in depth. In this paper, previous conceptions of context and their contribution to context-awareness in mobile HCI is scrutinized and a preliminary context-computer interaction (CCI) model is advanced to illustrate the interaction characterized by mobile context-awareness. Furthermore, the paper examines the limitations of information processing models and review alternative models of context. We also address user experience challenges related to the enablement of mobile context-awareness and highlight avenues for future research issues. Specifically, we found that context-awareness has been employed broadly in developing applications and services on mobile platform, has had a huge impact on mobile user experience, and has altered the interaction between humans and computers by giving the latter a more active role to play. The significance of context-awareness in the usage of mobile systems calls for systematic and in-depth appreciation of its impact on mobile HCI.",

abstract="Ubiquitous computing, where computers `disappear' and instead sensor-enabled and software-controlled devices assist us in everyday tasks, has become an established trend. To ensure the safety and reliability of software embedded in these devices, rigorous model-based design methodologies are called for. Quantitative verification, a powerful technique for analysing system models against quantitative properties such as ``the probability of a data packet being delivered within 1ms to a nearby Bluetooth device is at least 0.98'', has proved useful by detecting and correcting flaws in a number of ubiquitous computing applications. In this paper, we focus on three key aspects of ubiquitous computing: autonomous behaviour, constrained resources and adaptiveness. We summarise recent advances of quantitative verification in relation to these aspects, illustrating each with a case study analysed using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The paper concludes with an outline of future challenges that remain in this area.",

abstract="Software-intensive systems are often independently developed, operated, managed, and evolved. Progressively, communication networks enabled these independent systems to interact, yielding a new kind of complex system, i.e. a system that is itself composed of systems, the so-called System-of-Systems (SoS). By its very nature, SoS is evolutionarily developed and exhibits emergent behavior.",

abstract="Mobile devices have become for many the preferred way of interacting with the Internet, social media and the enterprise. However, mobile devices still do not have the computing power and battery life that will allow them to perform effectively over long periods of time or for executing applications that require extensive communication or computation, or low latency. Cyber-foraging is a technique to enable mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in single-hop proximity. This paper presents the preliminary results of a systematic literature review (SLR) on architectures that support cyber-foraging. The preliminary results show that this is an area with many opportunities for research that will enable cyber-foraging solutions to become widely adopted as a way to support the mobile applications of the present and the future.",

abstract="The proportion of elderly people over 65 years old has rapidly increased, and social costs related to aging population problems have grown globally. The governments want to reduce these social costs through advanced technologies. The physician or medical center evaluates health conditions from the reports of elderly people. However, self-reports are often inaccurate, and sometimes reports by family or caregivers can be more accurate. To solve these problems, an evaluated objective method based on sensor data is needed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven smart home system that uses web technologies for connecting sensors and actuators. The proposed system provides a method of monitoring elderly people's daily activities using commercial sensors to register recognizable activities easily. In addition, it controls actuators in the home by using user-defined rules and shows a summary of elderly people's activities to monitor them.",

abstract="Smart city provides various value-added services by collecting large-scale data from houses and infrastructures within a city. However, it takes a long time and man-hour and needs knowledge about big data processing for individual applications to use and process the large-scale raw data directly. To reduce the response time, we use the concept of materialized view of database, and materialized view to be as a service. And we propose materialized view to be as as service (MVaaS). In our proposition, a developer of an application can efficiently and dynamically use large-scale data from smart city by describing simple data specification without considering distributed processes and materialized views. In this paper, we design an architecture of MVaaS using MapReduce on Hadoop and HBase KVS. And we demonstrate the effectiveness of MVaaS through three case studies. If these services uses raw data, it needs enormous time of calculation and is not realistic.",

abstract="In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.",

However, current systems have serious problems in terms of privacy since attackers can track users by analyzing information captured from the network such as MAC addresses. In this situation, this work provides a practical solution to the privacy issue in indoor positioning systems. We propose the usage of pseudo-certificates issued by third-party authorities for anonymous auhentication of mobile devices. The proposed scheme provides privacy to users while providing governmental authorities the possibility to analyze the historical position of users when they are required.

abstract="Achieving an enhanced network lifetime is still an open issue in mobile ad hoc network. After years of research and invention, a robust technique to ascertain energy efficiency is yet to be explored especially to overcome an adverse effect of dynamic topology and selection of highly stabilized links during routing. Therefore, we present a very simple and cost-efficient middleware called as MEEM i.e. Middleware for Energy Efficiency in Mobile ad hoc network that offers an effective solution towards this problem. MEEM offers cost effectiveness by enabling the middleware to increase its scope of selection of stabilized routes based on formulating new multiple decision-making parameters e.g. Time for Route Termination, Time for Stable Routing, Frequency of Route Error, Reduction in Signal Attenuation, and Remnant Network Lifetime. The design of MEEM is carried out using quadratic approach thereby retaining parallel processing of an algorithm to enhance the communication performance of the mobile nodes. The outcome of the study was found to excel better results in comparison to frequently used routing protocol e.g. Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) with respect to energy consumption and algorithm processing time. The algorithm is found to be compliant of time and space complexity thereby results in cost effective solution.",

abstract="Next-generation networks are witnessing a convergence of wired and wireless technologies towards a ubiquitous computing paradigm. Wireless Sensor Networks are leading this revolution, but their deployment is delayed mainly because of energy constraints. Sensor nodes are typically equipped with non-rechargeable batteries, thus energy consumption must be minimized. In this paper, an energy-efficient communication protocol, compliant with the ZigBee standard, is proposed and validated. In particular, a new algorithm is discussed that efficiently tunes the duty cycle of a node, i.e., the cycling between an awake and a sleep state of the radio transceiver. After a preliminary communication, each node knows the transmission times of its neighbors and thus when it can switch its radio off since it is not going to receive any message. The solution is robust and has low processing and storage capacity requirements. Simulation results have demonstrated substantial improvements in power consumption compared to the ZigBee standard.",

abstract="Security and privacy requirements in ubiquitous systems need a sophisticated policy language with features to express access restrictions and obligations. Ubiquitous systems involve multiple actors owning sensitive data concerning aspects such as location, discrete and continuous time, multiple roles that can be shared among actors or evolve over time. Policy consistency is an important problem in languages supporting these aspects. In this paper we present an abstract language (AAL) to specify most of these security and privacy features and compare it with XACML. We also classified the existing conflict detection mechanisms for XACML in dynamic, testing, or static detection. A thorough analysis of these mechanisms reveals that they have several weaknesses and they are not applicable in our context. We advocate for a classic approach using the notion of logical consistency to detect conflicts in AAL.",

abstract="We present the design and evaluation of Panoramic, a tool that enables end-users to specify and verify an important family of complex location events. Our approach aims to reduce or eliminate critical barriers to deployment of emerging location-aware business activity monitoring applications in domains like hospitals and office buildings. Panoramic does not require users to write code, understand complex models, perform elaborate demonstrations, generate test location traces, or blindly trust deterministic events. Instead, it allows end-users to specify and edit complex events with a visual language that embodies natural concepts of space and time. It also takes a novel approach to verification, in which events are extracted from historical sensor data traces and then presented with intelligible, hierarchical visualizations that represent uncertainty with probabilities. We build on our existing software for specifying and detecting events while enhancing it in non-trivial ways to facilitate event specification and verification. Our design is guided by a formative study with 12 non-programmers. We also use location traces from a building-scale radio frequency identification (RFID) deployment in a qualitative evaluation of Panoramic with 10 non-programmers. The results show that end-users can both understand and verify the behavior of complex location event specifications using Panoramic.",

Comfort preferences that are defined and stored on end-users mobile devices are subject to negotiations. The approach relies on a single trusted party operating as a public service in the ``security infrastructure as a service'' model. It is designed to assure resilience against attacks on users privacy from the side of service providers (SPs), user's attempts to use the services in an unauthorized manner, user's attempts to violate payment policies, as well as payment authority's attacks on privacy of users' payment patterns. From the SP perspective, the proposed approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized service usage, or denial of service attacks. All players benefit from the fast and secure micropayments allowing for pay-per-use model implementation, which is natural in ubiquitous services usage scenarios.",

abstract="In this paper, details are presented on how physical objects interact with conceptual models in Factory of the Future (FoF) scenarios. For this reason, a hierarchical three layer structure - for physical objects, models and concepts - is described as part of the Knowledge-based Robotics (KbR) approach. Focusing on the integration of physical objects and models, the need for service-driven enrichment emerges. Thereby, the extension of physical objects with cyber twins is realized for enabling service capabilities like monitoring and control. For their development, an architecture is introduced based on the integration of logical and physical components. This is validated in the OMiLAB environment using the OMiRob case. The conceptual approach proves the capability of applying service-driven enrichment to physical objects using metamodeling techniques.",

abstract="Various types and massive amounts of data are collected in multiple industries. The proliferation of data provides numerous opportunities to improve existing services and develop new ones. Although data utilization contributes to advancing service, studies on the design of new service concepts using data are rare. The present study proposes a data-driven approach to designing new service concepts. The proposed approach is aimed at helping service designers to understand customer behaviors and contexts through data analysis and then generate new service concepts efficiently on the basis of such understanding. A case using bus driving data is introduced to illustrate the process of the proposed approach. The proposed approach provides a basis for the systematic design of new service concepts by enabling efficient data analysis. It also holds the potential to create a synergetic effect if incorporated into existing approaches to designing new service concepts.",

abstract="The slow adoption of cloud computing by the industry has collapsed the initial expectations of everything shifting rapidly to the cloud. Big and complex services are either postponing their migration to the cloud, or have simply not considered it as an option. The real success is coming from small services which exploit the elasticity and availability of cloud resources to become available to hundreds and millions of users, many of which are using mobile devices. However, little or no progress has been made in developing new architectures that exploit the capabilities offered by cloud and mobile computing. In this paper, the cloud-enabled mobile devices concept is defined, making an overview of the related fields. People-as-a-Service is proposed as a new service model based on that concept, describing a high level architecture to support it, and presenting a business application based on this technology. As a result, cloud-enabled mobile devices promote the emergence of new scenarios and mobile applications based on new architectures where devices can act both as clients and servers.",

abstract="Currently, the problem of efficient gathering and analysis of heterogeneous data from public Internet sources is relevant to many companies working with social issues. Also it applies to the task of building a social profile for the subsequent person identification. This paper addresses the issues of direct and indirect identification a person on the Internet as well as data structure development to store the static and dynamic information of a personal social profile. The article considers the basic options of personal network identification such as an identification by profiling data, IDs, personal websites and blogs, accounts in social networks, e-mail addresses and links from other resources. After identifying it is necessary to collect and structure the detected data about a person. For this purpose, the authors proposed a basic data structure divided into static and dynamic parts. The static part is represented in the form of a relational database and contains immutable data that uniquely identify a specific human (for example, name and surname, completed educational institutions, career, curriculum vitae etc.). The dynamic part is organized as a NoSQL store and accumulates all the information about the current human activity in the network (for examples, accounts in social networks, network friends, current preferences when buying products, preferences when visiting network resources, political and social beliefs etc.).",

abstract="This paper presents the design of a wearable system to transform a helmet into a smart, multi-sensor connected helmet (SHelmet) to improve motorcycle safety. Low power design and self-sustainability are the key for the usability of our helmet, to avoid frequent battery recharges and dangerous power losses. Hidden in the helmet structure, the designed system is equipped with a dense sensor network including accelerometer, temperature, light, and alcohol gas level, in addition, a Bluetooth low energy module interfaces the device with an on-vehicle IR camera, and eventually the user's smart phone. To keep the driver focused, the user interface consists of a small non-invasive display combined with a speech recognition system. System architecture is optimized for aggressive power management, featuring an ultra-low power wake-up radio, and fine-grained software-controlled shutdown of all sensing, communication and computing sub-systems. Finally, a multi-source energy harvesting module (solar and kinetic) performs high-efficiency power recovery, improving battery management and achieving self-sustainability. SHelmet supports rich context awareness applications; breath alcohol control; real time vehicle data; sleep and fall detection; data display. Experimental results show that is possible achieve self-sustainability and demonstrate functionality of the developed node.",

abstract="Due to the rapid change in the residential style, about 70{\%} of the population of South Korea reside in multi-unit dwelling today. As many people share the same building as a residential area, the neighboring interlayer noise problem becomes a serious social problem leading to murder, arson attack, etc. However, it is practically impossible to improve the buildings or introduce new building technologies to ones already built to prevent the inter floor noise. When noise occurs, there are no appropriate system or laws for people to impose special sanctions on the perpetrator. Most solutions are either too long in terms of process or indirect. It is necessary to have a process, which solves the problem directly and continuously. The survey results, that targeted people living in apartment houses, show that perpetrators are not aware of the actions that cause noises. Not only that, results show both victim and noise attacker's lack of awareness of precise standards of interested noise. Above all, anyone living in the apartment houses can be a victim or a perpetrator of inter floor noise problem. Therefore, this study proposes a service in which the perpetrators can monitor, manage and supervise interlayer noises that they create. This service will help perpetrators be more keen to their own noise, ultimately preventing problems caused by interlayer noises. Through the service, it is expected that the number of victims suffering from the noise will be decreased and ultimately, the inter-floor noise complaint rate, which is increasing every year, will be reduced so it prevents neighbor's conflicts and disputes.",

abstract="Sociomateriality is gaining momentum and is by now characterized as a research stream in the information system field. Although some definitions emerged, there is still uncertainty about how to conceptually and analytically address sociomateriality. The debate ranges from understanding sociomateriality as just a fancy word for technology to treating it as a de-facto theory of the human-technology relationship. To bring the field forward, a common basic understanding of what sociomateriality entails is needed. In this paper we set out to contribute to such an understanding. We do this by conducting a systematic mapping study of emerging concepts and definitions in the current empirical body of literature on sociomateriality. Our analysis finds three key resulting facets: mutuality (what is a sociomaterial assemblage?), performativity (how does it perform?), and multidimensionality (When and where does it perform?). Our findings outline how sociomaterial studies analytically and methodologically address performativity spanning across time and space.",

For this, the need of real-time sensor data gains importance. The data collected from the physical objects should be easily available for different applications. Semantic representation of the sensor data directly addresses the problem of storing it in logical, easily accessible and extensible manner. Our paper works towards converting the already collected sensor data of the {\#}SmartME project into semantic format and also proposes real-time storage of semantically enriched sensor data. To build applications using these sensor data the authors consider mainly three kinds of sensors, i.e., Temperature, Humidity, Pressure. Predicting the observed value of any sensor data is the main aim of this work. The analysis leverages other sensors {\&} environmental parameters such as Date, Time, Longitude, Latitude, Altitude etc. Correlation among these parameters and the accuracy of the predicted results showed the suitability of our proposed idea.",

When there exists right information at right time it is possible to make effective decisions. This paper, proposes a C-IOB (Context-Information, Observation, Belief) hierarchical graphical structure model which signifies a causal relationship between low level context and high level context to reason about the customer and vendor context based beliefs. The proposed model provides accurate service with minimum computation and also reduces solution search space since the context information of a business entity is synthesized in the form of beliefs.

The Open Vote Network is suitable for boardroom elections and is written as a smart contract for Ethereum. Unlike previously proposed Blockchain e-voting protocols, this is the first implementation that does not rely on any trusted authority to compute the tally or to protect the voter's privacy. Instead, the Open Vote Network is a self-tallying protocol, and each voter is in control of the privacy of their own vote such that it can only be breached by a full collusion involving all other voters. The execution of the protocol is enforced using the consensus mechanism that also secures the Ethereum blockchain. We tested the implementation on Ethereum's official test network to demonstrate its feasibility. Also, we provide a financial and computational breakdown of its execution cost.",

A reference architecture (RA) can capitalize experiences and facilitate the gaining of the benefits, but might encounter challenges when trying to gain the benefits of BOLD. The objective of the research to evaluate the benefits and challenges of building IT systems using a RA. We do this by investigating cases of the utilization of a RA for Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD). Benefits of using the reference architecture include reducing project complexity, avoiding having to ``reinvent the wheel'', easing the analysis of a (complex) system, preserving knowledge (e.g. proven concepts and practices), mitigating multiple risks by reusing proven building blocks, and providing users a common understanding. Challenges encountered include the need for communication and learning the ins and outs of the RA, missing features, inflexibility to add new instances as well as integrating the RA with existing implementations, and the need for support for the RA from other stakeholders.",

abstract="Due to the demand for low-cost cryptosystems from industry, there spring up a lot of lightweight block ciphers which are excellent for some different implementation features. An innovative design is the block cipher PRINCE. To meet the requirement for low-latency and instantaneously encryption, NXP Semiconductors and its academic partners cooperate and design the low-latency block cipher PRINCE. Another good example is the block cipher LED which is very compact in hardware, and whose designers also aim to maintain a reasonable software performance. In this paper, we demonstrate how to achieve high software performance of these two ciphers on the AVR 8-bit microcontrollers using bitslice technique. Our bitsliced implementations speed up the execution of these two ciphers several times with less memory usage than previous work. In addition to these two nibble-oriented ciphers, we also evaluate the software performance of a newly proposed lightweight block cipher RECTANGLE, whose design takes bitslicing into consider. Our results show that RECTANGLE has very high ranks among the existing block ciphers on 8-bit microcontrollers in the real-world usage scenarios.",

abstract="As cities have become more sophisticated with the introduction of advanced information technology and with the widespread use of social media, there is a need to identify a middle ground (or connective mode) which links the operating systems of the city with its citizens. In order to develop a new viable model for Smart City operating systems, an in-depth understanding of key drivers of the city will be required. This process must simultaneously integrate both top-down and bottom-up data streams to allow operating systems to grow organically and sustainably, with the following goals: (1) Permit city leaders to make more informed decisions, (2) Create an open development environment that will encourage private enterprise to infuse capital, technology and innovative business solutions, (3) Allow citizens to participate in the operation and management of their communities. The primary objective of this paper is to define the required methodology to plan, design and implement appropriate solutions to City DNA through the use of an integrated ``Middle Ground'' approach.",

To address these problems, our paper proposes KSD - Knowledge Serializer and De-serializer tool, that takes an ontology as an input and represents it in a structured form (like JSON, XML) while preserving the underlying semantic information. This format is adaptable to the changes in the underlying ontology and can be used to create user interface, web services and other application modules.",

abstract="In hybrid energy harvesting sensor networks, there is a trade-off between the cost of data collection by a wireless sink and the timeliness of the collected data. The trade-off further depends on the energy harvesting capability of the sensor nodes as sensors cannot transmit data if they do not have sufficient energy. In this paper, we propose an analytic model for assessing the value of the information that a sensor node brings to decision making. We account for the timeliness of data by discounting the value of the information at the sensor over time and adopt the energy-chunk approach (i.e. discretise the energy level) to track energy harvesting and expenditure over time. Finally, by numerical experiments, we study the optimal data collection rate for the sensor node at hand.",

The CPG parameters of these motions are determined and compared to the given patterns to distinguish between tip-toe walking and normal walking.

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSN) emerge at the center of the fast expanding Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, and hence increased research efforts are being directed towards its efficient deployment, optimization and adaptive operation. Rapid deployment of WSN in an unknown open environment is a critical challenge that involves finding optimal locations for the network nodes to deliver optimally balanced sensing and communication services at the maximum possible coverage subject to complex mutual constraints. We address this challenge with a variant of the Voronoi-based algorithm that leverages the converged movement towards Voronoi cells' centers with the intelligent nodes' provisioning algorithm to deliver fully automated and autonomous WSN that rapidly self-deploys itself to any finite indoor environment without using any prior knowledge of the size and structure of the target space. Sequential provisioning supports realistic implementation that accounts for collision avoidance and mitigates the risk of wasteful over-deployment. The preliminary comparative simulation results carried out in a simplified environment indicate very fast convergence to the well balanced WSN at the fairly small deployment cost and thereby validate our model as a very promising compared to the previous approaches to WSN deployment.",

First, we construct a phantom area in order to make phantom source nodes being far from the real source node. Secondly, we combine shortest path routing and random routing to forward packets to sink node rather than deviating from sink node. Then, we make every packet pass through a special area called trace cost area which consists of many sensor nodes with different weights in different areas and finally reach the ring around sink node. Compared with SLP-E, which fails to take overlapping path into consideration, our proposed scheme can reduce overlapping path.

In order to improve the comprehensiveness covered both design and execution stages, a service composition approach based on process mining is proposed. First, a meta-model is designed to connect the information of execution environment and business requirement. Next, the scene model based on this meta-model is generated by leveraging process mining. Then the scene model is applied to do service composition, including service selection from the Service Registry.

abstract="Authentication is one of the most important technologies to protect the privacy and security of RFID systems. The EPCglobal Class-1 Gen-2 specification is an important standard for RFID. The tags conforming to this standard have limited computing and store resources, and no more attentions are paid to their security and privacy. So the application of these tags is not secure. But this kind of tags is considered as the main stream for RFID applications. In order to solve the secure problems for this kind of RFID tags we propose a lightweight authentication protocol based on CRC, which can assure forward security and prevent information leakage, location tracing, eavesdropping, DOS attack, replay attack, and spoofing. This protocol avoids CRC collision by reasonably dividing the tag's identification information into two different parts and it enhances the mutual authentication strength between tags and readers by dual authentications. This protocol only uses the computing resources embedded in tags and it is very suitable to low-cost RFID systems.",

The mortality in 2014 was 123.92/lakh, which was 4.4 times higher than in 2002. Cardiovascular disease is ranked No. 1 in cause of death in China right now, in both rural and urban areas. This paper presents a medical information sharing platform based on mobile Internet, cloud computing and big data mining. It is designed to support the PB-level data management and analysis, and millions of concurrent instant messaging. The platform has the following functions: intelligent transportation decision support based on FMC-D time, built-in medical communication unit, built-in medical information sharing unit and quality control system of PCI hospital interventional images. The platform is divided into two parts - medical unit terminals (including EMS terminal, non-PCI hospital terminal and PCI hospital terminal) and cloud computing server, in which data is exchanged via 3G/4G wireless networks. The system has the following characteristics: (1) Timeline, which is a collection of key nodes that describe the AMI patient care process, (2) Smart recommendation technology, for example recommending hospitals based on the distance, medical care ability, idle resource. (3) Capacity to support, such as large number of concurrent collaborative treatment process among multiple PCI hospitals, multi-non-PCI medical institutions, and multi-EMS institutions, as well as the PB level data which are generated in the process.",

abstract="The wide availability of high interconnection networks, powerful mobile devices and service-oriented architectures has paved the way for the delivery of cloud services. Moving information technology services to the cloud has imposed new ways of interaction with users. Users desire friendly looking, highly interactive, dynamically visualized and naturally controlled user interfaces (UI) that allow smooth navigation in the cloud space. Transferring the rich user interface of the desktop, where running the software dynamically online and instantly following up with social networking activities is relatively easy, to the web-browser on mobile devices is introducing many challenges. This has resulted in the emergence of innovative cloud services and implementation approaches specifically to handle the new user interface demands. However, a standardized consistent user interface metaphor for cloud services is still lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the cloud user interface requirements, special services, implementation trends, technologies and efforts for standardization.",

pages="280--298",
abstract="RDF stream processing (RSP) has become a vibrant area of research in the semantic web community. Recent advances have resulted in the development of several RSP engines that leverage semantics to facilitate reasoning over flows of incoming data. These engines vary greatly in terms of implemented query syntax, their evaluation and operational semantics, and in various performance dimensions. Existing benchmarks tackle particular aspects such as functional coverage, result correctness, or performance. None of them, however, assess RSP engine behavior comprehensively with respect to all these dimensions. In this paper, we introduce YABench, a novel benchmarking framework for RSP engines. YABench extends the concept of correctness checking and provides a flexible and comprehensive tool set to analyze and evaluate RSP engine behavior. It is highly configurable and provides quantifiable and reproducible results on correctness and performance characteristics. To validate our approach, we replicate results of the existing CSRBench benchmark with YABench. We then assess two well-established RSP engines, CQELS and C-SPARQL, through more comprehensive experiments. In particular, we measure precision, recall, performance, and scalability characteristics while varying throughput and query complexity. Finally, we discuss implications on the development of future stream processing engines and benchmarks.",

Our protocol uses dynamic time slots that will be assigned online to the nodes as needed. In our current architecture, a centralized coordinator directs the flow among the nodes by reconfiguring the local TDMA schedules. In the future, this protocol can be extended to fully enable reconfigurable flows in Networked Embedded Systems using a collection of decentralized controllers.",

The characteristics and categories of related electric appliances are established, and this system could search the corresponding cluster data and eliminates noise for recognition functionality and error detection mechanism of electric appliances by applying the current clustering algorithm.

abstract="Billions of interconnected neurons are the building block of the human brain. For each brain activity these neurons produce electrical signals or brain waves that can be obtained by the Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Due to the characteristics of EEG signals, recorded signals often contaminate with undesired physiological signals other than the cerebral signal that is referred to as the EEG artifacts such as the ocular or the muscle artifacts. Therefore, identification and handling of artifacts in the EEG signals in a proper way is becoming an important research area. This paper presents an automated EEG artifacts handling approach, combining Wavelet transform, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Hierarchical clustering. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been examined and observed on real EEG recording. According to the result, the proposed approach identified artifacts in the EEG signals effectively and after handling artifacts EEG signals showed acceptable considering visual inspection.",

Deploying these datasets in a third-party public cloud is a common solution for data sharing and processing. Maintaining data security in a public cloud is crucial. Here we target the data integrity issue, which is mainly achieved by hash operations. Existing hash schemes for graphs-structured data are either not suitable to all type of graphs or not computationally efficient for big graph. In this paper, we propose a secure, scalable hash scheme that is applicable to big graphs/trees, and its computation is highly efficient. We use the graph structure information to make our scheme unforgeable. Furthermore, we skillfully tune the scheme to make the graph verification and update processes very efficient. We will prove that our hash scheme is cryptographically secure. Our experimental results show that it has scalable computation performance.",

In this exploratory research based on a grounded theory approach, we developed a framework showing relationships between privacy awareness, hardware types, end-of-life handling, and data protection measures.

abstract="The Internet of Thing (IoT) has given rise to the integration of smart systems in the industrial, healthcare, and social environments. These smart systems are often implemented by system-on-chip (SoC) solutions that require power management units, sensors, signal processors, and wireless interfaces. Hence, an independent voltage reference circuit is crucial for obtaining accurate measurements from the sensors and for the proper operation of the SoC. Making, bandgap circuits indispensable in these types of applications. Typically, bandgap circuits are implemented using bipolar transistors to generate two voltages with opposite temperature coefficients (Complementary To Absolute Temperature -- CTAT; Proportional do Absolute Temperature - PTAT) which are added resulting in a temperature independent voltage reference. The disadvantage of using bipolar devices is that the power supply voltage must be larger than the ON base-emitter voltage, resulting in voltages larger than 0.7 V. The low power demands of IoT and of technology scaling, have forced lower values for the power supply voltage and thus new bandgap circuits using only CMOS transistors have gathered increased interest. In these, the MOS transistors operate in the weak inversion region where its current has an exponential relation with its gate-to-source voltage, as in the bipolar devices. Making it possible to generate both the PTAT and the CTAT voltages and thus produce a temperature independent voltage reference. This paper describes a design methodology of an all CMOS bandgap voltage reference circuit, in which one of the transistors works in the moderate region and the other in the weak inversion, to achieve the lowest possible voltage variation with temperature. The circuit produces a voltage reference of 0.45 V from a minimum power supply voltage of 0.6 V, with a total variation of 1.54 mV, over a temperature range of −40 to 100{\textdegree}C, resulting in a temperature coefficient of 24 ppm/{\textdegree}C, and a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of −40 dB.",

abstract="The ubiquity of sensor infrastructures in urban environments poses new challenges in managing the vast amount of data being generated and even more importantly, deriving insights that are relevant and actionable to its users and stakeholders. We argue that understanding the context in which people and things are connected and interacting is of key importance to this end. In this position paper, we present ongoing work in the design of a multiagent model based on immunity theory concepts with the scope of enhancing sensor-driven architectures with context-aware capabilities. We aim to demonstrate our approach in a real-world scenario for processing streams of sensor data in a smart building.",

abstract="A Mobile Social Networks (MSN) is a kind of opportunistic network, which is composed of numerous mobile nodes with social characteristic. By now, the prevalent community-based routing algorithms mainly choose the optimal social characteristic node to forward messages, however they rarely consider the effects of community distribution on mobile nodes and time-varying characteristics of network. These algorithms usually lead to a high consumption of network resources and a low successful delivery ratio if they are used directly in mobile social networks. In order to solve this problem, we build a time-varying community-based network model, and propose a community-aware message opportunistic transmission algorithm (CMOT) in this paper. For inter-community messages transmission, the CMOT chooses an optimal community path by comparing the community transmission probability. In local communities, messages are forwarded according to the encounter probability between nodes. The simulation results show that, in comparison with classical routing algorithms, such as PRoPHET, MaxProp, Spray and Wait, and CMTS, the CMOT can improve the successful delivery ratio of messages and reduce network overhead obviously.",

abstract="In this proposal an optimized system designed to help the greatest number of injured people in emergency situations is described, using the shortest possible time and cost. It is composed of a mobile application (assigned to medical staff and helpers), a web service and Near Field Communication wristbands assigned to victims. The mobile application is devoted to providing medical staff with the geolocation of victims as well as with an assistant indicating the best route to follow in order to take care of them based on the severity of their conditions and based on a triage method. Resolution of the routes is solved based on a classical problem, a Travelling Salesman Problem, using a k-partition algorithm to divide the huge number of victims in different clusters. Thus, each doctor has a specific area to assist victims. Besides, doctors can use a functionality of the application to contact their peers through a chat when additional help is needed. An IDentity-Based Signcryption is used for communication confidentiality, authenticity and integrity, both among peers, and between server and medical staff.",

abstract="A big challenge for Europe is the demographic shift towards an aging population. Resources in the health care sector are limited, so it is important that the seniors of tomorrow will be able to stay healthy and manage themselves as long as possible, preferably also with a good quality of life. Physical activity is very important both for mobility and for the general well-being, but it can be hard to find motivation to exercise alone at home. Also in rehabilitation there is a need for a more engaging approach than a sheet of paper describing exercises that should be performed. In the GameUp project we developed fun and motivational exergames particularly targeting elderly in a user centred approach. Physiotherapists ensured that the movements and exercises were good for flexibility, leg strength and balance. In addition to seven Kinect games, a walking app and a professional portal were developed. The Kinect games can be played in several levels, and those who are at risk of falling are able to play while seated. The professional portal ensures that the results of the project also can be used as a tool in rehabilitation. Test results from 20 elderly aged 65-95 as well as clinical trials of adherence to the exercises are encouraging, and the international and multidisciplinary team behind the project is now looking for ways to commercialize the project outcomes.",

In many scenarios, Hardware Security Modules such as the Trusted Computing Group's Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 are used as a security-anchor in embedded systems. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of TPM 2.0 for securing embedded systems and present a concept for advanced remote firmware upgrade of an embedded system with enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights and Privacy protection of device-resident data (i.e., data that remains on the device during the flashing process). This concept utilizes unique features of TPM 2.0. Furthermore, a prototypical implementation using a hardware TPM 2.0 and the TPM Software Stack 2.0 low-level System API is presented as a proof-of-concept.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Network in which nodes are mobile can be defined as MWSN (Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks). MWSNs are a budding field of research in contrast to their well-established ancestor. It consists of a variety of sensing elements deployed indiscriminately and at enormous scale. This can build a huge variety of redundant sensory information. Transmission of such redundant data saturates network resources and it additionally consumes nodes energy. Data aggregation is the process of reducing the amount of packets to be sent to sink to increase the life time of MWSN. Path and location of the nodes are changing frequently in mobile WSN. So Swarm intelligence (group behaviour) is needed for the communication as well as on data collection, Query publication and intrusion detection. To operate MWSNs in a secure way, intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network. Intrusion can also occur in multiple layers of MWSN so continuous investigation of aggregated data to be needed. Proposed work is for SIDI (Swarm Intelligence based Data aggregation for Intruder detection) raising the energy efficiency of a network. Simulation results indicate that this operation practically will increase the network lifetime.",

For the indoor environment of the test bed, the comfort index in winter recommended by ASHRAE Standard is applied. The nine types of lighting environment are configured, according to PWM and illuminance. Concerning the configured lighting environment, the PWM ratio is set as R:G:B = 1:1:1, R:G:B = 4:1:5, R:G:B = 8:7:7, and illuminance is set as 400 lx, 700 lx, 1000 lx. This study also analyzes the change of subject concentration levels through real time measurement of brainwaves, while the error search and correction is carried out in the suggested lighting environment. This was analyzed through relative SMR analysis. The experiment did not find significant differences in concentration levels resulting from the different lighting conditions.",

abstract="In a multi-party business process, the choreography defines the conversational protocol among the parties, so that the visibility of the parties' private processes is limited to the set of operations required to respect such a protocol. Especially in scenarios where physical resources are exchanged, knowing how a resource owned by a party is managed in the premises of another party is not possible. Thus, possible misalignments can be detected too late. At the same time, IoT is increasingly adopted to enact business processes in many domains: e.g., logistics, manufacturing, healthcare. As, with IoT, smart devices can physically flow through the different parties involved in a process, their sensing capabilities can be exploited to improve the process compliance checking. With this work we propose an approach for compliance checking that mixes commitments and smart devices. Commitments, declaratively defining mutual contractual relationships between parties, drive the configuration of smart devices that, flowing along with the process flow, check their satisfaction and, in case of misalignment, timely inform the involved parties.",
