abstract = "The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) has applications beyond clinical settings including in outpatient and care environments where monitoring is occurring over public networks and may involve non-dedicated devices. This poses a number of security and privacy challenges exacerbated by a heterogeneous and dynamic environment, but still requires standards for handling personally identifiable and medical information of patients and in some cases caregivers to be maintained. Whilst risk and threat assessments generally assume a stable and well-defined environment, this cannot be done in MIoT environments where devices may be added, removed, or changed in their configuration including connectivity to server back ends. Conducting a complete threat assessment for each such configuration changes is infeasible. In this paper, we seek to define a mechanism for prioritising MIoT threats and aspects of the analysis that are likely to be affected by composition and related alterations. We propose a mechanism based on the UK HMG IS11 approach and provide a case study in the form of the Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM)2 test bed.",

To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented to experimentally analyze and compare the resource efficiency of different SAT verification approaches in terms of a number of performance metrics, including computation and communication overhead.",

The big data generated by IoT devices in healthcare domain is analyzed on the cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computation resources of handheld devices. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT basedm-healthcare monitoring disease diagnosing framework is proposed which predicts the potential disease with its level of severity. Key terminologies are defined to generate user-oriented health measurements by exploring the concept of computational sciences. The architectural prototype for smart student healthcare is designed for application scenario. The results are computed after processing the health measurements in a specific context. In our case study, systematic student perspective health data is generated using UCI dataset and medical sensors to predict the student with different disease severity. Diagnosis schemes are applied using various state-of-the-art classification algorithms and the results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure.

A novel classifier or predicator equipped with a good feature selection function contributes effectively to classification and prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel bagging C4.5 algorithm based on wrapper feature selection, for the purpose of supporting wise clinical decision-making in the medical and healthcare fields. In particular, the new proposed sampling method, S-C4.5-SMOTE, is not only able to overcome the problem of data distortion, but also improves overall system performance because its mechanism aims at effectively reducing the data size without distortion, by keeping datasets balanced and technically smooth. This achievement directly supports the Wrapper method of effective feature selection without the need to consider the problem of huge amounts of data; this is a novel innovation in this work.",

These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

Conjoint analysis was adopted to estimate the relative importance of proposed attributes and preferences for service specifications. Data and medical history were collected from 435 respondents. The model was analyzed and compared between the groups with different medical histories, respectively. The results showed that potential users, in general, require a safe and trustworthy healthcare service, rather than greater functionality, while medical history has a considerable influence on the perceived importance of the proposed attributes.",

The aim is to ensure the security of patients’ healthcare data, realize access control for normal and emergency scenarios, and support smart deduplication to save the storage space in big data storage system. The medical files generated by the healthcare IoT network are encrypted and transferred to the storage system, which can be securely shared among the healthcare staff from different medical domains leveraging a cross-domain access control policy. The traditional access control technology allows the authorized data users to decrypt patient’s sensitive medical data, but also hampers the first-aid treatment when the patient’s life is threatened because the on-site first-aid personnel are not permitted to get patient’s historical medical data. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. In normal application, the healthcare staff with proper attribute secret keys can have the data access privilege; in emergency application, patient’s historical medical data can be recovered using a password-based break-glass access mechanism. To save the storage overhead in the big data storage system, a secure deduplication method is designed to eliminate the duplicate medical files with identical data, which may be encrypted with different access policies. A highlight of this smart secure deduplication method is that the remaining medical file after the deduplication can be accessed by all the data users authorized by the different original access policies. This smart healthcare big data storage system is formally proved secure, and extensive comparison and simulations demonstrate its efficiency.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

Even the simplest objects will become “smart” because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.",

We investigated whether pattern matching of QRS loops in the 3-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) will improve the grouping of patients whose space-time electrical activity akin to each other, thereby assisting in clinical decision making. First, pattern dissimilarity of VCG QRS loops is qualitatively measured and characterized among patients, resulting in a 93×93 distance matrix of patient-to-patient dissimilarity. Each patient is then represented as a node in the network (or a star in the galaxy), but node locations are optimized to preserve the dissimilarity matrix. The optimization is achieved with a self-organizing algorithm that iteratively minimizes the network energy. Experimental results showed that patients’ locations converge as the representation error reaches a stable phase. The convergence is independent of initial locations of network nodes. Most importantly, 93 patients are automatically organized into 3 clusters of healthy control, LBBB, and infarction. Spatial coordinates of nodes (or patients) are evidently novel predictors that can be used in the computer-assisted detection of cardiac disorders. Self-organizing pattern matching is shown to have strong potentials for large-scale unsupervised learning of patient groups.",

The symptoms of MBDs are almost similar to each other which makes it quite difficult to diagnose the specific disease. However, it is required to diagnose the patient for proper treatment and continuous monitoring of infected patients to control the infection of MBDs. Healthcare services based on fog-cloud assisted cyber-physical system are emerging as a proactive and efficacious solution to provide remote monitoring and early detection of infected users suffering from MBDs. Fog-cloud based cyber-physical system facilitates the alliance of devices in the physical space i.e. smart wearables, IoT sensors and smart cameras with cyber space to generate the required information. Afterwards, it uses cyber space to assimilate, analyze and share medical information amongst users and healthcare service providers. A novel system based on IoT sensors, cloud computing and fog computing is proposed to distinguish, classify and monitor the users infected with MBDs. The objective of this system is to control the outbreak of MBDs at an early stage. In the proposed system, similarity factor is calculated to differentiate among MBDs and then J48 decision tree classifier is used to classify the category of infection for each user. The alerts are instantly generated and sent on user’s mobile from fog layer in case of any abnormality. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used to sense the close proximity between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to monitor and represent the current state of the MBDs outbreak using close proximity data. The experimental evaluations of the proposed system resulted in high accuracy and low error rate to distinguish the MBDs and also provided 94% classification accuracy. The results also reveal that the TNA is an efficient tool to evaluate the state of MBDs outbreak using various statistical parameters.",

abstract = "The recent spectacular progress in the microelectronic, information, communication, material and sensor technologies created a big stimulus towards development of smart communicating cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT). CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the expansion of Internet technologies to include wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and smart objects by extensive interfacing of exclusively identifiable, distributed communication devices. Due to the close connection with the physical world, it is an important requirement for IoT technology to be self-secure in terms of a standard information security model components. Autonomic security should be considered as a critical priority and careful provisions must be taken in the design of dynamic techniques, architectures and self-sufficient frameworks for future IoT. Over the years, many researchers have proposed threat mitigation approaches for IoT and WSNs. This survey considers specific approaches requiring minimal human intervention and discusses them in relation to self-security. This survey addresses and brings together a broad range of ideas linked together by IoT, autonomy and security. More particularly, this paper looks at threat mitigation approaches in IoT using an autonomic taxonomy and finally sets down future directions.",

abstract = "Peer-assisted content delivery networks have recently emerged as an economically viable alternative to traditional content delivery approaches: the feasibility studies conducted for several large content providers suggested a remarkable potential of peer-assisted content delivery networks to reduce the burden of user requests on content delivery servers and several commercial peer-assisted deployments have been recently introduced. Yet there are many technical and commercial challenges which question the future of peer-assisted solutions in industrial settings. This includes among others unreliability of peer-to-peer networks, the lack of incentives for peers’ participation, and copyright issues. In this paper, we carefully review and systematize this ongoing debate around the future of peer-assisted networks and propose a novel taxonomy to characterize the research and industrial efforts in the area. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the last decade in the peer-assisted content delivery research and devise a novel taxonomy to characterize the identified challenges and the respective proposed solutions in the literature. Our survey includes a thorough review of the three very large scale feasibility studies conducted for BBC iPlayer, MSN Video and Conviva, five large commercial peer-assisted CDNs - Kankan, LiveSky, Akamai NetSession, Spotify, Tudou - and a vast scope of technical papers. We focus both on technical challenges in deploying peer-assisted solutions and also on non-technical challenges caused due to heterogeneity in user access patterns and distribution of resources among users as well as commercial feasibility related challenges attributed to the necessity of accounting for the interests and incentives of Internet Service Providers, End-Users and Content Providers. The results of our study suggest that many of technical challenges for implementing peer-assisted content delivery networks on an industrial scale have been already addressed in the literature, whereas a problem of finding economically viable solutions to incentivize participation in peer-assisted schemes remains an open issue to a large extent. Furthermore, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable expansion of conventional CDNs to a broader network of connected devices through machine to machine communication.",

abstract = "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more hybrid data is being collected by information systems, which are known as Hybrid Information Systems (HIS). Based on a new hybrid distance, novel Gaussian kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets (FRS) for HIS were constructed in our previous study. In real-world applications, with the deepening of cognition and improvements in technology, attribute values in an information system often evolve over time; in particular, there are three cases: when missing values are imputed, error values are corrected, and the values are coarsened or refined. This has posed challenges to developing efficient data analysis algorithms. In this paper, the changing mechanisms of the attribute values and fuzzy equivalence relations in FRS are analyzed. FRS approaches for incrementally updating approximations in HIS are presented. Moreover, two corresponding incremental algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experiments on eight data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an artificial data set show that incremental approaches can effectively improve the performance of updating approximations and not only significantly shorten the computational time, but also increase approximation classification accuracies.",

abstract = "Medical devices, in the case of malfunction, can have tangible impact on patient safety. Their security, in a world where the Internet of Things has become a reality, is paramount to the continued safety of patients that are dependent upon these devices. The international standard ISO/IEC 80001 – Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices presents a unified and amalgamated approach to the safety of medical devices connected to IT networks. Whilst this standard presents a guide for security and risk management in health delivery organisations, its effectiveness with regard to contemporary cybersecurity is unknown. This research employed a structured review process to compare and analyse the ISO/IEC 80001 technical controls standards (ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 and ISO/IEC 80001-2-8), with contemporary cybersecurity best practice, guidelines and standards. The research deconstructed the technical controls and drew links between these standards and cybersecurity best practice to assess the level of harmonisation. Subsequently, a deeper analysis identified the areas of omission, coverage, addition or improvement that may impact the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 80001 to provide effective cybersecurity protection. ISO/IEC 80001 aims to provide a minimal level of cybersecurity however this research demonstrates that there are deficiencies in the standard and identifies the important aspects of cybersecurity that could be improved. This situation has arisen due to the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment and the protracted time to revise and republish international standards. This research identified several areas that require urgent consideration, including Emergency Access, Health Data De-Identification, Physical Locks on Devices, Data Backup, Disaster Recovery, Third-Party Components in Product Lifecycle Roadmap, Transmission Confidentiality, and Transmission Integrity. The research will provide health delivery organisations implementing ISO/IEC 80001, assurance as to the level of protection supplied by the ISO/IEC 80001 standard, and the areas that may need enhancement to increase cybersecurity protection and consequently increase in patient safety. Further, the outcomes are expected to influence development of the related international standard, as the findings from this research are being provided to the International Organisations for Standardisation, TC215 Health Informatics, Joint Working Group 7, to inform the review of ISO/IEC 80001 currently in progress.",
