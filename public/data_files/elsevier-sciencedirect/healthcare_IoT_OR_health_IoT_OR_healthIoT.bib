abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

This data can be badly expressed, understood, and exploited by other systems and devices. Additionally, the huge amount of connected objects embeds with resource-constrained devices (sensors, actuators, RFIDS, etc.) are also challenging. Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology. The second contribution is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of this ontology. In fact, an IoT Medicare system is proposed to evaluate the HealthIoT ontology.",

The adoption of IoT in medical care field will bring great convenient to both doctors and patients for effective illness monitoring and diagnosis. Due to the high value of medical data and the openness character of health IoT, the protection of data confidentiality is of crucial importance. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed secure data management with keyword search system for health IoT. Since the patients are usually managed by diverse medical institutions, the proposed system enables distributed access control of protected health information (PHI) among different medical domains. On the other hand, the accumulation of electronic health records (EHR) makes effective data retrieval a challenge task. Our scheme could provide efficient keyword search function on cross-domain PHI. For the resource limited devices in health IoT, it is an essential requirement to design lightweight algorithms in the secure data management system. The proposed system realizes lightweight data encryption, lightweight keyword trapdoor generation and lightweight data recovery, which leaves very few computations to user's terminal. The security of this system is reduced to the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The comparison analysis is made between this scheme and other existing systems. The extensive experiments on both laptop and smart phone platforms show that the proposed scheme has greatly improved the computation efficiency and requires much less communication cost.",

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

The model was applied to assess and compare the prospect of three IoT applications — i.e. IoT healthcare, IoT logistics, and IoT energy management, inviting the perception of 31 ICT experts. The results showed that IoT logistics is the most promising IoT application, due to its strong market potential. IoT healthcare is perceived to have strength in wide consumer market demand, but reliability issues and regulation issues were posed. Meanwhile, IoT energy management showed strengths only in governmental support. The results also imply that it would be wiser for the government to focus on eliminating regulatory bottlenecks.",

Key terminologies are defined to generate user-oriented health measurements by exploring the concept of computational sciences. The architectural prototype for smart student healthcare is designed for application scenario. The results are computed after processing the health measurements in a specific context. In our case study, systematic student perspective health data is generated using UCI dataset and medical sensors to predict the student with different disease severity.

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.",

The aim is to ensure the security of patients’ healthcare data, realize access control for normal and emergency scenarios, and support smart deduplication to save the storage space in big data storage system. The medical files generated by the healthcare IoT network are encrypted and transferred to the storage system, which can be securely shared among the healthcare staff from different medical domains leveraging a cross-domain access control policy. The traditional access control technology allows the authorized data users to decrypt patient’s sensitive medical data, but also hampers the first-aid treatment when the patient’s life is threatened because the on-site first-aid personnel are not permitted to get patient’s historical medical data. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. In normal application, the healthcare staff with proper attribute secret keys can have the data access privilege; in emergency application, patient’s historical medical data can be recovered using a password-based break-glass access mechanism. To save the storage overhead in the big data storage system, a secure deduplication method is designed to eliminate the duplicate medical files with identical data, which may be encrypted with different access policies. A highlight of this smart secure deduplication method is that the remaining medical file after the deduplication can be accessed by all the data users authorized by the different original access policies. This smart healthcare big data storage system is formally proved secure, and extensive comparison and simulations demonstrate its efficiency.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

This study aims to investigate whether PPPs access in a hospital environment violates patient privacy. If so, to what extent can we manage patient privacy while accessing PPPs in this environment? We investigated this question by analyzing questionnaire-based data from two Asian countries: Group A (China) and Group B (Pakistan). For data collection, we targeted those medical entities which were directly dealing with PPPs in their routine tasks. Results suggest that patient type directly influences the collection of PPPs: Group A (one-time = 1.9, follow-up = 1.06) and Group B (one-time = 2.0 and follow-up = 1.9). Both groups agreed that patients have the right to control their own PPPs. In both, doctors are the most trusted entity: for Group A, the Pearson Chi-Square with one degree of freedom is 1.414, p = 0.234, whereas for Group B, the Pearson Chi-Square with three degrees of freedom is 4.511, p = 0.11. Most of the Group A entities (92%) are familiar with unauthorized access of PPPs, while in Group B the level was only 35%. In Group B, only 35% of entities stated the purpose, specification and use limitations of PPPs. Doctors in both groups showed a high utilization of PPPs read authorization rights. This empirical evidence about PPPs usage in both countries will benefit health technology and improve policy on patient privacy.",

abstract = "The emerging paradigm of Machine to Machine (M2M)-driven Internet of Things (IoT), where physical objects are not disconnected from the virtual world but aim at collectively provide contextual services, calls for enhanced and more energy-efficient resource management approaches. In this paper, the problem is addressed through a joint interest, physical and energy-aware clustering and resource management framework, capitalizing on the wireless powered communication (WPC) technique. Within the proposed framework the numerous M2M devices initially form different clusters based on the low complexity Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), properly adapted to account for interest, physical and energy related factors. Following that, a cluster-head is selected among the members of each cluster. The proposed approach enables the devices of a cluster with the support of the cluster-head to harvest and store energy in a stable manner through Radio Frequency (RF) signals adopting the WPC paradigm, thus prolonging the operation of the overall M2M network. Each M2M device is associated with a generic utility function, which appropriately represents its degree of satisfaction in relation to the consumed transmission power. Based on the distributed nature of the M2M network, a maximization problem of each device's utility function is formulated as a non-cooperative game and its unique Nash equilibrium point is determined, in terms of devices’ optimal transmission powers. Considering the devices’ equilibrium transmission powers, the optimal charging transmission powers of the cluster-heads are derived. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via modeling and simulation and under various topologies and scenarios, and its operational efficiency and effectiveness is demonstrated.",

abstract = "Defects and errors in new or recently completed construction work continually pervade the industry. Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.",

Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery.",

Second, a power level and packet size decision (PPD) algorithm is presented to decide the optimal packet size, by either minimizing the delay at a prescribed transmission power or minimizing energy consumption with a prescribed delay. Third, a global link decision (GLD) scheme is devised to improve overall reliability and decrease overall delay simultaneously through raising availability of battery energy within nodes. Theoretical analysis demonstrated the validity of the GLD scheme. Moreover, experimental results show that the GLD scheme improves the transmission reliability by 8.70% and decreases the delay by 7.74%, without reducing the network lifetime, which was not achieved in previous research studies.",

Then, we investigate, report, and highlight the state-of-the-art research efforts directed at IoT from a security perspective. A taxonomy is devised by classifying and categorizing the literature based on important parameters (e.g., threats, requirements, IEEE standards, deployment level, and technologies). Furthermore, a few credible case studies are outlined to alert people regarding how seriously IoT devices are vulnerable to threats. We enumerate the requirements that need to be met for securing IoT. Several indispensable open research challenges (e.g., data integrity, lightweight security mechanisms, lack of security software’s upgradability and patchability features, physical protection of trillions of devices, privacy, and trust) are identified and discussed.

Therefore, the sink node which based on embedded multi-core SoC for IoTs and maximizing its computing performance has brought into focus in recent years. In this paper, we design a multi-core Task-Efficient Sink Node (TESN) based on heterogeneous architecture and the Weighted-Least Connection (WLC) task schedule strategy has been proposed to improve its efficiency. There are two types of cores in the sink node, master core and slave cores. The master core deals with tasks allocation and the seven slave cores deal with data processing. All of the cores are communicating with each other through mailbox. By considering each core’s real-time processing information and computing performance, the proposed WLC can balance each core’s load and reduce network congestion. The XilinxV5 platform is used to evaluate the performance of WLC and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms for multi-core sink node. The experiment results show that the WLC strategy improves the processing speed obviously, achieves load balance and avoids large scale congestion of sink node in the sensor networks of IoTs.",

In such complex circumstances, the perception of interoperability needs to evolve from the consideration of interoperating pairs of systems to the capability of an autonomous system to sense, interpret, understand and act upon arbitrary messages received from a potentially unknown sender. In this sense, interoperability becomes in fact a property of the system. In this paper, we elaborate on an evolved concept of interoperability in context of ubiquitous healthcare systems.

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) has radically transformed the world; currently, every device can be connected to the Internet and provide valuable information for decision-making. In spite of the fast evolution of technologies accompanying the grow of IoT, we are still faced with the challenge of providing a service oriented architecture, which facilitates the inclusion of data coming together from several IoT devices, data delivery among a system's agents, real-time data processing and service provision to users. Furthermore, context-aware data processing and architectures still pose a challenge, in spite of being key requirements in order to get stronger IoT architectures. To face this challenge, we propose a COLLaborative ConText Aware Service Oriented Architecture (COLLECT), which facilitates both the integration of IoT heterogeneous domain context data — through the use of a light message broker — and easy data delivery among several agents and collaborative participants in the system — making use of an enterprise service bus —. In addition, this architecture provides real-time data processing thanks to the use of a complex event processing engine as well as services and intelligent decision-making procedures to users according to the needs of the domain in question. As a result, COLLECT has a great impact on context-aware decentralized and collaborative reasoning for IoT, promoting context-aware intelligent decision making in such scope. Since context-awareness is key for a wide range of recommender and intelligent systems, the presented novel solution improves decision making in a large number of fields where such systems require to promptly process a variety of ubiquitous collaborative and context-aware data.",

abstract = "The number of people with a chronic disease is rapidly increasing, giving the healthcare industry more challenging problems. To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology–aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-making knowledge using Protégé Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient for patient risk factors extraction and diabetes prescriptions.",

In this context, in January 2016, the European Commission has funded seven projects that are to deal with various aspects of interoperability in the Internet of Things. Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).",

Data produced by such sensors can be used for several purposes and by different actors, such as doctors, patients, relatives, and health care centers, in order to provide remote assistance to users. However, major challenges arise mainly in terms of the interoperability among several heterogeneous devices from a variety of manufacturers. In this context, we introduce EcoHealth (Ecosystem of Health Care Devices), a Web middleware platform for connecting doctors and patients using attached body sensors, thus aiming to provide improved health monitoring and diagnosis for patients. This platform is able to integrate information obtained from heterogeneous sensors in order to provide mechanisms to monitor, process, visualize, store, and send notifications regarding patients’ conditions and vital signs at real-time by using Internet standards. In this paper, we present blueprints of our proposal to EcoHealth and its logical architecture and implementation, as well as an e-health motivational scenario where such a platform would be useful.",

To deal with these overheads, novel metrics, and methods are introduced in an attempt to maximize the capabilities and widen acceptance/usage provided by the Internet of Things. Without losing its generality, the method discussed is experimentally evaluated in the paradigm of the Health domain. The focus is on the need for an overview of available data formats and transmission methods and selection of the optimal combination, which can result to reduction/minimization of costs. An analytic methodology is presented backed with theoretical metrics and evaluated experimentally.",

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long “lookahead” planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully or partially automate various communication functions across the construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then provides first insights – through various construction scenarios – into how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management to the management of the entire building lifecycle.",

Examples of such novel areas are Information Centric Network (ICN), Mobile ICN, Named Data Network (NDN), Internet of Things (IoT), etc. In this paper, we have surveyed those applications briefly and have proposed an alternate taxonomy for classifying existing DTN routing algorithms. The objective of this survey is to help future researchers to identify DTN specific properties in the new applications and to apply appropriate routing protocols whenever necessary. We have studied the relation between message replication and individual or group communication semantics of DTN routing protocols considering both social-based and opportunistic message forwarding techniques. We have also introduced an in-depth coverage of data dissemination protocols in DTN which can be adapted to content-centric networking domains. We conclude our survey by identifying a set of open challenges for future researchers.",

The intelligence of the presented framework lies with its ability to analyze real time health conditions during workouts and predict probabilistic health state vulnerability. For predictive purpose, the proposed framework indulges the utilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which is comprised of three phases namely, monitor, learn, and predict. In addition to this, the presented framework is supported by a mathematical foundation to predict probabilistic vulnerability, in terms of Probabilistic State of Vulnerability (PSoV). In order to determine the validity and applicability of the proposed framework, experiments were performed where 5 people with different attributes are monitored for 14 days using numerous smart sensors. Results, upon comparison with various state-of-the-art techniques, depict that the proposed system is superior in performance and is highly effective in delivering healthcare services during workouts.",

Under the same experimental conditions, some myotube formation was observed when RMo cells were used, but the number and size of the myotubes were reduced substantially compared to untreated controls. The addition of Mojave toxin to established myotubes that arose from differentiation of primary myoblasts or C2 myoblasts essentially led to total disappearance of the myotubes from the cell layer within 48 hr. Myotubes from RMo cells treated in the same manner, however, did not disappear, but they were smaller and less numerous than comparable controls. Similar results were generated by exposure of myotubes to the basic subunit of Mojave toxin under the same conditions. The underlying layer of mononucleate cells was retained in both instances. Toxin-free cultures continued to develop in the usual manner. Treatment with 1.0 μM concentrations of the acidic subunit, pancreatic phospholipase A2 or a non-neurotoxic phospholipase from Naja naja atra gave results indistinguishable from untreated control cultures.",

This model of client–server data communication has evolved into a peer-to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times. Applications like, YouTube, Bit Torrent, social networks have revolutionized the idea of user generated contents. Modern users care only for specific data items irrespective of their sources. So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth.

abstract = "The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an emerging computing technology that involves in sensing, computing, controlling and communication between physical components (e.g., smart sensors, devices, systems and human beings) and cyber components (e.g., cloud and big data centers). The sensing, controlling and interaction have significant promises towards the realization of the current and future therapy system, where cloud resources and data centers are expected to process complex therapeutic heterogeneous big data. Although, the CPS has a great potential for such a sensing and controlling of therapy, however, energy efficiency is crucial for such a therapy system for its sustainability, especially for elderly people who cannot physically optimize energy consumptions. To this end, this article proposes an energy-aware cyber-physical therapy system (T-CPS), which incorporates smart things and devices in both the physical and cyber world for therapy sensing. To provide energy-efficient affordable therapeutic services, the T-CPS framework uses multi-modal sensing for the provision of therapy sensing, therapy playback, annotation, visualization, and energy efficiency. The framework was evaluated by real subjects along with several therapists. Test results show the usefulness of the proposed T-CPS framework.",
