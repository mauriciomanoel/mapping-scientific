abstract = "With the increase of collected information, the computing performance of single-core sink node for Internet of Things (IoTs) cannot satisfy with the demand of large data processing any more. Therefore, the sink node which based on embedded multi-core SoC for IoTs and maximizing its computing performance has brought into focus in recent years. In this paper, we design a multi-core Task-Efficient Sink Node (TESN) based on heterogeneous architecture and the Weighted-Least Connection (WLC) task schedule strategy has been proposed to improve its efficiency. There are two types of cores in the sink node, master core and slave cores. The master core deals with tasks allocation and the seven slave cores deal with data processing. All of the cores are communicating with each other through mailbox. By considering each core’s real-time processing information and computing performance, the proposed WLC can balance each core’s load and reduce network congestion. The XilinxV5 platform is used to evaluate the performance of WLC and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms for multi-core sink node. The experiment results show that the WLC strategy improves the processing speed obviously, achieves load balance and avoids large scale congestion of sink node in the sensor networks of IoTs.",

The common approach enabling a resource constrained device to get connected to the Internet is through programming instructions and transferring it to an embedded device. This procedure involves various tools and cross-compiling of the code depending on the platform architecture. In practical IoT applications, where a huge number of nodes exist, this process becomes almost impossible due to the heterogeneous platforms and protocols involved and the deployment conditions. This paper introduces a flexible and scalable approach that enhances modifiability and programmability through client-server-server-client architecture. It allows changing the behavior of the system after deployment through a lightweight script written with a domain specific language, DoS-IL, and stored in a gateway at the fog layer. An embedded resource browser is used to request and execute the script. The results of analysis for this model and the tools developed along the way are discussed.",

In this context, we present a system that enables PHDs to share information in home networks and with the Internet based on a new Internet of Things protocol, namely the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is used along with the IEEE 11073 family of standards, which is the main exchange data model for PHD communication. We discuss how the proposed system can be integrated to other connected health systems, such as a Universal Plug and Play healthcare system. We detail how the CoAP communication model was adapted to the IEEE 11073 model. We also present a real PHD prototype and its evaluation results. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution, showing how its network overhead is around 50% lighter when compared to other protocols. Finally, we tested the proposed solution based on different scenarios, including a proof-of-concept integration with a service in the cloud, using different wireless physical interfaces.",

IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between “everything”, IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytics tools are able to extract “sense” from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.",

However, a reference architecture integrating IoT services into either of these two technologies is still an open research challenge. In this article, we adopt the resource oriented approach to provide an end-to-end integration architecture of front-end IoT devices with the back-end business process applications. The proposed architecture promises a programmer friendly access to IoT services, an event management mechanism to propagate context information of IoT devices, a service replacement facility upon service failure, and a decentralized execution of the IoT aware business processes.",

Sensors and smart objects are beside classical computing devices key parties of the IOT. We can already exploit the benefits of the IOT by using various weareables or smart phones which are full of diverse sensors and actuators and are connected to the II via GPRS or Wi-Fi. Since sensors are a key part of IOT, thus are wireless sensor networks (WSN). Researchers are already working on new techniques and efficient approaches on how to integrate WSN better into the IOT environment. One aspect of it is the security aspect of the integration. Recently, Turkanović et al.’s proposed a highly efficient and novel user authentication and key agreement scheme (UAKAS) for heterogeneous WSN (HWSN) which was adapted to the IOT notion. Their scheme presented a novel approach where a user from the IOT can authenticate with a specific sensor node from the HWSN without having to communicate with a gateway node. Moreover their scheme is highly efficient since it is based on a simple symmetric cryptosystem. Unfortunately we have found that Turkanović et al.’s scheme has some security shortcomings and is susceptible to some cryptographic attacks. This paper focuses on overcoming the security weaknesses of Turkanović et al.’s scheme, by proposing a new and improved UAKAS. The proposed scheme enables the same functionality but improves the security level and enables the HWSN to dynamically grow without influencing any party involved in the UAKAS. The results of security analysis by BAN-logic and AVISPA tools confirm the security properties of the proposed scheme.",

Whilst risk and threat assessments generally assume a stable and well-defined environment, this cannot be done in MIoT environments where devices may be added, removed, or changed in their configuration including connectivity to server back ends. Conducting a complete threat assessment for each such configuration changes is infeasible.

Their security, in a world where the Internet of Things has become a reality, is paramount to the continued safety of patients that are dependent upon these devices. The international standard ISO/IEC 80001 – Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices presents a unified and amalgamated approach to the safety of medical devices connected to IT networks. Whilst this standard presents a guide for security and risk management in health delivery organisations, its effectiveness with regard to contemporary cybersecurity is unknown. This research employed a structured review process to compare and analyse the ISO/IEC 80001 technical controls standards (ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 and ISO/IEC 80001-2-8), with contemporary cybersecurity best practice, guidelines and standards. The research deconstructed the technical controls and drew links between these standards and cybersecurity best practice to assess the level of harmonisation. Subsequently, a deeper analysis identified the areas of omission, coverage, addition or improvement that may impact the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 80001 to provide effective cybersecurity protection. ISO/IEC 80001 aims to provide a minimal level of cybersecurity however this research demonstrates that there are deficiencies in the standard and identifies the important aspects of cybersecurity that could be improved. This situation has arisen due to the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment and the protracted time to revise and republish international standards. This research identified several areas that require urgent consideration, including Emergency Access, Health Data De-Identification, Physical Locks on Devices, Data Backup, Disaster Recovery, Third-Party Components in Product Lifecycle Roadmap, Transmission Confidentiality, and Transmission Integrity. The research will provide health delivery organisations implementing ISO/IEC 80001, assurance as to the level of protection supplied by the ISO/IEC 80001 standard, and the areas that may need enhancement to increase cybersecurity protection and consequently increase in patient safety. Further, the outcomes are expected to influence development of the related international standard, as the findings from this research are being provided to the International Organisations for Standardisation, TC215 Health Informatics, Joint Working Group 7, to inform the review of ISO/IEC 80001 currently in progress.",

abstract = "Pulmonary cancer is considered as one of the major causes of death worldwide. For the detection of lung cancer, computer-assisted diagnosis (CADx) systems have been designed. Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled ubiquitous internet access to biomedical datasets and techniques; in result, the progress in CADx is significant. Unlike the conventional CADx, deep learning techniques have the basic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature as they have the ability to learn mid and high level image representations. We proposed a Computer-Assisted Decision Support System in Pulmonary Cancer by using the novel deep learning based model and metastasis information obtained from MBAN (Medical Body Area Network). The proposed model, DFCNet, is based on the deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) which is used for classification of each detected pulmonary nodule into four lung cancer stages. The performance of proposed work is evaluated on different datasets with varying scan conditions. Comparison of proposed classifier is done with the existing CNN techniques. Overall accuracy of CNN and DFCNet was 77.6% and 84.58%, respectively. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the detection and classification of lung cancer nodules. These results demonstrate the potential for the proposed technique in helping the radiologists in improving nodule detection accuracy with efficiency.",

This combination enables a wide range of new applications and opportunities – particularly in the biomedical domain – but it also entails a number of new challenges. One of many research challenges in functional and non-functional aspects is the addressing and naming of nodes in a nano network. Our study in this area not only includes traditional techniques driven from today’s IoT, but also new unconventional ideas, originating from molecular level communication. We come up with a summary of either theoretical, simulated or realized ideas to draw conclusions about implementations and performance potential, with a focus on medical in-body communication scenarios, before we present our concept, Function Centric Nano-Networking (FCNN). FCNN allows us to address groups of interchangeable nano machines in a network by using location information and functional capabilities of the machines. This concept does not rely on the durability and uniqueness of individual nodes. We are comparing the novel concept of FCNN with similar ones and highlight elementary differences between them as well advantages and disadvantages.",

One of the main reasons is that the data that need to be analyzed may exceed the storage size of a single machine. The computation cost of data analysis tasks that is too high for a single computer system is another critical problem we have to confront when analyzing data from an IoT system. That is why an efficient data clustering framework for metaheuristic algorithm on a cloud computing environment is presented in this paper for data analytics, which explains how to divide mining tasks of a mining algorithm into different nodes (i.e., the Map process) and then aggregate the mining results from these nodes (i.e., Reduce process). We further attempted to use the proposed framework to implement data clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, genetic k-means, and particle swarm optimization) on a standalone system and Spark. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed framework makes it useful to develop data clustering algorithms on a cloud computing environment.",

This review will analyse key aspects of deploying a DfPL WSN in IoT scenario for disaster management. In an IoT scenario the DfPL WSN is only collecting raw data that is forwarded to the Internet using a Compressed Sensing (CS) IoT framework or other solutions including data compression. Compressed Sensing (CS) refers to a method used to reduce the number of samples collected in an IoT WSN. Thus it is possible to create stand-alone applications that require fewer resources. There is no need to process the data in the WSN as this can be done in the Data Analysis Network, after the data is reconstructed. This will enable a reduced volume of data transmitted and lower power consumption for battery-operated nodes. The detection of people in a disaster scenario who are simply moving and not in the possession of a ‘tracking device’ is revolutionary. The aim here is to build upon our patent-pended technology in order to deliver a robust field-trial ready human detection system for disaster situations.",

This paper proposes a cyber risk scoring system that considers a physician’s worst-case assessment of the potential of a medical device to impact a patient. The scoring system also relies on a security questionnaire based on the STRIDE model that helps generate a risk score for the medical device. Three test scenarios involving medical devices are used to demonstrate the application and utility of the risk scoring system.",

In this paper, we present a comparison of two approaches based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for implementing a Real-Time Monitoring System of Meal Distribution Trolleys in a hospital. The performance evaluation results show that the IoT implementation yields much lower latencies than the WSN implementation, and the latency does not depend on the location of the trolley or the building size. Also, the IoT approach yields slightly better battery life expectancy than the WSN approach. Thus, the IoT approach seems the best option for real-time surveillance systems installed in meal distribution trolleys.",

The demand-side management (DSM) of energy systems has drawn considerable industrial and academic attention in attempts to form new flexibilities to respond to variations in renewable energy inputs to the system. However, many DSM concepts are still in the experimental demonstration phase. One of the obstacles to DSM usage is that the current information infrastructure was mainly designed for centralized systems, and does not meet DSM requirements. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a novel information infrastructure named the Internet of Energy Things (IoET) in order to make DSM practicable by basing it on the latest wireless communication technology: the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The primary advantage of LPWAN over general packet radio service (GPRS) and area Internet of Things (IoT) is its wide-area coverage, which comes with minimum power consumption and maintenance costs. Against this background, this paper briefly reviews the representative LPWAN technologies of narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Range (LoRa) technology, and compares them with GPRS and area IoT technology. Next, a wireless-to-cloud architecture is proposed for the IoET, based on the main technical features of LPWAN. Finally, this paper looks forward to the potential of IoET in various DSM application scenarios.",

Because the traditional healthcare mode is passive, by which patients call the healthcare service by themselves.

The Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have overwhelming superiority in solving the problem of heart diseases patients care as they can change the service mode into a pervasive way, and trigger the healthcare service based on patients’ physical status rather than their feelings. In order to realize the pervasive healthcare service, a remote monitoring system is essential. In this paper, we proposed a pervasive monitoring system that can send patients’ physical signs to remote medical applications in real time. The system is mainly composed of two parts: the data acquisition part and the data transmission part. The monitoring scheme (monitoring parameters and frequency for each parameter) is the key point of the data acquisition part, and we designed it based on interviews to medical experts. Multiple physical signs (blood pressure, ECG, SpO2, heart rate, pulse rate, blood fat and blood glucose) as well as an environmental indicator (patients’ location) are designed to be sampled at different rates continuously. Four data transmission modes are presented taking patients’ risk, medical analysis needs, demands for communication and computing resources into consideration.

Among them, wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs) have been used in the personalized healthcare systems (PHSs). In recent years, professionals use their mobile devices to access the data collected from sensors which are placed in or on patients’ bodies. Due to the danger of wireless transmission circumstance, the security of the data which are collected by the sensors and also transmitted to the doctors faces challenges. In the past decade, many authentication schemes for WMSNs are proposed. However, security disadvantages have been found in such schemes. To overcome the historical security problems, we propose a robust and lightweight authentication scheme for WMSNs, which meets the common security requirements, and keeps away user tracking from attackers. The popular tool Proverif is employed to express that our scheme resists the simulated attacks. Also, the informal security analysis is demonstrated. With the comparison to several very recent schemes and simulation by NS-3, the proposed scheme is suitable for PHSs.",

abstract = "The explosive growth of data in volume, velocity and diversity that are produced by medical applications has contributed to abundance of big data. Current solutions for efficient data storage and management cannot fulfill the needs of heterogeneous data. Therefore, by applying computational intelligence (CI) approaches in medical data helps get better management, faster performance and higher level of accuracy in detection. This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art of computational intelligence approaches in medical data and to categorize the existing CI techniques, used in medical fields, as single and hybrid. In addition, the techniques and methodologies, their limitations and performances are presented in this study. The limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for Computational Intelligence Medical Data (CIMD) in establishing an efficient CIMD architectural design. The results show that on the one hand Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) as a single based computational intelligence approach were the best methods in medical applications. On the other hand, the hybridization of SVM with other methods such as SVM-Genetic Algorithm (SVM-GA), SVM-Artificial Immune System (SVM-AIS), SVM-AIRS and fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) had great performances achieving better results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.",

abstract = "In wireless medical sensor network (WMSN), bio-sensors are implanted within the patient body to sense the sensitive information of a patient which later on can be transmitted to the remote medical centers for further processing. The patient’s data can be accessed using WMSN by medical professionals from anywhere across the globe with the help of Internet. As the patient sensitive information is transmitted over an insecure WMSN, so providing a secure access and privacy of the patient’s data are challenging issues in WMSN environments. However, in literature, to provide secure data access, few user authentication protocols exist. Most of these existing protocols may not be applicable to WMSNs for providing user’s anonymity. To fill these gaps, in this article, we propose an architecture for patient monitoring health-care system in WMSN and then design an anonymity-preserving mutual authentication protocol for mobile users. We used the AVISPA tool to simulate the proposed protocol. The results obtained indicate that the proposed authentication protocol resists the existing well known attacks. In addition, the BAN logic model confirms mutual authentication feature of the proposed protocol. Moreover, an informal cryptanalysis is also given, which ensures that the proposed protocol withstands all known attacks. We perform a comparative discussion of the proposed protocol against the existing protocols and the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is efficient and robust. Specifically, the proposed protocol is not only effective in providing robustness against common security threats, but it also offers an efficient login, robust mutual authentication, and user-friendly password change.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

For instance, data captured by multiple visual sensors need further computation or fusion, which is based on a network of making a decision or an analysis. A new image fusion method is proposed by using rolling guidance filter and joint bilateral filter in this paper. First, the saliency maps of two source images are extracted by the Kirsch operator. Subsequently, the two source images are decomposed by rolling guidance filter to obtain multi-scale images. Second, joint bilateral filter and optimal correction are utilized to optimize the saliency maps and obtain the final weight maps. Finally, two fusion rules are used to restore the final fused image. The proposed method not only preserves the details of source images, but also suppresses the artifacts effectively. Experimental results prove that our method generates better effects on both visual perception and objective quantization than traditional methods.",

abstract = "Background
As a new application technology of the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent medical treatment has attracted the attention of both nations and industries through its promotion of medical informatisation, modernisation, and intelligentisation. Faced with a wide variety of intelligent medical terminals, consumers may be affected by various factors when making purchase decisions.
Purpose
To examine and evaluate the key influential factors (and their interrelationships) of consumer adoption behavior for improving and promoting intelligent medical terminals toward achieving set aspiration level in each dimension and criterion.
Method
A hybrid modified Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model was used for this study, based on three components: (1) the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique, to build an influential network relationship map (INRM) at both ‘dimensions’ and ‘criteria’ levels; (2) the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) method, to determine the interrelationships and influential weights among the criteria and identify the source-influential factors; and (3) the modified Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, to evaluate and improve for reducing the performance gaps to meet the consumers’ needs for continuous improvement and sustainable products-development. First, a consensus on the influential factors affecting consumers’ adoption of intelligent medical terminals was collected from experts’ opinion in practical experience. Next, the interrelationships and influential weights of DANP among dimensions/criteria based on the DEMATEL technique were determined. Finally, two intelligent medicine bottles (AdhereTech, A1 alternative; and Audio/Visual Alerting Pillbox, A2 alternative) were reviewed as the terminal devices to verify the accuracy of the MADM model and evaluate its performance on each criterion for improving the total certification gaps by systematics according to the modified VIKOR method based on an INRM.
Results
In this paper, the criteria and dimensions used to improve the evaluation framework are validated. The systematic evaluation in index system is constructed on the basis of five dimensions and corresponding ten criteria. Influential weights of all criteria ranges from 0.037 to 0.152, which shows the rank of criteria importance. The evaluative framework were validated synthetically and scientifically. INRM (influential network relation map) was obtained from experts’ opinion through DEMATEL technique shows complex interrelationship among factors. At the dimension level, the environmental dimension influences other dimensions the most, whereas the security dimension is most influenced by others. So the improvement order of environmental dimension is prior to security dimension. The newly constructed approach was still further validated by the results of the empirical case, where performance gap improvement strategies were analyzed for decision-makers. The modified VIKOR method was especially validated for solving real-world problems in intelligent medical terminal improvement processes. For this paper, A1 performs better than A2, however, promotion mix, brand factor, and market environment are shortcomings faced by both A1 and A2. In addition, A2 should be improved in the wireless network technology, and the objective contact with a high degree of gaps.
Conclusions
Based on the evaluation index system and the integrated model proposed here, decision-makers in enterprises can identify gaps when promoting intelligent medical terminals, from which they can get valuable advice to improve consumer adoption. Additionally, an INRM and the influential weights of DANP can be combined using the modified VIKOR method as integrated weightings to determine how to reduce gaps and provide the best improvement strategies for reaching set aspiration levels.",

Disruption to the more traditional industrial practices and processes is inevitable. High Performance Cutting is no exception. Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) opens up new and extremely powerful capabilities to help us gain a significantly deeper understanding of the fundamentals of cutting processes and offers entirely new connectivity possibilities at all interfaces, some old and some new, “between the Chip Root and the Cloud”. This supports us in our attempts since the foundation of CIRP in 1951 to remove technological roadblocks and can lead on a new journey towards new and unprecedented scientific/technological developments as well as new business models for companies involved in the various elements of the supply chain for cutting processes (DIN 8580). “Performance” will take on a new and unanticipated meaning over what was originally meant when we established this CIRP-HPC Conference back in the early 2000's. In this paper a critical review of a previous roadmap is undertaken for cutting processes presented in a CIRP Keynote Paper in 2003 by Byrne, Dornfeld and Denkena [1] and new thoughts and ideas are presented on a vision for a 2020 skeleton Roadmap for High Performance Cutting in the new age of Digitisation.",

abstract = "The steep rise of Internet of Things (IoT) applications along with the limitations of Cloud Computing to address all IoT requirements leveraged a new distributed computing paradigm called Fog Computing, which aims to process data at the edge of the network. With the help of Fog Computing, the transmission latency, monetary spending and application loss caused by Cloud Computing can be effectively reduced. However, as the processing capacity of fog nodes is more limited than that of cloud platforms, running all applications indiscriminately on these nodes can cause some QoS requirement to be violated. Therefore, there is important decision-making as to where executing each application in order to produce a cost effective solution and fully meet application requirements. In particular, we are interested in the tradeoff in terms of average response time, average cost and average number of application loss. In this paper, we present an online algorithm, called unit-slot optimization, based on the technique of Lyapunov optimization. The unit-slot optimization is a quantified near-optimal online solution to balance the three-way tradeoff among average response time, average cost and average number of application loss. We evaluate the performance of the unit-slot optimization algorithm by a number of experiments. The experimental results not only match up the theoretical analyses properly, but also demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can provide cost-effective processing, while guaranteeing average response time and average number of application loss in a three-tier Cloud of Things system.",

These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

It makes the medical search technologies become critical to find useful patient information in the large medical dataset.

In this paper, by exploiting the uncertainty in ambiguous medical queries, we propose a novel semantic-based approach to achieve the diversity-aware retrieval of EMRs, i.e., both the relevance and novelty are considered for EMR ranking. With the support of medical domain ontologies, we first mine all the potential semantics (concepts and relations between them) from a user query and consume them to model the multiple query aspects. Then, we propose a novel diversification strategy, which considers not only the aspect importance but also the aspect similarity, to perform the diversity-aware EMR ranking. A real-world pilot study, which utilizes the proposed medical search approach to improve the second use of the EMRs, is reported. We believe that our experience can serve as an important reference for the development of similar applications in a medical data utilization and sharing environment.",

A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.",

It thus enables companies to cope with the challenges of producing increasingly individualized products with a short lead-time to market and higher quality. Intelligent manufacturing plays an important role in Industry 4.0. Typical resources are converted into intelligent objects so that they are able to sense, act, and behave within a smart environment. In order to fully understand intelligent manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper provides a comprehensive review of associated topics such as intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled manufacturing, and cloud manufacturing. Similarities and differences in these topics are highlighted based on our analysis. We also review key technologies such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, big data analytics (BDA), and information and communications technology (ICT) that are used to enable intelligent manufacturing. Next, we describe worldwide movements in intelligent manufacturing, including governmental strategic plans from different countries and strategic plans from major international companies in the European Union, United States, Japan, and China. Finally, we present current challenges and future research directions. The concepts discussed in this paper will spark new ideas in the effort to realize the much-anticipated Fourth Industrial Revolution.",

Recent studies confirm a steep and constant increase of the diffusion of smart objects, which are capable to interact with the real world and to communicate and gather information autonomously through Internet connections. In the rush of devising and releasing to the market the next killer application for the IoT domain, critical issues regarding the cybersecurity risks are currently overlooked. Because security, like most software qualities, is not an orthogonal requirement, i.e. one that can be satisfied by adding some features at any development stage, this is going to have a very costly impact, potentially leading to failure, on the technologies currently developed for the IoT domain. In order to cope adequately with such issues, IoT applications need to be designed to be secure since their inception and suitable security assessment tools should be made available. This paper describes an approach based on the exploitation of virtual environments and agent-based simulation for the evaluation of cybersecurity solutions for the next generation of IoT applications in realistic scenarios. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by considering a concrete case study involving the cooperation of real and virtual smart devices inside a virtualized scenario where security issues are first evaluated and then handled.",

These medical devices are surgically implanted into patient's bodies and wirelessly configured by prescribing physicians and healthcare professionals using external programmers. However, these devices are threatened by a set of lethal attacks, due to the use of vulnerable wireless communication and security protocols, and the lack of security protection mechanisms deployed on IMDs. In this paper, we propose a digital investigation system for the postmortem analysis of lethal attack scenarios on cardiac IMDs. After developing a set of techniques allowing the secure storage of digital evidence logs which track the executed sensitive events, we implement an in-depth security solution allowing the protection of cardiac IMDs. An inference system integrating a library of medical rules is proposed to automatically infer potential medical scenarios that caused the patient's death, or that created heart-related emergency situations (through the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia for example). A Model Checking based formal technique to reconstruct potential technical attack scenarios on a cardiac IMD, starting from the collected evidence, is also proposed. The results obtained by the two proposed reasoning techniques (i.e., the inference system and the Model Checking based algorithm) are correlated to prove whether a potential attack scenario is responsible of the occurrence of heart-related emergency situations or the death of a patient. Based on the proposed techniques, we design a decision-support system that reconciles in the same framework the medical and technical investigation aspects.",

This emerging environment is an always-on, ubiquitous, integrated system comprised of the Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence/Intelligent Systems and the Intercloud, which act together as a single system, referred to here as the “Embedded Infosphere” (EI). This development is driving the latest stage – the third – in the evolution of U.S. communications policy. Each of the components of the EI presents unique challenges, but the greater concern is all of them acting in concert. These developments bring into focus many topics that have been outside the traditional communications policy envelope, and exceed the portfolios of existing agencies and institutions. This article envisions a new “EI policy space,” grounded in established societal values, and built on the experience of the previous stages. There are appropriate policy responses to each of the challenges, but these responses need to be seen in a holistic perspective, as they are all interconnected. Many of the issues such as privacy, security, consumer protection, and data stewardship are common across several elements. The larger goal is to establish a framework for an integrated policy structure which can address unpredictable emergent conditions, while allowing markets to flourish without unduly burdensome regulations, restrictions or uncertainties. This articles suggests a high-level analytical framework of criteria against which proposed EI policies can be measured. While there may be no “perfect” policies, some may be better (or worse) than others. It also offers a political process designed to incorporate the concept of the EI into national policy thinking. This approach should be implemented through a series of steps and should provide flexibility for development. The initial step is a process by which the EI can be acknowledged, its development analyzed, and the national interests institutionalized. The U.S. Senate has already initiated this process with the pending “DIGIT” Act, designed to bring together the core federal stakeholders and open a policy discourse which will be expanded over time to other key stakeholders. This should lead to the development of a national EI strategy. Since the EI is progressively global, the article suggests how both the normative and regulatory dimensions can be approached in the global context. It raises the possibility of a restructured ICANN “Empowered Community” as a possible venue for developing policies and recommendations in this area. It notes that since global unanimity is unlikely, non-governmental regimes will likely develop to address the unresolved policy interstices.",

Health monitoring systems based on Internet-of-things (IoT) have been recently introduced to improve the quality of health care services. However, the number of advanced IoT-based continuous glucose monitoring systems is small and the existing systems have several limitations. In this paper we study feasibility of invasive and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system utilizing IoT based approach. We designed an IoT-based system architecture from a sensor device to a back-end system for presenting real-time glucose, body temperature and contextual data (i.e. environmental temperature) in graphical and human-readable forms to end-users such as patients and doctors. In addition, nRF communication protocol is customized for suiting to the glucose monitoring system and achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate energy consumption of the sensor device and design energy harvesting units for the device. Finally, the work provides many advanced services at a gateway level such as a push notification service for notifying patient and doctors in case of abnormal situations (i.e. too low or too high glucose level). The results show that our system is able to achieve continuous glucose monitoring remotely in real-time. In addition, the results reveal that a high level of energy efficiency can be achieved by applying the customized nRF component, the power management unit and the energy harvesting unit altogether in the sensor device.",

Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery.",

abstract = "Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration.",

Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.",

However, urban problems, e.g., environmental pollution, resources shortage, and traffic jam, have been more and more serious for urban management and development. Smart city has been put forward as an effective approach to achieve better urban management recently. Smart city aims to realize the integration of municipal service, business, transportation, water, energy source and other urban sub-systems through close combination of human wisdom and information communication techniques (ICTs). As a result, the link and synergy of information could be ultimately established with ICTs, e.g., internet, internet of things, cloud computing. Yet, few studies have been conducted to systematically link smart city with big data in China. This paper aims to put forward a development framework of smart city with Chinese characteristics against the background of big data. Key actions, including rational planning of city infrastructures, the establishment and improvement of long-acting mechanism, the effective performance of city managerial function, are proposed to realize the development idea. Meanwhile, this paper also investigates the risks embedded in development of smart city with Chinese characteristics, e.g., information safety, weak emergency responding capacity and poor independent research and development capacity of core technology. This study can facilitate Chinese local governments to systematically plan smart city before clinging the hot concept in a rush.",

In order to achieve semantic interoperability in smart homes we have developed Smart Home Ontology, which gives semantics for the data that are exchanged by the systems and devices in a smart home. From technology point of view, we have studied the combination of cloud computing and Internet of Things as they enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual “things”, thus stimulating innovations in both fields.

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient’s emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. Finally, we outline our prototype which runs on multiple computing platforms and show results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena.",

With the development of the Internet of Things, it is just a matter of time before devices have to collaborate and compete with each other, in order to provide better services to mankind. These embedded software systems are increasingly autonomous and connected, and can thus be modeled as multiagent systems (MAS). Only 30 years ago it was science fiction that over a billion people will exchange billions of e-mails on a daily basis. Today a scenario of millions of collaborating agents sometimes embedded in gadgets and appliances, sometimes in form of networked and big data services, may also sound futuristic. However given the current rate of development in electronics, we will soon have to manage large scale MAS where millions of agents exist, collaborate and compete. Organization theory provides the necessary methodology to approach complex systems in order to design, implement and strategically manage them towards success. In this paper a state-of-the-art on organizational design techniques for large-scale MAS will be presented, missing advancements will be identified and a roadmap for future developments and application scenarios will be provided.",

A MBAN includes a set of sensor nodes deployed such, they can be located on, in, or around the patient body. They are used to monitor physiological signs, which are transmitted then to medical servers without hampering the patient activities. Security is one of the main challenging issues in MBANs since the data nature is highly sensitive. In order to ensure the reliable gathering of patient critical information, it is vital to provide authentication to prevent an attacker from impersonating legitimate sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a patient body motion based authentication solution. The routine activities, as walking or running, are characterized through a generic model allowing to identify the patient sensor nodes. Through the security analysis, we show its robustness against the well known attacks. In addition, we develop an analytical model to measure the impact of physical and logical attacks on the proposed solution with comparison to the existing protocols. We also evaluate the proposed solution through simulations with respect of important criteria, namely the transmission overhead, response time and energy consumption. The proposed solution demonstrates the best results in performance with comparison to the existing protocols. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype of the proposed solution, where it demonstrates promising results in terms of true acceptation and false rejection.",

This protocol is based on collaboration to establish a secure end-to-end communication channel between a highly resource constrained node and a remote entity. The secure channel allows the constrained node to transmit captured data while ensuring confidentiality and authentication. To achieve this goal, we propose offloading highly consuming cryptographic primitives to third parties. As a result, the constrained node obtains assistance from powerful entities. To assess our protocol, we conduct a formal validation regarding security properties. In addition, we evaluate both communication and computational costs to highlight energy savings. The results show that our protocol provides a considerable gain in energy while its security properties are ensured.",

The aim is to ensure the security of patients’ healthcare data, realize access control for normal and emergency scenarios, and support smart deduplication to save the storage space in big data storage system. The medical files generated by the healthcare IoT network are encrypted and transferred to the storage system, which can be securely shared among the healthcare staff from different medical domains leveraging a cross-domain access control policy. The traditional access control technology allows the authorized data users to decrypt patient’s sensitive medical data, but also hampers the first-aid treatment when the patient’s life is threatened because the on-site first-aid personnel are not permitted to get patient’s historical medical data. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. In normal application, the healthcare staff with proper attribute secret keys can have the data access privilege; in emergency application, patient’s historical medical data can be recovered using a password-based break-glass access mechanism. To save the storage overhead in the big data storage system, a secure deduplication method is designed to eliminate the duplicate medical files with identical data, which may be encrypted with different access policies. A highlight of this smart secure deduplication method is that the remaining medical file after the deduplication can be accessed by all the data users authorized by the different original access policies. This smart healthcare big data storage system is formally proved secure, and extensive comparison and simulations demonstrate its efficiency.",

For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on eight dimensions, including the SMACIT (Social Mobile Analytics Cloud Internet of Things) perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a systematic mapping study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications. The results have shown that significant contributions have been made by the research community, attested by a continuous increase in the number of scientific publications that address Big Data. We found that researchers are increasingly involved in research combining Big Data and Analytics, Cloud, Internet of things, mobility or social media. As for quality objectives, besides an interest in performance, other topics as scalability is emerging. Moreover, security and quality aspects become important. Researchers on Big Data provide more algorithms, frameworks, and architectures than other artifacts. Finally, application domains such as earth, energy, medicine, ecology, marketing, and health attract more attention from researchers on big data. A complementary content analysis on a subset of papers sheds some light on the evolving field of big data research.",

abstract = "Development of Internet of things (IoT) has revitalized the feature scale of wearables and smart home/city applications. The landscape of these applications encountering big data needs to be replotted on cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources of small devices. However, with the rapid increase in the number of Internet-connected devices, the increased demand of real-time, low-latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional cloud computing framework. Although, fog computing, by providing elastic resources and services to end users at the edge of network, emerges as a promising solution, but the upsurge of novel social applications such as crowd sensing has fostered the need for scalable cost-efficient platforms that can enable distributed data analytics, while optimizing the allocation of resources and minimizing the response time. Following the existing trends, we are motivated to propose a fog computing based scheme, called MIST (i.e. a cloud near the earth's surface with lesser density than fog), to support crowd sensing applications in the context of IoT. For cost-efficient provisioning limited resources, we also jointly investigate data consumer association, task distribution, and virtual machine placement towards MIST. We first formulate the problem into a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and then linearise it into a mixed integer linear program (MILP). A comprehensive evaluation of MIST is performed by consideration of real world parameters of the Tehran province, the capital of Iran. Results show that as the number of applications demanding real-time service increases, the MIST fog-based scheme outperforms traditional cloud computing.",

abstract = "The evolution of mobile devices has triggered the appearance of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). IPAs are software agents used to support users to fulfill several daily actions. They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately. The algorithms used for each mobile gateway service, and the scenarios where the mobile gateway acts as a communication channel or a smart object are also addressed on this paper.",

This paper seeks to discuss the opportunities of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, since implications are expected in this field. The authors pursue the goal of shedding light on the young and mostly undiscovered topic of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, thus following a conceptual research approach. At first, a logistics-oriented Industry 4.0 application model as well as the core components of Industry 4.0 are presented. Different logistics scenarios illustrate potential implications in a practice-oriented manner and are discussed with industrial experts. The studies reveal opportunities in terms of decentralisation, self-regulation and efficiency. Moreover, it becomes apparent that the concept of Industry 4.0 still lacks a clear understanding and is not fully established in practice yet. The investigations demonstrate potential Industry 4.0 implications in the context of Just-in-Time/Just-in-Sequence and cross-company Kanban systems in a precise manner. Practitioners could use the described scenarios as a reference to foster their own Industry 4.0 initiatives, with respect to logistics management.",

abstract = "Storing and sharing of medical data in the cloud environment, where computing resources including storage is provided by a third party service provider, raise serious concern of individual privacy for the adoption of cloud computing technologies. Existing privacy protection researches can be classified into three categories, i.e., privacy by policy, privacy by statistics, and privacy by cryptography. However, the privacy concerns and data utilization requirements on different parts of the medical data may be quite different. The solution for medical dataset sharing in the cloud should support multiple data accessing paradigms with different privacy strengths. The statistics or cryptography technology alone cannot enforce the multiple privacy demands, which blocks their application in the real-world cloud. This paper proposes a practical solution for privacy preserving medical record sharing for cloud computing. Based on the classification of the attributes of medical records, we use vertical partition of medical dataset to achieve the consideration of different parts of medical data with different privacy concerns. It mainly includes four components, i.e., (1) vertical data partition for medical data publishing, (2) data merging for medical dataset accessing, (3) integrity checking, and (4) hybrid search across plaintext and ciphertext, where the statistical analysis and cryptography are innovatively combined together to provide multiple paradigms of balance between medical data utilization and privacy protection. A prototype system for the large scale medical data access and sharing is implemented. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",

In the second phase to identify the potential feature vector GA based feature selection is done, using a hybrid approach of “Branch and Bound Algorithm” and “Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm” using the breast cancer, Brain tumour and thyroid images. The Chi Square distance measurement is used to assess the similarity between query images and database images. A fitness function with respect Minimum description length principle were used as initial requirement for genetic algorithm. In the third phase to improve the performance of the hybrid content based medical image retrieval system diverse density based relevance feedback method is used. The term hybrid is used as this system can be used to retrieve any kind of medical image such as breast cancer, brain tumour, lung cancer, thyroid cancer and so on.

By keeping eyes on low classification efficiency and accuracy of existing image retrieval system based on traditional BOW, a new classification method combined features of scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and GIST principle (CGSF) is proposed. This method use SIFT algorithm to extract the local feature vector and GIST algorithm to extract the global feature vector for images. The feature fusion scheme is applied to combine local with global features through weight which can enhance the classification accuracy with efficiency. At the end, VLFeat linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the visual dictionary and Osirix medical computed tomography (CT) image dataset is selected for experimental verification. Three experiments are carried out based on factors that contribute to performance and accuracy (dictionary size and λ co-efficient). The experimental results prove that our proposed technique is much robust and accurate than traditional algorithms in image retrieval. Furthermore, our method is matched with literature in classification accuracy and the outcomes indicate the noticeable benefits in medical, internet of things and many other domains.",

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",

Preserving privacy is an important issue, and higher privacy demands usually tend to require weaker identity. However, previous research has indicated that strong security tends to demand strong identity, especially in authentication processes. Thus, defining a good tradeoff between privacy and security remains a challenging problem. This motivates us to develop a privacy-preserving and accountable authentication protocol for IoT end-devices with weaker identity, which integrates an adapted construction of short group signatures and Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. We analyze the security properties of our protocol in the context of six typical attacks and verify the formal security using the Proverif tool. Experiments using our implementation in MacBook Pro and Intel Edison development platforms show that our authentication protocol is feasible in practice.",

Actisensitivity (the slope of the regression line of ambulatory BP against the log-physical activity) was higher in winter than summer.

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) systems cannot successfully realize the notion of ubiquitous connectivity of everything if they are not capable to truly include ‘multimedia things’. However, the current research and development activities in the field do not mandate the features of multimedia objects, thus leaving a gap to benefit from multimedia content based services and applications. In this paper, we analyze this issue by contemplating the concept of IoT and drawing an inspiration towards the perspective vision of ‘Internet of Multimedia Things’ (IoMT). Therein, we introduce IoMT as a novel paradigm in which smart heterogeneous multimedia things can interact and cooperate with one another and with other things connected to the Internet to facilitate multimedia based services and applications that are globally available to the users. Some applications and use-cases for IoMT are presented to reflect the possibilities enabled by this new paradigm. An IoMT architecture is then presented which is segregated into four distinct stages; (i) multimedia sensing, (ii) reporting and addressability, (iii) multimedia-aware cloud, and (iv) multi-agent systems. Instead of proposing specific technical solutions for each individual stage of the presented architecture, we survey the already existing technologies, providing a synthesis for the realization of the vision of IoMT. Subsequently, various requirements and challenges as well as the feasibility of existing solutions for each stage of proposed IoMT architecture are comprehensively discussed.",

abstract = "Although study on outlier detection techniques has long been an area of much research, few of those works relate to an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. In the last few years, with the advent of IoT and its numerous smart objects, data generated from sensors have increased exponentially. Since on the basis of these data many critical decisions are taken, it is therefore necessary to absolutely ensure its accuracy, correctness and integrity before any processing starts. Most algorithms in the past assumes outliers to be always an Error, that is caused by a malfunctioning sensor. However, this is not always true because an outlier could also be an important event that should not be neglected. This stresses the need to devise algorithms that is suited for an IoT environment which considers both Error, that is a result of faulty sensors or an Event, which is an indication of an abnormal phenomenon. This paper proposes a sequence based learning approach for outlier detection that works for both Error and Event. Simulations are performed on few benchmark datasets, a medical dataset and a real world dataset obtained through an experimental test bed. The results reveal exceptionally high accuracies with up to 99.65% for Error detection and 98.53% for Event detection.",

To solve the security issues of these protocols, we present a provably secure RFID ownership transfer protocol which achieves the security and privacy requirements for cloud-based applications. To be more specific, the communication channels among the tags, mobile readers and the cloud database are insecure. Besides, an encrypted hash table is used in the cloud database. Next, the presented protocol not only meets backward untraceability and the proposed strong forward untraceability, but also resists against replay attacks, tracing attacks, inner reader malicious impersonation attacks, tag impersonation attacks and desynchronization attacks. The comparisons of security and performance properties show that the proposed protocol has more security, higher efficiency and better scalability compared with other schemes.",

In this interconnected world, smart objects have an important role in giving users the chance for life-logging in smart environments. However, smart devices have several limitations with regards to memory, resources and computation power, hindering the opportunity to apply well-established security algorithms and techniques for secure life-logging on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The need for secure and trustworthy life-logging in smart environments is vital, thus, a lightweight approach has to be considered to overcome the constraints of Smart Objects. The purpose of this paper is to present in details the current topics of life-logging in smart environments, while describing interconnection issues, security threats and suggesting a lightweight framework for ensuring security, privacy and trustworthy life-logging. In order to investigate the efficiency of the lightweight framework and the impact of the security attacks on energy consumption, an experimental test-bed was developed including two interconnected users and one smart attacker, who attempts to intercept transmitted messages or interfere with the communication link. Several mitigation factors, such as power control, channel assignment and AES-128 encryption were applied for secure life-logging. Finally, research into the degradation of the consumed energy regarding the described intrusions is presented.",

abstract = "Progress in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is shaping more and more the healthcare domain. ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

Medical community needs to extract precise information from that large amount of data. Currently ICT approaches do not provide a methodology for content-based medical images retrieval and classification. On the other hand, from the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, the ICT medical data can be produced by several devices. Produced data complies with all Big Data features and constraints. The IoT guidelines put at the center of the system a new smart software to manage and transform Big Data in a new understanding form. This paper describes a text based indexing system for mammographic images retrieval and classification. The system deals with text (structured reports) and images (mammograms) mining and classification in a typical Department of Radiology. DICOM structured reports, containing free text for medical diagnosis, have been analyzed and labeled in order to classify the corresponding mammographic images. Information Retrieval process is based on some text manipulation techniques, such as light semantic analysis, stop-word removing, and light medical natural language processing. The system includes also a Search Engine module, based on a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of Specificity and Sensibility. Two more indexes have been computed in order to assess the system robustness: the Az (Area under ROC Curve) index and the σAz (Az standard error) index. The dataset is composed of healthy and pathological DICOM structured reports. Two use case scenarios are presented and described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

These scenarios were developed and applied for two cases, namely the aerospace sector and the construction sector, analysing the effect of AM on each phase in the value chain. In the aerospace sector, energy savings of 5–25% can be made, with the largest effect in the use phase because of weight reduction. In the construction sector, energy savings of 4–21% are achievable, with the largest effects in the feedstock, transport and use phases. Extrapolated to the global energy demand in 2050, a reduction of 26–138EJ/yr, equivalent to 5–27% of global demand is achievable. It is recommended that energy policymakers should consider integrating AM and other disruptive technologies, such as robotics and the Internet of Things, into their long-term energy planning, policies and programmes, including Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on climate change.",

Many of these tasks are developed in indoor environments, like industrial premises, factories and buildings. This research work proposes a novel platform to manage drones in indoor environments. The proposed platform raises to manage drones like an internet of connected devices with sensors and actuators. This platform is based on a network of connected drones which communicates with a central server. Drones can be managed by users using a web application. The application allows to define flight plans and to get the drone sensor‘s data. Drones are connected to the server using a Wi-Fi network, they exchange constantly UDP messages. Using this platform users can design flight plans using an interactive map. Flight plans can be saved and sent to a connected Drone. This platform allows users to manage drones as connected objects, running flight plans and visualizing drones’ sensor data in real time. The proposal also can be adapted to many specific industrial uses, including new sensors in the drone like, gas, temperature, radiation, etc. or some actuators like grippers or dispensers.",

With VLC, critical bio-medical signals, including electrocardiography (ECG), can be transmitted in places where RF radiation is restricted. This potential advantage of VLC could save more lives in emergency situations. A time hopping (TH) scheme is employed to transfer multiple medical-data streams in real time with a simple system design. Multiple data streams are transmitted using identical color LEDs and go into an optical detector. The received multiple data streams are demodulated and rearranged using a TH-based demodulator. The medical data is then monitored and managed to provide the necessary medical care for each patient.",

The LCPC codes do not require reiteration in the decoding process as in LDPC codes. Moreover, Simulation results show that the proposed LCPC codes outperform the Hamming, RS and LDPC codes while keeping the computational complexity very low. This leads prolonged battery lifetime due to the reduced number of retransmissions, and thus makes the LCPC more suitable for numerous emerging IoT applications.",

However, due to the sensitiveness of medical system, security and privacy issues in WBANs are very important. In previous research, there are no comprehensive authentication protocols designed for WBANs according to its characteristics of network structure. In this paper, we propose an efficient multilayer authentication protocol and a secure session key generation method for WBANs. Firstly, we design a one-to-many group authentication protocol and a group key establishment algorithm between personal digital assistance (PDA) and each of sensor nodes with energy efficiency and low computational cost. Then, we present a new certificateless authentication protocol with no pairings based on certificateless cryptography between PDA and application provider (AP), using ECC algorithm that provides low computational cost with high security. In addition, the validation of the proposed protocol can be proved. Finally, the security and performance analysis shows that our protocol is secure and efficient.",

WM involves a set of processes ranging from waste collection to the recycling of the collected materials. The proliferation of sensors and actuators enable the new era of Internet of Things (IoT) that can be adopted in SCs and help in WM. Novel approaches that involve dynamic routing models combined with the IoT capabilities could provide solutions that outperform existing models. In this paper, we focus on a SC where a number of collection bins are located in different areas with sensors attached to them. We study a dynamic waste collection architecture, which is based on data retrieved by sensors. We pay special attention to the possibility of immediate WM service in high priority areas, e.g., schools or hospitals where, possibly, the presence of dangerous waste or the negative effects on human quality of living impose the need for immediate collection. This is very crucial when we focus on sensitive groups of citizens like pupils, elderly or people living close to areas where dangerous waste is rejected. We propose novel algorithms aiming at providing efficient and scalable solutions to the dynamic waste collection problem through the management of the trade-off between the immediate collection and its cost. We describe how the proposed system effectively responds to the demand as realized by sensor observations and alerts originated in high priority areas. Our aim is to minimize the time required for serving high priority areas while keeping the average expected performance at high level. Comprehensive simulations on top of the data retrieved by a SC validate the proposed algorithms on both quantitative and qualitative criteria which are adopted to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We claim that, local authorities could choose the model that best matches their needs and resources of each city.",

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure. Improved accuracies of classifiers on U2R and R2L attacks have been recorded in the experimental results obtained for experiments conducted.",

abstract = "The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased the appetite for the energy efficient wireless infrastructures. Most of the IoT devices are inherently resource constrained and heterogeneous in respect of their traffic demand. Moreover, these devices need to be made adaptable to the varying environmental conditions. However, existing traffic scheduling and duty cycling algorithms lack the capability to meet the dynamic service quality requirements of IoT applications with variable context information. Specifically, they are infeasible for IoT use-cases where multi-hop communication is required. This paper strives to realize efficient resource allocation to the Wi-Fi based IoT devices in multi-hop IoT infrastructures. Firstly, IoT applications are characterized as per their heterogeneous traffic demand and mapped to the distinct weighted quality classes. Then, context awareness is introduced for IoT devices and an optimization model constrained by their service quality requirements and context priorities is presented. Further, an energy efficient context aware traffic scheduling (EE-CATS) algorithm is proposed wherein the convergence of model is specified by a sub-gradient projection method. The EE-CATS algorithm efficiently allocates resources to multi-hop IoT devices and reduce their total awake time by employing adaptive duty cycling. The performance evaluation is done for various IoT use-cases through simulations in Network Simulator (ns-2) and testbed implementation in Contiki operating system. The results suggest substantial improvements in the energy efficiency of IoT devices while ensuring their dynamic service requirements. In addition, the proposed algorithm minimizes the end-to-end delays in overall IoT networks.",

In this study, we use “Tech Mining,” a systematic analytical method based on structured texts applied to publication and patent abstract data, to analyze potential applications of TENGs. A series of applications from product scale to industry scale are identified. The findings show that when used as sensors, TENGs are mostly applicable in automation and energy-intensive industries such as automotive, medical or surgical devices, consumer electronics and household appliances. TENGs in the form of sensors can also be integrated with future-oriented and exponentially growing technologies such as robotics, drones, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics that will create enormous value for future economies. Moreover, applications of TENGs as sensors are also in line with current global trends of science and technology development, including the “Internet of Things,” big data, clean energy, and smart cities. Combined with those technologies and industries, TENGs can help in tackling challenges of global warming, environmental pollution and security systems. We suggest the TENG research community to widen interdisciplinary collaboration, pursue connections with industry, and file more patents as R&D progresses.

abstract = "Tactile sensors, most commonly referred as strain and pressure sensors, can collect mechanical property data of the human body and local environment, to provide valuable insights into the human health status or artificial intelligence systems. The introduction of a high level of wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects, providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary curved surface over their stiff counterparts without incurring damage, emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force, temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization), further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory, signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major research frontiers in recent years. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art wearable tactile sensors concerning basic concepts, functional materials, sensing mechanism, promising applications, performance optimization strategies, multifunctional sensing, and system integration. Finally, the discussion will be presented regarding potential challenges, pathways, and opportunities.",

A possible solution to reduce healthcare costs in a world that is aging is the adoption of telehealth technologies. Several solutions appeared, in the past suggesting the use of smart devices (mobile phones or tablets) for supporting telehealth. Unfortunately, elderly people may have difficulties in the use of such devices even if user interfaces are becoming friendly and intuitive. This work introduces the concept of “Smartstone”, that is the use of a (low-cost) smartphone as a simple, effective, and portable gateway/edge server for mobile healthcare towards cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The Smartstone is designed in order to minimize the user interaction, thanks to its autonomous behavior. The adoption of smart devices as a building block ensures state-of-the-art connectivity and relatively high computational power, complemented by an ensemble of additional onboard sensors. In particular, results about the management of a new photoplethysmographic /bio-impedance monitor and a smart pill dispenser are presented in this work.",

The scheme proposed in this paper can protect an IoT solution against several attacks like data breach, Denial of Service (DoS) and unauthorized access.

A diode connected MOSFET forward bias technique is employed to minimize the body leakage and improve the noise performance. A notch filter isolator with harmonic rejection is constructed to improve the linearity of low voltage.

While previous research shows that business model affects the performance of entrepreneurial firms, there is still limited understanding about how likely different business model selections of Internet of Things (IoT) startup firms retain their value and whether the venture capital investment intensity does play any role in the business model’s value retention process. In this study, we suggest that the e-business model selections (i.e. novelty, efficiency, lock-in and complementarity) of an IoT mobile Application (App) may affect its value retention. Based on contingency theory, an organization must match its structure and decisions to its external environments. We propose that the venture capitalist’s involvement may moderate the strength of the relationship between e-business models and an IoT mobile App’s’ value retention. We have collected data from 470 start-ups in China. The results show that efficiency-centred and complementarities-centred e-business models increase while lock-in centred e-business model reduces the IoT mobile App’s value retention. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that the venture capitalist’s involvement does not help all types of e-business model’s value retention. The relationship between novelty centred e-business model and value retention is positively only when venture capital investment intensity is high. In contrast, the relationship between efficiency centred e-business model and value retention is positive only when venture capital investment intensity is low. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, and some limitations and future research directions are proposed.",

abstract = "In this paper, a secure and efficient authentication and authorization architecture for IoT-based healthcare is developed. Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based DTLS handshake protocol as it is the main IP security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a TI SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The CC2538 module integrated into the TI board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.",

The new wave of artificial super intelligence, exemplified by the evolution in big data and Internet of Things raise an issue of whether this evolution could and should exclude human intuition from human judgment, given its exclusive reliance on data driven certainty of algorithms, analytics, artificial and machine learning. How could we respond to the algorithmic wave of uneven accuracy, deal with uncertainty, ambiguity, conflicts, justifiable judgements, and seek alignment of data and knowledge. We are minded by Weizenbaum's argument (1976) that if human judgement is based on human observation (data) and intuition, then how can science which ultimately rests on a vast array of human value judgments, deny that human value judgments are illusionary? The paper reflects on the certainty of data driven singularity and argues for a relational conversation between technology and society.",

Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and private, will access a web of interconnected data from GPS location to weather and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges.

Maturing trends were found to share influential common topics identified by high degree, betweenness and closeness centrality scores. Niche and potentially emerging trends within groups were detected by means of eccentricity and farness metrics. Visualisation techniques were found effective for further clarification and trend identification. Finally, potentially disruptive trends within domains were found to be associated with high closeness paired with low degree centrality. The findings were distilled into a framework for assisting the forecasting of potentially disruptive trends.",

Nanogenerators were first developed for self-powered systems based on piezoelectric effect and triboelectrification effect for converting tiny mechanical energy into electricity, which have applications in internet of things, environmental/infrastructural monitoring, medical science and security. In this paper, we present the fundamental theory of the nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations. In the Maxwell's displacement current, the first term ε0∂E∂t gives the birth of electromagnetic wave, which is the foundation of wireless communication, radar and later the information technology. Our study indicates that the second term ∂P∂t in the Maxwell's displacement current is directly related to the output electric current of the nanogenerator, meaning that our nanogenerators are the applications of Maxwell's displacement current in energy and sensors. By contrast, electromagnetic generators are built based on Lorentz force driven flow of free electrons in a conductor. This study presents the similarity and differences between pieozoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, as well as the classical electromagnetic generator, so that the impact and uniqueness of the nanogenerators can be clearly understood. We also present the three major applications of nanogenerators as micro/nano-power source, self-powered sensors and blue energy.",

Although there are many proposals for handling real-time traffic in WSNs, most of them fall into best-effort mechanisms that do not provide real-time guarantees. At the MAC level, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines a reservation mechanism called Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) that uses a first-come first-served service policy, which is not enough to ensure the real-time delivery of packets. In this work, we present a formal definition of the scheduling problem for a sensor network using a reservation mechanism (such as GTS) that provides guarantees for the real-time delivery of packets. We also present a heuristic approach for finding feasible schedules when possible or determining if the requirements of a set of sensors are not feasible.",

We compare iDoctor with previous healthcare recommendation methods using real datasets. The experimental results show that iDoctor provides a higher predication rating and increases the accuracy of healthcare recommendation significantly.",

abstract = "The future of logistics shipping bases will be to seek efficient flows of materials to meet the needs of business partners. Supply chain and operations managers of supply bases will need to integrate technologies that allow for greater automation, digitalization, flexibility and improved communications among stakeholders. The technologies that are likely to boost integration will consist of a plethora of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) technologies that may include Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and could be applied for improved monitoring of healthy and safe industrial workplaces for workers. However, little is known regarding how WSN technologies can be implemented on a larger scale and its implications when integrated on standard logistics and operations of industrial workplaces such as a shipping base. The WSN sensor units represent an integrating resource that are capable of monitoring air temperature, humidity and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gasses and of disseminating this information to different actors in the production system. Air quality factors play a critical role in the perceived levels of workers' comfort and in reported medical health. The low cost of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies offer potential for continuous, autonomous and importantly networked assessment of industrial workplace air quality that may have implications for operations management and quality of production. This paper initially presents a case study that monitors air quality that is collected with WSN technologies from two workshops carried out by a large on-shore logistics base that supports offshore petroleum logistics. The case study demonstrates a monitoring and visualization approach for facilitating BD in decision making for health and safety in the shipping industry. However, with the advancement in IIoT technologies and the emergence of smart sensing and actuating devices, it is possible to form a digital closed-loop system that we argue is essential for managers to link together information about air quality with supply chain and operations management decisions. We propose that central to effective decision making is the data analytics approach and visualization of what is potentially, big data (BD) in monitoring the air quality in industrial workplaces. We discuss how WSN technologies can be integrated into the logistics management and operations of the shipping base. Through an analytical discussion of BD we explore how to extend the potential application of IIoT and Visual Analytics to facilitate a smart workplace for the Industry 4.0 era.",

However, in reality, there are scenarios where the locations of users are identical or similar/near each other in IoT. In such scenarios the k locations selected by k-anonymity technique are the same and location privacy can be easily compromised or leaked. To address the issue of privacy preservation, in this paper, we introduce the location labels to distinguish locations of mobile users to sensitive and ordinary locations. We design a location-label based (LLB) algorithm for protecting location privacy of users while minimizing the response time for LBS requests.

The way that is eminently to accomplish concurrency is to build an object-oriented environment with support for messages passing between concurrent objects. Node.js, a cross-platform runtime environment features technologies for handling concurrency issue efficiently for Remote Healthcare Monitoring System. The experiments results show that server-side JavaScript with Node.js and MongoDB as database is 40% faster than Apache Sling.

This research aims to evaluate the BIS maturity and its influences on decision quality to reveal the BIS impacts on hospital agility. To test the research model, opinions were collected by distributing questionnaires to clinical and administrative decision-makers who had experiences of using BIS in hospitals.

In smart cities, numerous IoT-based services are likely to be available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the environment’s services and their functionalities as Semantic Web Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of IoT domains. In this paper, we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature, specification (i.e., context-aware pre-conditions, post-conditions and effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches.",

As such they become part of everyday life and drive applications as diverse as medical monitoring, smart homes, smart environment, and smart factories, to name but a few. To acquire data, individual sensors interact with the physical environment by sensing physical phenomena in proximity. The wireless network connectivity is leveraged to collect the raw data or pre-processed events, and to disseminate code, queries or commands. Actuating capabilities facilitate instant interactions with the environment or application processes. Experience on how to operate large scale heterogeneous WSNs in (critical) real-world applications is still scarce, and operational considerations are often an afterthought to WSN deployment. A principled look into the metrics, i.e., a standard or best practice of measurement of the ‘vital’ parameters in WSNs is still missing. In this article, we contribute a survey on the most important metrics to characterize the performance of WSNs. We define an abstract system model for WSNs, take a look on what the WSN community considers ‘metrics that matter’, and categorize the metrics into scopes of relevance. We discuss the properties of the metrics as well as practical aspects on how to obtain and process them. Our survey can serve as a ‘manual’ for implementors and operators of WSNs in the IoT.",

This protocol is supposed to work in the networks with high traffic because multiple sources try to send their packets to a destination at the same time, which is a typical scenario in IoT applications for remote healthcare monitoring. For selecting the next hop node, the algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of three factors: signal to interference and noise ratio of the link, the survivability factor the path from the next hop node to the destination, and the congestion level at the next hop node. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol works better concerning the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and the remaining energy level of the nodes. The rate of packet drops is also observed to be lesser in the congested topology scenarios.",

abstract = "Body Sensor Network (BSN) is a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) application for personalized health care. It consists of economically powered, wireless and implanted medical monitoring sensor nodes, which are designed to continually collect the medical information of the target patients. Multichannel is often used in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes and the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention. The health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink node (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health emergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for multichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to meet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links. As a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the scheduled lossy links. Besides, potential collisions in the schedules also incur considerable delay in delivering the sensing data. In this paper, we propose a novel deadline-driven Link quality Aware Channel Assignment scheme (LACA), where link quality, deadlines and collisions are jointly considered. LACA prioritizes links with urgent deadlines and heavy collisions. Besides, LACA allows the exploitation of the spare slots for retransmissions on lossy links, which can further reduce the retransmission delay. Extensive simulation experiments show that compared to the existing approaches, LACA can better utilize the wireless spectrum and achieve higher packet delivery ratio before the deadline.",

K-hop reachability query answering in graphs is seeing a growing number of applications, such as ranked keyword search in databases, social networking, ontology reasoning and bioinformatics. Currently, techniques for efficient evaluation of such queries are based on vertex-cover technology. These methods suffer from a lack of scalability; that is, they cannot be applied to very large graphs. To solve these problems, we propose the compound-index method, namely BFSI-B, which uses the special index to decrease the k-hop reachability query time and improve pruning efficiency. The theoretical analysis and experiment results demonstrate that our method has a smaller index size and a faster query time than the k-reach method, in both dense graphs and very large graphs.",

Both Internet of Things (IoT) and Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are major applications of 5G networks. However, over-consumption of energy for device discovery, which includes registration, removal, querying, routing etc, quickly depletes the resources of a node, which may further influence the whole network. There are a number of approaches which provide energy efficient mechanisms for the selection of devices in a network operating with different types of nodes; however, these approaches are unable to maintain a high transmission capacity along with energy conservation and fault-tolerance. In this paper, an energy efficient approach for device discovery in 5G-based IoT and BSNs using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is presented. A functional architecture is proposed, which utilizes XML charts to perform device discovery on the basis of networks state cost and available energy. The significant gains achieved in energy consumption, end to end delays and packet loss show that our solution is capable of providing energy efficient device discovery with 78.4% reduction in the overall energy consumption compared to existing solutions. The advantage of UAVs in energy efficient networking is illustrated using numerical analysis which suggests 75% enhancement in the energy-asymptote of the existing networks.",

Organizations too often make a decision that will produce a positive consequence and then focus on how to implement it, rarely stepping back to ask “What else could happen?” Any decision changes the system in which it exists. The longer the time required to implement a decision, the more systemic changes can alter the effects of the decision on the system. Decisions to implement Corporate Social Responsibility and sustainability initiatives usually involve many different stakeholders and may involve systems in which organizations have little expertise or experience. A major negative unintended consequence, even for a CSR initiative, can damage the stakeholders’ trust in the organization.

The huge amount of data generated for these systems require high computing capabilities only available in Data Centers.

Low-power techniques are applied in monitorization nodes. Techniques such us: on-node signal processing and radio policies to make node’s autonomy longer and save energy, have been applied. Workload balancing policies are carried out in the coordinator nodes and Data Centers to reduce the computational burden in these facilities and minimize its energy consumption. Our results draw average savings of € 288 million in this eHealth scenario applied only to 2% of European migraine sufferers; in addition to savings of € 1272 million due to the benefits of the migraine prediction.",

For example, the world witnesses 15 million stroke patients each year. These individuals face a number of gait abnormalities including drop foot that is a pathological condition, limiting patients’ ability to lift the foot from the ground during the swing phase of walking. In this research work, we introduce a novel smart textile system, MagicSox that is woven with multiple sensors distributed over the surface of the foot. The overarching goal of MagicSox is to quantify the gait abnormalities in remote settings such as patients’ homes so that clinicians and physical therapists can assess their patients on daily basis. The paper provides a detailed architecture of MagicSox that leverages the computing and communication capabilities of a modern internet of things (IoT) processor, Intel Curie. We have developed an Android smartphone app that uses Bluetooth low energy and automates the multi-sensor data collection from MagicSox. In the algorithmic front, we adopted multiplication of backward differences (MOBD) to analyze the multi-modal time series data to distinguish drop foot events from normal walking cycles. We pursued a usability study on healthy participants who were asked to walk normally and also to simulate drop foot cycles. We developed support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to analyze the data. The classification resulted in the accuracy of drop foot detection varying from 71.78%−98.38%. The promising results now encourage us to evaluate MagicSox on stroke patients in future studies.",

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation.",

abstract = "Fast and secure object monitoring and management using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies is crucial to Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Structured key-based private authentication protocols securely identify individual RF tags in the logarithmic order by having group keys shared by several tags. However, should some portion of tags in the system be physically compromised, the degree of privacy of the other tags will decrease. This is because tampered group keys disclosed from the compromised tags can be correlated. Thus, preserving the degree of tags’ privacy in keeping with fast authentication speed is equivalent to reducing the correlation probability of group keys. Toward this goal, we propose Randomized Skip Graphs-Based Authentication (RSGA) that significantly improves the tags’ privacy in terms of anonymity with reasonable amount of key storage cost by using a skip graph key structure. Then, we augment RSGA with a key updating mechanism to securely update secret keys and a path pruning algorithm to further facilitate its authentication process. Our extensive computer simulation as well as mathematical analyses present that the proposed RSGA achieves its design goals.",

In addition to this, it is inherently difficult and time consuming for gastroenterologists to analyze this huge volume of gastrointestinal video data for desired contents. To surmount these issues, we propose a secure video summarization framework for outdoor patients going through WCE procedure. In the proposed system, keyframes are extracted using a light-weighted video summarization scheme, making it more suitable for WCE. Next, a cryptosystem is presented for security of extracted keyframes based on 2D Zaslavsky chaotic map.

abstract = "Big data has arrived. Myriad applications, systems generate data of humongous volumes, variety and velocity which traditional computing systems and databases are unable to manage. The proliferation of sensors in every possible device is also becoming one of the major generators of Big data. Of particular interest in this article is how context aware computing systems which derive context from data and act accordingly, deal with such huge amounts of data. Big industry players namely Google, Yahoo, and Amazon are already developing context aware applications using user data from emails, chat messages, browsing and shopping histories etc. For instance, Gmail reminds us of our flight schedule by understanding flight booking related content in our emails. Similarly, Amazon understands user preference and recommends items of interest to shop and so on. In this paper, we survey context aware computing systems from a Big data perspective. We first propose a taxonomy of existing work on the basis of sensing platforms and then discuss the latest developments in this field of Big data context aware systems focusing on how such systems deal with various Big data challenges. We conclude the paper with an insight on open research issues involving designing and developing context aware Big data generating systems.",

A smart city operates using large numbers of networked sensors to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in near-real time; these data may also have secondary applications. This study proposes one such use of the data gathered by home energy management systems (HEMS). Current HEMS focus mainly on energy efficiency, but residents typically value indoor comfort as well. HEMS collect various types of data that can be used to create an index for short-term indoor comfort called the predicted mean vote (PMV). This study implements a system to identify information within the stored data that is relevant to reducing electricity consumption while maintaining indoor comfort according to each resident’s PMV preference. The system was tested in three households in Japan for 12 days in winter. The system reduced electricity consumption by 5.15% and increased the comfort satisfaction expressed as PMV by 42.3%. Qualitative assessments of indoor comfort increased by 16.4%. Providing users with information selected according to their PMV preferences was more effective in reducing electricity consumption and increasing indoor comfort than providing them with random information.",

The sensor is suitable for wireless applications, it consists of two stub resonators on kapton in order to provide a differential detection. The final aim of this work is to develop a low cost communicating sensor which can be integrated into real time multi sensing platform dedicated to the applications requiring low power consumption and adaptable for the Internet of Things (IoT), in order to do the detection of harmful gases such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Preliminary results have shown a large influence of ethanol concentration on the electrical properties of the passive resonators at radio-frequency range. These vapors have induced additional insertion losses and frequency shifts on the first resonant frequency mode around 0.65GHz. The sensor sensitivity to ethanol vapors exposition has been estimated to −642.9Hz/ppm and −7μdB/ppm for resonant frequency and insertion losses variations in differential mode, respectively, according to the values at 4min of exposure to 500, 1000 and 2000ppm. To deepen the study of the sensor, we have focused on the influence of ethanol on the conductivity of the sensitive layer, in terms of repeatability and sensitivity. We proposed a way of real-time reconstruction of the response by representing the difference of the insertion losses as well as the difference of frequencies calculated on the basis of the phase average value within a specified frequency range near the resonance. This lead to estimate a sensitivity of −9μdB/ppm and 648.1Hz/ppm, respectively, for ethanol concentrations ranging from 500ppm to 2000ppm at 10min of exposure.",

With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.",

With the recent development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a need of mobile-targeted facial expression verification, where face scrambling has been proposed for privacy protection during image/video distribution over public network. Consequently, facial expression verification needs to be carried out in a scrambled domain, bringing out new challenges in facial expression recognition. An immediate impact from face scrambling is that conventional semantic facial components become not identifiable, and 3D face models cannot be clearly fitted to a scrambled image. Hence, the classical facial action coding system cannot be applied to facial expression recognition in the scrambled domain. To cope with chaotic signals from face scrambling, this paper proposes an new approach – Many Graph Embedding (MGE) to discover discriminative patterns from the subspaces of chaotic patterns, where the facial expression recognition is carried out as a fuzzy combination from many graph embedding. In our experiments, the proposed MGE was evaluated on three scrambled facial expression datasets: JAFFE, MUG and CK++. The benchmark results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to improve the recognition accuracy, making our method a promising candidate for the scrambled facial expression recognition in the emerging privacy-protected IoT applications.",

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.",

This model is used to recommend medicine with side effects for different symptoms collected from heterogeneous IoT sensors. Two datasets are taken for the analysis of big-data. One dataset contains diseases with drug details and the second dataset contains medicines with side effects. Information between physician and patient are semantically annotated and transferred in a meaningful way. A Lightweight Model for Semantic annotation of Big-data using heterogeneous devices in IoT is proposed to provide annotations for big data. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic web framework that is recycled to communicate things using Triples to make it semantically significant. RDF annotated patients’ data and made it semantically interoperable. SPARQL query is used to extract records from RDF graph.

In this sense, KASOM implements mechanisms and protocols which allow managing the knowledge generated in pervasive embedded networks in order to expose it to Internet users in a readable way. General functional requirements of embedded sensor and actuator platforms have been taken into account when designing KASOM, with special attention in energy consumption, memory and bandwidth. The KASOM evaluation and validation will be demonstrated through a real Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network deployment based on integral healthcare services in a sanatorium.",

But, the private information from IoT devices is stored in distributed private cloud server so that only legitimate users are allowed to access the sensitive information from the cloud server. Keeping focus on all these points, this article first shows security vulnerabilities of the multi-server cloud environment of the protocols proposed by Xue et al. and Chuang et al. Then, we propose an architecture which is applicable for distributed cloud environment and based on it, an authentication protocol using smartcard has been proposed, where the registered user can access all private information securely from all the private cloud servers. To strengthen the proposed protocol, we have used AVISPA tool and BAN logic model in this article. Moreover, an informal cryptanalysis confirms that the protocol is protected against all possible security threats. The performance analysis and comparison confirm that the proposed protocol is superior than its counterparts with respect to various parameters.",

The varied deposition conditions include glancing angle, vacuum level and deposition rate. The electrical property of In2O3 nanostructured thin films, demonstrated by the base resistance, change up to 3 orders of magnitude from 110Ω to 103104Ω depending on the porosity of nanocolumnar structure and oxygen vacancy concentration. This variation in electrical property transfers to the tuning of gas sensing response, and we achieve tuning the same material (In2O3) based gas sensors to better perform for specific type of gases (either oxidizing or reducing). The highest responses achieved in this work reached up to 176 for oxidizing gases (5ppm NO2, Rgas/Rair) and 929 for reducing gases (50ppmC2H5OH, Rair/Rgas). Therefore, we demonstrate that gas sensors can be optimized for specific type of target gases with the same material, via simple control of deposition conditions. Along with the high reproduciblility and sensitivity, this puts the nanocolumnar thin film based gas sensors by GLAD with huge potential for further miniaturization and mass production, suitable for the upcoming IoT era.",

abstract = "The building of the Future Internet is well on its way with many research projects and experimental development activities in different parts of the works. However the debate over different approaches is still ongoing. Much of the comparison is concentrating on the different technical capabilities, however, very little effort has been put on finding out how such capabilities will actually be used by the different stakeholders and in particular by users and service providers. Decisions such as whether to take an evolutionary step with TCP/IP, start to use cellular protocols, or develop something new, should be based on realistic and validated user scenarios clearly highlighting what might be needed in the future and indicating a prioritised roadmap. As the Future Internet is needed for supporting new applications and services, it is natural that the requirements for Future Internet should come from the future applications. In this paper, we take a look at a likely future to see what kind of applications can be expected. We then analyse some potential future applications trying to understand the key features the Future Internet should support in order to meet key challenging requirements. Finally, we compare the requirements with the existing Future Internet research, in order to see how they match to each other.",

Its guiding principles are to enhance industrial capability through innovation-driven manufacturing, optimize the structure of Chinese industry, emphasize quality over quantity, train and attract talent, and achieve green manufacturing and environment. Data show that currently China is no longer the lowest–cost labor market; it is being squeezed by newly emerging low-cost producers such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Meanwhile, China is not the strongest player in the high-tech arena; well-established industrialized nations, the US, Germany, and Japan, have all effectively deployed digital technology to create new industrial environments, produce new products, and improve their well-established brands. Having analyzed the data from the World Bank and China's National Bureau of Statistics, we find an upward trajectory in China in manufacturing capability development, research and development commitment, and human capital investment. However, implementing an ambitious strategic plan such as “Made-in-China 2025” is coupled with challenges. This research helps us understand the relationship between technological entrepreneurship and socio-economic changes in emerging economies such as China. Furthermore, the experience accumulated in China can be referenced by both emerging economies and developed nations to advance their technological entrepreneurship.",

In the first stage, a master device sends a signal to each tag devices in order to confirm the communication ability status. In the second stage, the master device sends another signal to the confirmed tags to initiate ranging and positioning. The efficiency of the proposed management algorithm compared to conventional method is proved by experiments in ordinary classroom which exemplifies indoor coverage in buildings.",

abstract = "‘The Digital Citizen’ has become a buzzword in recent years as part of the social and economic agendas of many countries and as a key theme in the strategy for Europe 2020. In 2014, the Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, described its emergence as “people with greater access to information, people empowered to shape the world around them. More able to both learn: and participate”.1 Yet, while the benefits of this vision are clear, harnessing the opportunities on offer requires confronting significant challenges. In seeking to explore what this empowering concept means for law and policy-makers today, this Seminar is intended to encourage reflection upon how increasing digitisation and hyper-connectivity affects our day-to-day interactions with those in power, as well as the security and privacy issues arising from them. For example, in many countries the development of new forms of digital identity management enables citizens to assert their identity electronically in order to access public services (such as online access to their medical data). However, these can only work optimally when supported by citizen-centric policy and legal frameworks that are technology-neutral, trust enhancing and mutually recognised across borders. New data-driven and virtual relationships with governments also necessitate a reconsideration of the rights that digital citizen deserve. On the one hand, the ease with which increasing amounts of accessible personal data can be collected – overtly or covertly – and analysed by states about their citizens' raises concerns about lost privacy controls and substantial power imbalances (such as regarding storage and access rights to such data). On the other hand, massive improvements in accessing information permit opportunities for greater engagement with government by individuals, yet assume the rollout of better and faster internet connectivity for all citizens to participate. In turn, social media has demonstrated how ICT can facilitate collective citizen activism to pressure for societal change, alongside the power of sousveillance to act as a countervailing force to pervasive state monitoring. Also ripe for discussion is the notion of reciprocal responsibilities between citizens and governments. In the physical space, for example, concerns are mounting over the implications of the advent of cheap wearable computers and drones. In the virtual domain, the borderless nature of the online world and its distributed control has connotations for a wider concept of networked citizenship with attendant rights. This led the creator of the Web – Sir Tim Berners-Lee – to call for a Bill of Rights (a ‘Magna Carta for the Web’) in 2014, the Web's 25th birthday, to protect its users. Citizen rights that already exist relevant to the online environment are scattered across various laws and are not always easy to understand. The roles of transnational institutions in fostering closer international cooperation on ICT policy, as well as strengthening confidence in privacy, consumer and data protection rights online, are also topics for discussion in this respect. Questions for discussion include: What does digital citizenship mean today? What rights, obligations and responsibilities should be associated with digital citizenship? What types of legal solutions are fit for purpose to protect digital citizenship interests? What should be the role of public sectors in e-identity assurance schemes, such as regarding liability? Should e-identity management be regulated? How does digital citizenship relate to novel rights, such as a right to public-sector data and a right to be forgotten online, and how might these rights be enforced effectively? To what extent can law and policy support increase transparency and trust by citizens in the actions of their governments? How can privacy and security be guaranteed to citizens where automated technologies affect their rights and civil liberties? How are biometrics and location-tracking devices used by states in body surveillance changing the digital citizenship landscape? How can individuals be more empowered to control their personal data held by governments and give informed consent to its use? What are the global drivers of digital citizenship policies and international cooperation in rule making and standard setting, especially in relation to emerging sensor-embedded technologies that will change the lives of citizens dramatically in the future?",

However, more specialized target applications to biomedical and wearable devices will require biocompatible and eco-friendly triboelectric materials in power generators. Herein, we report for the first time a bio-triboelectric nanogenerator based on an eco-friendly and naturally abundant biomaterial, bacterial nanocellulose. Initially, bacterial cellulose pellicles were produced in a gel state by Acetobacter xylinum KJ1 in the Glu-Fruc medium and then a bacterial nanocellulose film having transparent and flexible functionalities was regenerated on a current collector via a solubilization process. The bacterial nanocellulose triboelectric nanogenerator was investigated with various input conditions and structural aspects. The working mechanism was also considered by measuring the contact angle and the surface potential of the friction materials. We believe that this study provides new insights to advancing the biocompatible and eco-friendly triboelectric power generator and optimization strategies to achieve high performance of triboelectric nanogenerators.",

In this context, Privacy-Preserving Tabular Data Publishing (PPTDP) has drawn considerable attention, where different approaches have been proposed to preserve the privacy of individuals' tabular data. Such data can include Single Sensitive Attributes (SSA) or Multiple Sensitive Attributes (MSA) or come from data streams. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to analyze and evaluate the main different data anonymization approaches that have been introduced in PPTDP. The study investigates the three broad areas of research: SSA, MSA and data streams. A detailed criticism is presented to highlight the strengths and the weaknesses of each approach including their deployment in the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. A research gap analysis is discussed with a focus on capturing current state of the art in this field in order to highlight the future directions that can be considered.",

Context refers to the particular settings that give additional information on the reasons behind the set of data that is obtained and its value to the end user. Context is often derived through inferences and reasoning techniques, the aim being disambiguation, reducing doubts, and improve confidence levels. In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare. The context broker that is presented in this paper addresses some critical healthcare issues: availability, cost and quality. This broker is for general and specialised healthcare needs in specific medical fields, and it is especially useful in emergency situations. It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria. The context broker collects queries from users (patients or their dependents), and refers them to the best and most affordable hospitals on the basis of their geographical location, financial status, quality of care and the availability of the requested medical services at the time their request is made.",

Further, handling of these datasets has become one of the biggest challenges for the research community due to the involved heterogeneity in their formats. This can be attributed to their diverse sources of generation ranging from sensors to on-line transactions data and social media access. In this direction, probabilistic data structures (PDS) are suitable for large-scale data processing, approximate predictions, fast retrieval and unstructured data storage. In conventional databases, entire data needs to be stored in memory for efficient processing, but applications involving real time in-stream data demand time-bound query output in a single pass. Hence, this paper proposes Accommodative Bloom filter (ABF), a variant of scalable bloom filter, where insertion of bulk data is done using the addition of new filters vertically. Array of m bits is divided into b buckets of l bits each and new filters of size ‘m∕k′ are added to each bucket to accommodate the incoming data. Data generated from various sensors has been considered for experimental purposes where query processing is done at two levels to improve the accuracy and reduce the search time. It has been found that insertion and search time complexity of ABF does not increase with increase in number of elements. Further, results indicate that ABF outperforms the existing variants of Bloom filters in terms of false positive rates and query complexity, especially when dealing with in-stream data.",

abstract = "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology has opened a whole new dimension of single-hop wireless communication technology due to its inexpensive and low-power properties. This technology makes it possible for a large number of devices to be connected to the Internet of Things. The BLE mechanism is clearly defined by the standard, however, there is room for improvements in some aspects of the technology such as the discovery process. Although the discovery process of traditional Bluetooth architecture has been intensively investigated through analytical and simulation models over the years, it cannot be applied to the BLE technology because of many changes introduced in the design of the BLE. Recently, there have been several works for performance evaluation of BLE discovery process, but they are not still thorough enough in providing a holistic analysis of the BLE. This has motivated our study for more accurate modeling of the BLE discovery process. Our work focuses on developing an analytical model and carrying out intensive simulations to investigate discovery probability and quantitative examination of the influence of parameter settings on the discovery latency and the energy performance metric of the discovery process.",

In such complex circumstances, the perception of interoperability needs to evolve from the consideration of interoperating pairs of systems to the capability of an autonomous system to sense, interpret, understand and act upon arbitrary messages received from a potentially unknown sender. In this sense, interoperability becomes in fact a property of the system. In this paper, we elaborate on an evolved concept of interoperability in context of ubiquitous healthcare systems. Then, we identify the enabling factors for the interoperable systems involved in pervasive healthcare and assess the impact the Interoperability as a Property (IaaP) paradigm would have on the healthcare landscape and challenges.",

The applications span large domains including mobile digital health, structural and environmental monitoring, smart home, energy efficient buildings, agriculture, smart cities, etc. WSN are also an important contributor to the fast emerging Internet of Things infrastructure. Some of the design specifications for WSN include reliability, accuracy, cost, deployment versatility, power consumption, etc. Power consumption is (most often) the dominant constraint in designing such systems. This constraint has multi-dimensional implications such as battery type and size, energy harvester design, lifetime of the deployment, intelligent sensing capability, etc. Power optimization techniques have to explore a large design search space. Energy neutral system implementation is the ultimate goal in wireless sensor networks ensuring a perpetual/greener use and represents a hot topic of research. Several recent advances promise significant reduction of the overall sensor network power consumption. These advances include novel sensors and sensor interfaces, low energy wireless transceivers, low power processing, efficient energy harvesters, etc. This paper reviews a number of system level power management methodologies for Wireless Sensor Networks. Especially, the paper is focusing on the promising technology of nano-Watt wake-up radio receiver and its combination with mature power management techniques to achieve better performance. Some of the presented techniques are then applied in the context of low cost and battery powered toy robots.",

A novel classifier or predicator equipped with a good feature selection function contributes effectively to classification and prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel bagging C4.5 algorithm based on wrapper feature selection, for the purpose of supporting wise clinical decision-making in the medical and healthcare fields. In particular, the new proposed sampling method, S-C4.5-SMOTE, is not only able to overcome the problem of data distortion, but also improves overall system performance because its mechanism aims at effectively reducing the data size without distortion, by keeping datasets balanced and technically smooth. This achievement directly supports the Wrapper method of effective feature selection without the need to consider the problem of huge amounts of data; this is a novel innovation in this work.",

It assumes that we can recognize the current action undertaken by the monitored subject on the basis of outputs of a set of associated sensors. Often different combinations of smart devices are being used, thus creating an Internet of Things. Such data will arrive continuously during the operation time of sensors and require an online processing in order to keep a real-time track of the current activity being undertaken. This forms a natural data stream problem with the potential presence of changes in the arriving data. Therefore, we require an efficient online machine learning system that can offer high recognition rates and adapt to drifts and shifts in the stream. In this paper we propose an efficient and lightweight adaptive ensemble learning system for real-time activity recognition. We use a weighted modification of Naïve Bayes classifier that can swiftly adapt itself to the current state of the stream without a need for an external concept drift detector. To tackle the multi-class nature of activity recognition problem we propose to use an one-vs-one decomposition to form a committee of simpler and diverse learners. We introduce a novel weighted combination for one-vs-one decomposition that can adapt itself over time. Additionally, to limit the cost of supervision we propose to enhance our classification system with active learning paradigm to select only the most important objects for labeling and work under constrained budget. Experiments carried out on six data streams gathered from ubiquitous environments show that the proposed active and adaptive ensemble offer excellent classification accuracy with low requirement for access to true class labels.",

However, most LPWAN solutions like SIGFOX™or LoRaWAN™rely on star topology networks, where stations (STAs) transmit directly to the gateway (GW), which often leads to rapid battery depletion in STAs located far from it. In this work, we analyze the impact on LPWANs energy consumption of multi-hop communication in the uplink, allowing STAs to transmit data packets in lower power levels and higher data rates to closer parent STAs, reducing their energy consumption consequently. To that aim, we introduce the Distance-Ring Exponential Stations Generator (DRESG) framework,11All of the source code in DRESG framework for LPWANs is open [1], encouraging sharing of algorithms between contributors and providing the ability for people to improve on the work of others under the GNU General Public License v3.0. designed to evaluate the performance of the so-called optimal-hop routing model, which establishes optimal routing connections in terms of energy efficiency, aiming to balance the consumption among all the STAs in the network. Results show that enabling such multi-hop connections entails higher network lifetimes, reducing significantly the bottleneck consumption in LPWANs with up to thousands of STAs. These results lead to foresee multi-hop communication in the uplink as a promising routing alternative for extending the lifetime of LPWAN deployments.",

There is a serious problem in that radiated noise via the human body emitted from an electric light or peripheral electronic equipment is likely to be transmitted along the same path as a signal by capacitance coupling. We investigated a channel model and estimated radiated noise via the human body based on experiments and circuit simulation. The validity of the channel model was clarified from noise measurement. When an additional electrode was connected to a ground electrode in a measurement system for a practical scene, the noise reduction rating was 5.11dB. However, actually, reducing the noise is difficult. Therefore, reducing the noise source in such a communication is necessary.",

In this paper, a secure weighted possibilistic c-means algorithm based on the BGV encryption scheme is proposed for big data clustering on cloud. Specially, BGV is used to encrypt the raw data for the privacy preservation on cloud. Furthermore, the Taylor theorem is used to approximate the functions for calculating the weight value of each object and updating the membership matrix and the cluster centers as the polynomial functions which only include addition and multiplication operations such that the weighed possibilistic c-means algorithm can be securely and correctly performed on the encrypted data in cloud. Finally, the presented scheme is estimated on two big datasets, i.e., eGSAD and sWSN, by comparing with the traditional weighted possibilistic c-means method in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and scalability. The results show that the presented scheme performs more efficiently than the traditional weighted possiblistic c-means algorithm and it achieves a good scalability on cloud for big data clustering.",

Among various types of harvesting sources such as light, vibration and radio frequency, thermoelectric generators (TEG) are a promising option due to their independence of light conditions or the activity of the wearer. This work investigates scavenging of human body heat and the optimization of the power conversion efficiency from body core to the application. We focus on the critical interaction between thermal harvester and power conditioning circuitry and compare two approaches: (1) a high output voltage, low thermal resistance μTEG combined with a high efficiency actively controlled single inductor DC-DC converter, and (2) a high thermal resistance, low electric resistance mTEG in combination with a low-input voltage coupled inductors based DC-DC converter. The mTEG approach delivers up to 65% higher output power per area in a lab setup and 1–15% in a real-world experiment on the human body depending on physical activity and environmental conditions. Using off-the-shelf and low-cost components, we achieve an average power of 260μW (μTEG) to 280μW (mTEG) and power densities of 13μWcm−2 (μTEG) to 14μWcm−2 (mTEG) for systems worn on the human wrist. With the small and lightweight harvesters optimized for wearability, 16% (mTEG) to 24% (μTEG) of the theoretical maximum efficiency is achieved in a worst-case scenario. This efficiency highly depends on the application specific conditions and requires careful system design.

abstract = "In this paper, we specifically address the problem of securing distributed multimedia systems, based on networked tiny devices (i.e., Internet of Things). Such systems have usually to deal with three antagonistic constraints: (a) the hardware limitations of the devices in terms of computational power, memory storage and energy provision as they are driven by batteries, (b) the intrinsic voluminous and time sensitive nature of the captured multimedia data, and (c) their relative vulnerability to attacks since they are open platforms communicating through unreliable wireless radio communications. We propose and study a novel integrated approach, specifically tailored to significantly reduce the size of the transmitted multimedia data whilst ensuring its content confidentiality. In opposition to traditional approaches, based on cryptographic systems which inquire a huge overhead when applied to multimedia data, our approach makes use of Voronoi tessellation to transform the input data. This transformation, performed on a random fashion basis, allows both significant data reduction and content confidentiality as well, while it exhibits a very low complexity. We performed an in-depth security analysis of our proposal that reveals its robustness against all known types of attacks. Moreover, we conducted an extensive series of simulations, based on realistic settings, to show the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art approaches, in the context of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) applications.",

abstract = "Currently, the increasing demands of user terminals have surged drastically and pulled up the global data traffic along. According to 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), offloading is one of the most beneficial and advantageous options to handle this critical traffic bottleneck, however, both Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) are loosely coupled. To mitigate the User Equipment (UE) from latency issues during offloading and for tighter integration of LTE and WLAN radio networks, LTE–WLAN Aggregation (LWA) was introduced by 3GPP that is apparently suitable for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, LWA is not suitable for high mobility scenarios as UEs’ information need to be updated for every new environment because of the frequent aggregation triggers which are mostly non-optimal and demands for a high-level controller. To resolve the disadvantage of non-optimal aggregation triggers, in this paper, we proposed Software Defined Networking (SDN) based approach for LWA, named as LWA under SDN Assistance (LWA-SA). In this approach, SDN initiates aggregation appropriately between LTE and an optimal WLAN Access Point (AP) which avoids frequent reconnections and deprived services. As multiple parameters are required for selection of an optimal WLAN AP, so we use Genetic Algorithm (GA) that considers each parameter as fitness value for the selection of optimal WLAN AP. This maximizes the throughput of UE and reduces the traffic pressure over licensed spectrum. Further, a mathematical model is formulated that uses Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) to find the maximum attainable throughput of a UE. Using NS-3, we compared our approach with offloading scenarios and LWA. The simulation results clearly depict that LWA-SA outperforms existing schemes and achieves higher throughput.",

A BSN typically consists of tens (dozens) of biosensor nodes distributed on/in the human body, and these autonomous nodes can form a wireless network to measure physiological signals and execute intelligent treatment automatically. BSNs have wide application prospects in intelligent healthcare. Because physiological signals measured and processed by BSNs involve patient privacy, security mechanisms must be developed to secure BSNs, and therefore the adoption of available key negotiation protocols is fundamental. Due to stringently limited operation resources, BSNs require these protocols to be highly energy efficient. Recent development has discovered that certain physiological signals can be used for efficiently negotiating common keys among biosensor nodes. These signals and fuzzy technology are used to design lightweight key negotiation protocols, and many solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we explore and classify these solutions, and evaluate their performance by analyzing their merits and drawbacks.

Collaborative privacy-preserving data mining based on secured multiparty computation incur high communication and computational cost. Data anonymization is a promising technique in the field of privacy-preserving data mining used to protect the data against identity disclosure. Information loss and common attacks possible on the anonymized data are serious challenges of anonymization. Recently, data anonymization using data mining techniques has showed significant improvement in data utility. Still the existing techniques lack in effective handling of attacks. Hence in this paper, an anonymization algorithm based on clustering and resilient to similarity attack and probabilistic inference attack is proposed. The anonymized data is distributed on Hadoop Distributed File System. The method achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility. In our work the data utility is measured in terms of accuracy and FMeasure with respect to different classifiers. Experiments show that the accuracy, FMeasure and the execution time of the classification algorithms on the privacy-preserved data sets formed by the proposed clustering algorithms are better than the existing algorithms.",

This technology is already available for consumers in a wide range of innovative products, e.g., flexible displays, radio-frequency identification tags and wearable electronic skins which, for instance, collect and analyze data for medical applications. For these systems, thin-film transistors (TFTs) are the key elements responsible for the driving currents. Solution-based materials such as nanoparticle dispersions avail the fabrication on large-area substrates with high throughput processes. In this study, we discuss the integration of ZnO nanoparticle thin-film transistors and inverter circuits on freestanding polymeric substrates enclosing the main issues concerning the transfer of the integration process from a rigid substrate to a flexible one. The TFTs depict VON between −0.2 and 1V, ION/IOFF>104 and field-effect mobility >0.5cm2V−1s−1. Additionally, in order to enhance the transistors and inverters performance, an adaptation on the device configuration, from an inverted coplanar to an inverted staggered setup, was conducted and analyzed. By employing the inverted staggered setup a considerable increase in the contact quality between the semiconductor and the drain and source electrodes was observed. As the integrated devices depict electrical characteristics which enable the fabrication of electronic circuits for the low-cost sector, inverters were fabricated and characterized, evaluating the circuit’s gain as function of the applied supply voltage and circuit’s geometric ratio.",

This question is important because of the protection given to data in law and ethics. Healthcare data are universally considered sensitive (and confidential), so it might seem that the categorisation of less sensitive data is relatively unimportant for medical data research. This paper will explore the arguments that this is not necessarily the case and the relevance of recognizing this. The categorization of data and information requires re-evaluation in the age of Big Data in order to ensure that the appropriate protections are given to different types of data. The aggregation of large amounts of data requires an assessment of the harms and benefits that pertain to large datasets linked together, rather than simply assessing each datum or dataset in isolation. Big Data produce new data via inferences, and this must be recognized in ethical assessments. We propose a schema for a granular assessment of data categories. The use of schemata such as this will assist decision-making by providing research ethics committees and information governance bodies with guidance about the relative sensitivities of data. This will ensure that appropriate and proportionate safeguards are provided for data research subjects and reduce inconsistency in decision making.",

This study aims to investigate whether PPPs access in a hospital environment violates patient privacy. If so, to what extent can we manage patient privacy while accessing PPPs in this environment? We investigated this question by analyzing questionnaire-based data from two Asian countries: Group A (China) and Group B (Pakistan). For data collection, we targeted those medical entities which were directly dealing with PPPs in their routine tasks. Results suggest that patient type directly influences the collection of PPPs: Group A (one-time = 1.9, follow-up = 1.06) and Group B (one-time = 2.0 and follow-up = 1.9). Both groups agreed that patients have the right to control their own PPPs. In both, doctors are the most trusted entity: for Group A, the Pearson Chi-Square with one degree of freedom is 1.414, p = 0.234, whereas for Group B, the Pearson Chi-Square with three degrees of freedom is 4.511, p = 0.11. Most of the Group A entities (92%) are familiar with unauthorized access of PPPs, while in Group B the level was only 35%. In Group B, only 35% of entities stated the purpose, specification and use limitations of PPPs. Doctors in both groups showed a high utilization of PPPs read authorization rights. This empirical evidence about PPPs usage in both countries will benefit health technology and improve policy on patient privacy.",

The development of the Virtual Patient will change conventional medicine, which has been based upon experience and expectation, into “predictive medicine” that will have the capacity to develop solutions based upon prior understanding of the dynamic mechanisms and the quantitative logic of human physiology. Drug discovery, medical and welfare apparatus, and clinical trials in silico will improve the development of products with higher efficiency, reliability and safety while reducing cost. They will also impact upon knowledge-intensive industries. Such program aims at playing a key role in this new area, by sharing and generating solutions as well as human resources contributing to establishment of “in silico medicine” as a basis of the predictive medicine within an international framework. In the long-term, computational physiological models will be refined, linked and validated until they are capable of providing essential predictions to clinicians when healthcare decisions need to be made. As the amount of data reinforcing the models grows, predictions will become more and more patient-centred, with models migrating from statistical, average models to physiological and mechanistic models informed by the unique characteristics of the patient. Systems Patientomics will propose new ways of combining this rich patient information space in a highly visual, coherent, meaningful way and of generating new clinical information by blending and fusing existing information, ultimately creating a “Patient Avatar” capable of supporting the medical professional by producing new clinical knowledge emerging from the integration of patient- and population-specific information.

Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.",

Sport Internet of Things (IoTs) based on the sensor technique and modern communication technology are becoming more and more important to current sport training and daily activities. Sensor-based sport monitoring approaches lead people to take advantage of the wearable sport devices to monitor their own physiological parameters, in which we will focus on the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse measurement. In order to measure these two parameters, we will adopt near-infrared portable tissue oximeter with detection module using STM32 microprocessor. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is becoming a widely used research instrument to measure tissue oxygen (O2) status non-invasively. Continuous-wave spectrometers are the most commonly used devices, which provide semi-quantitative changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in small blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries and venules). Through the measurement using the near-infrared technology, we could obtain the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse parameters. After obtaining the above two parameters, the portable device will send the data to the remote coaches or doctors via GPRS/WiFi/Zigbee networks. The data of the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse that is detected by the detection module are processed by the expert decision-making system in order to provide the coaches and doctors with the athlete condition. In addition, the data can be sent to the smart phones of the players, coaches or doctors through GPRS/WiFi networks, in which the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse data of the athletes can be displayed according to the requirement of the remote users.

Although cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, cyberwars are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective.",

We present a novel, quasi-solid rechargeable 3D microbattery assembled on a 3D-printed perforated polymer substrate (3DPS) with interconnected channels formed through XYZ planes. Simple and inexpensive electrophoretic-deposition routes are applied for the fabrication of all the thin-film active-material layers of the microbattery. With the advantage of thin films, which conformally follow all the contours of the 3D substrate and are composed of nanosize electrode materials, like modified Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP, Lithium Titanate (LTO), and original polymer-in-ceramic electrolyte, our 3D microbatteries offer high reversible specific capacity and high pulse-power capability.",

Most commercially available systems assume that a single device monitors a plethora of user information. In reality, BSN technology is transitioning to multi-device synchronous measurement environments; fusion of the data from multiple, potentially heterogeneous, sensor sources is therefore becoming a fundamental yet non-trivial task that directly impacts application performance. Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision). The survey also covers data fusion in the domains of emotion recognition and general-health and introduce relevant directions and challenges of future research on multi-sensor fusion in the BSN domain.",

abstract = "There has been a shift in research towards the convergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms motivated by the need for IoT applications to leverage the unique characteristics of the cloud. IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes “things” to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated against four established service composition algorithms in multiple cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, and COM2), with the results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.",

Such protocols were designed for scenarios where only a few tags (typically just two) are involved, so issues such as preventing an object from abandoning the proof right after being interrogated simply do not make sense. The idea, however, is very interesting for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications where a potentially large population of objects must be grouped together. In this paper we address this issue by presenting the notion of Probabilistic Yoking Proofs (PYP) and introducing three main criteria to assess their performance: cost, security, and fairness. Our proposal combines the message structure found in classical grouping proof constructions with an iterative Poisson sampling process where the probability of each object being sampled varies over time. We introduce a number of mechanisms to apply fluctuations to each object’s sampling probability and present different sampling strategies. Our experimental results confirm that most strategies achieve good security and fairness levels while keeping the overall protocol cost down.",

This study presents an overview of the literature on residential DR systems, load-scheduling techniques, and the latest ICT that supports residential DR applications. Furthermore, challenges are highlighted and analyzed, which are likely to become relevant research topics with regard to the residential DR of smart grid. The literature review shows that most DR schemes suffer from an externality problem that involves the effect of high-level customer consumption on the price rates of other customers, especially during peak period.

The results showed that IoT logistics is the most promising IoT application, due to its strong market potential. IoT healthcare is perceived to have strength in wide consumer market demand, but reliability issues and regulation issues were posed.

Yet there are many technical and commercial challenges which question the future of peer-assisted solutions in industrial settings. This includes among others unreliability of peer-to-peer networks, the lack of incentives for peers’ participation, and copyright issues. In this paper, we carefully review and systematize this ongoing debate around the future of peer-assisted networks and propose a novel taxonomy to characterize the research and industrial efforts in the area. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the last decade in the peer-assisted content delivery research and devise a novel taxonomy to characterize the identified challenges and the respective proposed solutions in the literature. Our survey includes a thorough review of the three very large scale feasibility studies conducted for BBC iPlayer, MSN Video and Conviva, five large commercial peer-assisted CDNs - Kankan, LiveSky, Akamai NetSession, Spotify, Tudou - and a vast scope of technical papers. We focus both on technical challenges in deploying peer-assisted solutions and also on non-technical challenges caused due to heterogeneity in user access patterns and distribution of resources among users as well as commercial feasibility related challenges attributed to the necessity of accounting for the interests and incentives of Internet Service Providers, End-Users and Content Providers. The results of our study suggest that many of technical challenges for implementing peer-assisted content delivery networks on an industrial scale have been already addressed in the literature, whereas a problem of finding economically viable solutions to incentivize participation in peer-assisted schemes remains an open issue to a large extent. Furthermore, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable expansion of conventional CDNs to a broader network of connected devices through machine to machine communication.",

M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications represent one of the main pillars of the new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), and is making possible new opportunities for the eHealth business. Nevertheless, the large number of M2M protocols currently available hinders the election of a suitable solution that satisfies the requirements that can demand eHealth applications.
Objectives
In the first place, to develop a tool that provides a benchmarking analysis in order to objectively select among the most relevant M2M protocols for eHealth solutions. In the second place, to validate the tool with a particular use case: the respiratory rehabilitation.
Methods
A software tool, called Distributed Computing Framework (DFC), has been designed and developed to execute the benchmarking tests and facilitate the deployment in environments with a large number of machines, with independence of the protocol and performance metrics selected.
Results
DDS, MQTT, CoAP, JMS, AMQP and XMPP protocols were evaluated considering different specific performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, bandwidth consumption, latency and jitter. The results obtained allowed to validate a case of use: respiratory rehabilitation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in two scenarios with different types of requirement: Home-Based and Ambulatory.
Conclusions
The results of the benchmark comparison can guide eHealth developers in the choice of M2M technologies. In this regard, the framework presented is a simple and powerful tool for the deployment of benchmark tests under specific environments and conditions.",

Based on a new hybrid distance, novel Gaussian kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets (FRS) for HIS were constructed in our previous study. In real-world applications, with the deepening of cognition and improvements in technology, attribute values in an information system often evolve over time; in particular, there are three cases: when missing values are imputed, error values are corrected, and the values are coarsened or refined. This has posed challenges to developing efficient data analysis algorithms. In this paper, the changing mechanisms of the attribute values and fuzzy equivalence relations in FRS are analyzed. FRS approaches for incrementally updating approximations in HIS are presented. Moreover, two corresponding incremental algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experiments on eight data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an artificial data set show that incremental approaches can effectively improve the performance of updating approximations and not only significantly shorten the computational time, but also increase approximation classification accuracies.",

The nodes of most complex WSN applications sport desktop-level operating systems and this reliance on software make them ideal prey for traditional threats, like viruses and general malware. To address these problems, in this paper we devise a system for a dedicated mobile node to locate, track, access and cure the infected elements of a WSN, threatened by a proximity malware infection. In parallel, we provide a mathematical formulation for the aforementioned operations. We perform extended simulations, comparing our proposal against classic solutions in different network scenarios and we use the results of the mathematical formulation as a benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce a variation of our proposal, capable to support the concurrent operation of multiple mobile nodes and implement cooperation.",

abstract = "The current main trends in the embedded systems area, the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), are leveraging the development of complex, distributed, low-power, and high-performance embedded systems. An important feature needed in this new Era is the embedded intelligence enabling to locally process data and actuate over the environment, without the need of a remote central processing server. In this context, emerged the Smart Cameras: devices able to acquire images and apply sophisticated algorithms for different Image Processing and Computer Vision (IP/CV) applications. Both the technology convergence and the evolution of embedded systems to multi/many-core architectures allow envisioning future cameras as many-core systems able to efficiently explore the natural IP/CV parallelism to meet embedded application’s constraints, e.g. real-time, power consumption, silicon area, temperature management, fault tolerance, among others. In this work, we show the development of a Many-Core Vision Processor architecture, suitable for future Smart Cameras. In our design methodology, we analyze several aspects involved, from high-level application analysis down to fine-grained operations and physical aspects (e.g. geometry and spatial distribution). The main analysis is performed using a SystemC/TLM2.0 simulator specially developed for this project. Silicon Area, Power Consumption and Timing estimations are also provided as results of an early Design-Space Exploration (DSE). Using these results we propose a first complete architecture, which is implemented in an FPGA. Details about the hardware implementation are provided, as well as synthesis results. In comparison to other works, from the literature, the implemented architecture shows the potential of the project developed in this work.",

In the specialized standards body with a central position in the standardization of core mobile technologies, namely 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), the terminology of ‘releases’ is used.

In this paper, Knowle—an online news management system upon semantic link network model is introduced. Knowle is a news event centrality data management system. The core elements of Knowle are news events on the Web, which are linked by their semantic relations. Knowle is a hierarchical data system, which has three different layers including the bottom layer (concepts), the middle layer (resources), and the top layer (events). The basic blocks of the Knowle system—news collection, resources representation, semantic relations mining, semantic linking news events are given. Knowle does not require data providers to follow semantic standards such as RDF or OWL, which is a semantics-rich self-organized network. It reflects various semantic relations of concepts, news, and events. Moreover, in the case study, Knowle is used for organizing and mining health news, which shows the potential on forming the basis of designing and developing big data analytics based innovation framework in the health domain.",

abstract = "The Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) is a wireless network that is designed to allow communication among sensor nodes that are attached to a human body to monitor the body’s vital parameters and environment. The design and development of such WBSN systems for health monitoring have received a large amount of attention recently, in research studies and in industry. This attention is mainly motivated by costly health care and by recent advances in the development of miniature health monitoring devices as well as emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which contribute to the main challenges of 5G. The existence of an explicit approach to address the required software design and verification should be very beneficial for the construction and maintenance of such systems. This paper presents a preventive health care system that has a flexible design. The proposed system is based on an architecture that has heterogeneous nodes and provides both daily continuous monitoring as well as specific controls. We defined a model to describe the WBSN’s global behavior. An important aspect of this work is that we propose a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to address the derivation of each node’s behavior in the WBSN from the WBSN global behavior. This approach allows developers to obtain a system design from the global specification of its requirement. To ensure the conformance of this design to its specification, the derived behaviors should be validated and verified before their deployment. In fact, formal methods are powerful tools for software engineers to verify the logical correctness of concurrent software at different levels of its life cycle. Model checking is one of the most powerful formal methods for verifying the logical correctness of such concurrent systems. In this work, we make use of a model checking approach that is based on a model transformation to validate the automatically derived behavior of a WBSN for health monitoring. This model-driven approach will check whether the derived system behaves correctly according to its global specification, while the objective is to increase the system’s performance and QoS. This approach allows the developer to reason about a model of the global system rather than about the system itself.",

However, due to the temporal and spatial transience of spectrum utilization by licensed incumbents, optimal spectrum resource management becomes critical for: (a) effective D2D communication without disrupting the licensed incumbents, and (b) sustained operation in a multi-hop mesh environment due to the inherent energy constraint of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose SpEED-IoT: Spectrum aware Energy- Efficient multi-hop multi-channel routing scheme for D2D communication in IoT mesh network. We assume the knowledge of a radio environment map (REM) obtained through dedicated spectrum sensors that capture the spatio-temporal spectrum usage. We exploit such REMs to propose a multi-hop routing scheme that finds the: (a) best route, (b) best available channels at each hop along the route, and (c) optimal transmission power for each hop. SpEED-IoT also employs an evolutionary game theoretic route allocation model to sustain parallel D2D communication. SpEED-IoT ensures: (i) licensed incumbent protection, (ii) IoT device energy preservation, (iii) effective end-to-end data rate optimization, and (iv) fast convergence and fair route assignment among interfering D2D communications. Through simulation-driven GENI-based IoT testbed, we evaluate SpEED-IoT’s performance in terms of: (a) ensuring connectivity and reachability among the IoT devices under varying spectrum usage conditions, (b) data rate optimization of the assigned routes and the overall IoT network, (c) effectiveness in licensed incumbent protection, and (d) degree of fairness while assigning routes to multiple interfering devices.",

With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, flexible sensors are regarded as one of the most important technologies for the development of human-friendly wearable devices. Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on conjugated polymers or small molecules are promising sensor platforms because they have various advantages, including high sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and low-cost fabrication processes. OFET-based sensors enable continuous monitoring of external stimuli or target analytes with superior detection capabilities. This review describes the working principles and sensing mechanisms of various OFET-based sensors, including chemical, biological, photo, pressure, and temperature sensors, and introduces the recent progress in this field. In addition, the technical challenges and future outlook of OFET-based sensors for next-generation flexible electronics are briefly discussed.",

Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay.",

In this context, the connected object presented in this article aims at implementation a longitudinal follow-up of the walk by a health professional. Continuous remote data analysis applies behavior learning methods by modeling walking habits and allows the detection of deviations by application of thresholds defined by the expert. We propose an instrumented shoe insole to provide such monitoring (number of steps, distance covered and gait speed). In this perspective, we designed a low power microelectronic device integrated into the thickness of an insole in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of such a device in laboratory and in living conditions. The project called “FOOT-TEST” is funded by the DIRECCTE of the Midi-Pyrenees Region in France. This project brought together a manufacturer who specializes in the design of foot-care systems, geriatricians and our laboratory specialized in electronics to propose a technical solution adapted to frail individuals. Two smart insole prototypes have been produced and a first evaluation of the smart insole in real use conditions has been performed. According to user feedback, the smart insole seems to be much easier to use than commercial connected pedometers. Moreover, in terms of performance, the smart insole provides better results. In this paper, we present specifications of the device, technological choices and the design of two versions of the smart insole, methods used to measure desired settings, a first evaluation of the system and, finally, preliminary conclusions and work in progress.",

Extensive deployment and sustainability of integrated care services (ICS) constitute an unmet need to reduce the burden of chronic conditions. The European Union project NEXES (2008–2013) assessed the deployment of four ICS encompassing the spectrum of severity of chronic patients.
Objective
The current study aims to (i) describe the open source Adaptive Case Management (ACM) system (Linkcare®) developed to support the deployment of ICS at the level of healthcare district; (ii) to evaluate its performance; and, (iii) to identify key challenges for regional deployment of ICS.
Methods
We first defined a conceptual model for ICS management and execution composed of five main stages. We then specified an associated logical model considering the dynamic runtime of ACM. Finally, we implemented the four ICS as a physical model with an ICS editor to allow professionals (case managers) to play active roles in adapting the system to their needs. Instances of ICS were then run in Linkcare®. Four ICS provided a framework for evaluating the system: Wellness and Rehabilitation (W&R) (number of patients enrolled in the study (n)=173); Enhanced Care (EC) in frail chronic patients to prevent hospital admissions, (n=848); Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (HH/ED) (n=2314); and, Support to remote diagnosis (Support) (n=7793).

The software system adopts TinyOS which is composed of system kernel, device drivers and applications. Energy-saving algorithm is implemented in the software system. The monitoring network adopts two networking protocols. The Collection Tree Protocol is a tree-based collection protocol which consists in collecting the data generated in the network into a base station. The dissemination is the complementary operation to collection. The goal of a dissemination protocol is to reliably deliver a piece of control and synchronization instructions to every node in the network.

One of the novel aspects of the developed system is the testability of all the important modules of the ASIC (both analog and digital) using auxiliary circuits implemented in the ASIC. Another novel aspect is a new embedded and efficient signal processing algorithm which is robust to small motion artifacts. This new algorithm has been implemented on a low-power micro-controller (embedded processing mode) as well as on PC using Python (remote processing mode). The PO ASIC is fabricated in 180 nm mixed-mode CMOS technology and it works at 1.8 V supply voltage. The average power consumption of the analog front-end is 176 µW and that of the digital module controlling the analog front-end is 23 µW. The prototype PO system made using the custom ASIC operates from a 3.7 V lithium ion battery and consumes about 8 mW power. The prototype is housed in a 3D printed casing and it connects with a display device via USB or wirelessly to laptop/smartphone/tablet. Readings on 20 subjects, both in the lab and in hospital, show less than 2% deviation in the measured SpO2 level and worst case deviation of 2.7 beats per minute for the measured heart rate, when compared with the commercial POs.",

In this study, we used a flexible electrode material comprised of organic conductor-elastomer-metal nanoparticles, as the core material and the inkjet printing method as the core process. These were used to form a flexible sensor for electronic skin applications, which involved vertically laminated sensors that utilize different sensing principles, thus enabling the realization of a flexible bimodal sensor with negligible interference. The pressure sensor with low resistivity and a flexible electrode, which was implemented using the sophisticated synthesis method, performed well under low-voltage (0.5mV) operation conditions, exhibited pressure sensitivity over a wide range (3Pa to 5kPa), and showed excellent reliability characteristics (100,000 cycles) that can withstand severe mechanical stress. The temperature sensor, which was formed by a long bent organic conductor-metal line, changes its resistance with temperature, has a resistance change sensitivity of 0.32% per degree of temperature change, and exhibits a hysteresis-free temperature sensing capability. In particular, this device has maintained its robustness even over 5000 bending cycles. The 25 pixels temperature-pressure bimodal sensor array demonstrates very fast response rates, high sensitivity, and negligible interference performance. The low-resistivity/high-flexibility conducting electrode, inkjet printing process, device architecture, and integration scheme proposed in this study are expected to be widely used for electronic skin, multi-mode sensors, and flexible devices.",

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.",

In addition, Big Data analytics requires new and sophisticated algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques to process data in real-time with high accuracy and efficiency. However, recently, research incorporated various deep learning techniques with hybrid learning and training mechanisms of processing data with high speed. Most of these techniques are specific to scenarios and based on vector space thus, shows poor performance in generic scenarios and learning features in big data. In addition, one of the reason of such failure is high involvement of humans to design sophisticated and optimized algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques. In this article, we bring forward an approach of comparing various deep learning techniques for processing huge amount of data with different number of neurons and hidden layers. The comparative study shows that deep learning techniques can be built by introducing a number of methods in combination with supervised and unsupervised training techniques.",

We present a new algorithm, Potential Field Segmentation (PFS), and propose the use of ensemble approaches that combine the results generated by PFS and other methods to achieve a fused segmentation. For the PFS method, we build on our recently proposed clustering algorithm, Potential Field Clustering, which is based on an analogy with the concept of potential field in Physics. We view the intensity of a pixel in an MRI as a “mass” that creates a potential field. Specifically, for each pixel in the MRI, the potential field is computed and, if smaller than an adaptive potential threshold, the pixel is associated with the tumor region. This “small potential” segmentation criterion is intuitively valid because tumor pixels have larger “mass” and thus the potential of surrounding regions is also much larger than in other regions of smaller or no “mass”. We evaluate the performance of the different methods, including the ensemble approaches, on the publicly available Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS) MRI benchmark database.",

Since sensing results of Body Area Networks (BAN) can directly impact the control of medical equipment, the authenticity and integrity of sensing data is essential for safety of patients. Restricted by the limited resources available to BAN sensors, researchers have referred to Physical Unclonable Function of the nodes to achieve authentication. Existing approaches focus on the authentication between control unit and sensors. Mutual authentication between sensor pairs or among sensor groups has not been carefully studied. In this paper, we propose to design several mutual authentication mechanisms for BAN sensor pairs and sensor groups with physical unclonable functions (PUF). Using control unit as a middle point, the body sensors can establish shared secrets so that authenticity of exchanged data can be protected. In sensor groups of BAN, we design both control unit based and sensor based sender authentication mechanisms. To reduce hardware demand and overhead, the proposed approaches do not require sensors to conduct any encryption operations, which suits the restricted resources available to BAN nodes. We design probability based schemes to defend against collusive sender impersonation attacks. We formally prove the safety of the protocols. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed approaches have low overhead and are robust against multiple types of attacks.",

Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning. In particular, we propose a stateless greedy forwarding that uses such an environment learning to proactively avoid the local minimum problem by diverting traffic with an algorithm that emulates electrostatic repulsive forces. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our Greedy Forwarding achieves in the worst case a 3.291 path stretch approximation bound with respect to the shortest path, without assuming presence of symmetrical links or unit disk graphs. We evaluate our approach with both numerical and event-driven simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate improvement of application level throughput due to a reduced path stretch under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios.",

A gateway is often employed as infrastructure in this scenario, acting as the data collector, the relay and the agency of the initial multisensor fusion, and thus must be able to handle as many concurrent requests as possible from diverse sensors of different vendors. This study proposes a high-performance scheduling model with a cloud-supported caching mechanism for the gateway of the cloud sensor system-based smart-living. Scheduling and caching optimization are performed by 0–1 programming combined with the periodic task models. Correlation analyses of the simulated results determine the most effective factors to the performance, and the performance tests with the selected factors show that a gateway with 2.4G-uniCPU/4G-memory/300G-harddisk can support the system with one million sensors registered in the cloud and 5000 concurrent live sensors through it, with a 25× gain throughput improvement compared to the traditional application-type scheduling.",

This vision faces many challenges in terms of integrating technologies, especially RFID-sensor networks (RSNs). In this paper, we introduce a framework for node deployment and delay-tolerance in RSNs under the IoT paradigm. Our framework is comprised of two components. The first is SIWR, a novel Smart Integrated WSNs and RFIDs architecture that classifies nodes into light nodes and super integrated nodes. SIWR employs an optimal linear programming formulation to cost-efficiently place integrated RFID readers. However, integrated IoT architectures face significant connectivity challenges. IoT settings assume no guaranteed contemporaneous end-to-end path between node pairs. To this end, in the second part of our framework, we introduce DIRSN, an optimized delay-tolerant approach for integrated RFID-sensor networks. This is a novel scheme for data routing and courier nodes’ selection in RSNs. DIRSN’s formulation minimizes delay across the network without violating the main dense-deployment and load-balancing requirements. In addition, DIRSN builds on SIWR’s novel architecture to locate the best set of couriers that promise to provide connectivity. Our combined approach is compared to three types of RSN integration architectures and the results show that our architecture and courier selection approaches perform substantially better than other architectures in terms of minimizing delay, cost, packet loss, and in handling extensive traffic demands.",

Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

Their possible adoption as indicative air quality measurements devices poses new challenges due to the need to operate in continuous monitoring modes in uncontrolled environments. Several issues, including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, especially for wearables and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches. We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming linear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm, on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only rely on instantaneous sensor array response. The latter have been shown to be best choice whenever prompt and precise response is needed.",

One of the most exciting applications of WSNs in smart cities is detection, monitoring, and tracking which is referred to as object tracking sensor networks (OTSN). The adaptation of OTSN into urban cities brought new exciting challenges for reaching the goal of future smart cities. Such challenges focus primarily on problems related to active monitoring and tracking in smart cities. In this paper, we present the essential characteristics of OTSN, monitoring and tracking application used with the content of smart city. Moreover, we discussed the taxonomy of OTSN along with analysis and comparison. Furthermore, research challenges are investigated concerning energy reservation, object detection, object speed, accuracy in tracking, sensor node collaboration, data aggregation and object recovery position estimation.

abstract = "With the rapid development of Cloud Computing, Big Data, Social Networks, and the Internet of Things, typical service optimization problems (SOPs) such as service selection, service composition and service resource scheduling in the service computing field have become more and more complicated due to the constant enrichment and dynamic aggregation of large number of services, as well as the unceasing variation of user requirements. Meanwhile, with the long-term development and evolution of business in many application domains, some service domain features (such as priori, correlation and similarity) are usually formed, which have strong influences on solving SOPs. Unfortunately, the existing research efforts on SOPs primarily concentrate on designing general algorithms for specific problems without considering the service domain features. This often leads to undesirable results of SOPs. Therefore, how to design a paradigm of service domain-oriented optimization algorithms with service domain features becomes a challenge for providing optimization strategies and algorithms to solve SOPs effectively. By considering the influences of service domain features on solving SOPs, this paper proposes a set of service domain-oriented artificial bee colony algorithms (S-ABC) based on the optimization mechanism of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method. Furthermore, by configuring the items and parameters of the S-ABC paradigm in detail, optimization algorithms for particular SOPs (e.g., service selection and composition) could be derived. In this paper, the superiority of our proposed S-ABC is verified through solving concurrent service selection and service composition problem. By exploiting the artificial bee colony algorithms for the optimization problems in service domains, this work makes novel contributions for solving SOPs, as well as extends the theory of the swarm intelligence optimization.",

In IWSN, unlike other sensor networks, late arrival of packets or delay or disruption to an on-going communication are considered as critical failure. Also, because IWSN is deployed in the overcrowded industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band it is difficult to meet this unique QoS requirements due to stiff competition for bandwidth from other technologies operating in ISM band resulting in scarcity of spectrum for reliable communication and/or disruption of ongoing communication. However, cognitive radio (CR) provides more spectral opportunities through opportunistic-use of unused licensed spectrum while ensuring minimal interference to licensed users. Similarly, spectrum handoff, which is a new type of handoff in cognitive radio, has the potential to offer increase bandwidth, reliable, smooth and interference-free communication for IWSNs through opportunistic-use of spectrum, minimal switching-delays, and efficient target channel selection strategies as well as effective link recovery maintenance. As a result, a new paradigm known as cognitive radio industrial wireless sensor network (CR-IWSN) has become the interest of recent research efforts. In this paper, we highlight and discuss important QoS requirements of IWSN as well as efforts of existing IWSN standards to address the challenges. We discuss the potential and how cognitive radio and spectrum handoff can be useful in the attempt to provide real-time reliable and smooth communication for IWSNs.",

However, these approaches do not consider time-invariant keys. This feature enables using these so-created keys for symmetrically encrypting data (e.g. smartphone pictures), enabling their decryption using the key derived from the current ECG readings. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing EbH, a mechanism for persistent key generation based on ECG. EbH produces seeds from which encryption keys are generated. Experimental results over 24 h for 199 users show that EbH, under certain settings, can produce permanent seeds (thus time-invariant keys) computed on-the-fly and different for each user—up to 95.97% of users produce unique keys. In addition, EbH can be tuned to produce seeds of different length (up to 300 bits) and with variable min-entropy (up to 93.51). All this supports the workability of EbH in a real setting.",

This study provides a definition for urban big data while exploring its features and applications of China's city intelligence. The differences between city intelligence in China and the “smart city” concept in other countries are compared to highlight and contrast the unique definition and model for China's city intelligence in this paper. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of urban big data in city intelligence by showing that it not only serves as the cornerstone of this trend as it also plays a core role in the diffusion of city intelligence technology and serves as an inexhaustible resource for the sustained development of city intelligence. This study also points out the challenges of shaping and developing of China's urban big data. Considering the supporting and core role that urban big data plays in city intelligence, the study then expounds on the key points of urban big data, including infrastructure support, urban governance, public services, and economic and industrial development. Finally, this study points out that the utility of city intelligence as an ideal policy tool for advancing the goals of China's urban development. In conclusion, it is imperative that China make full use of its unique advantages—including using the nation's current state of development and resources, geographical advantages, and good human relations—in subjective and objective conditions to promote the development of city intelligence through the proper application of urban big data.",

abstract = "Defects and errors in new or recently completed construction work continually pervade the industry. Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.",

Plants not only constitute green space useful to contrast urban pollution effects or provide ecosystemic benefits to residents but they can also be used as bioindicators and their involvement in communication networks can represent a significant contribution to build a smart, green city. The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) envisages that objects that surround us will be connected and there are no reasons to exclude urban trees from among the “wired object”. Radio frequency identification devices (RFID) may represent a prerequisite of IoT application and they can be used for tree protection and management, thanks to tagging experience carried out on various plant species. RFID tags can be easily associated with plants, externally or internally. This latter approach is particularly indicated if the identification of trees needs to be secured since its production, eliminating the risk of tag losses or removal. Interesting applications may be derived by implementing RFID tags in biomonitoring systems in order to guarantee a real-time data communication in which tags may act as antennas for multifunctional green spaces. Moreover, the virtualization of green areas using sensors and mobile devices can lead to the desktop management of the urban green with the possibility of implementing a real-time navigation throughout the areas. A complex relational network in which data can be collected thanks to geospatial methods can be integrated by an IoT approach in which RFID-plants can play a significant role.",

In this study we develop and evaluate an e-health consultancy system utilizing cloud computing (we so called “On-Cloud Healthcare Clinic”) that enables doctors and healthcare workers to identify and treat non-communicable diseases in rural and remote communities in Bangladesh, a developing nation. Adopting a design science research approach we developed the solution based around stakeholders’ collaborative participation in prototyping and then evaluated the design using focus groups. The cloud-based solution supports doctors in evaluating and diagnosing patients’ data and medical history through intermediary health care workers or community clinics. The design also knowledgeably allows informed decisions on a course of treatment with follow up for remote or underserved communities. Previously unavailable clinical work is thus practically achieved through utilization of the cloud based e-health system, and generalisation of this approach in healthcare management is discussed.",

To support this work, we introduce two classes of metrics: a set of three tracking performance metrics, and a set of three network efficiency metrics.

However, there are some aspects needed to be improved. So, the low-frequency modulation is used to reliably acquire the respiration information. The measurement method is improved based on the Lambert–Beer Law. Also, we compensate the initial absorbance because of the light absorbance of the sensor at different wavelengths. The influence of the temperature change is analyzed on the measurement. All of these methods make the end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure accurate and convenient.",

Performance, however, may also be assessed in terms of the fraction of events which may successfully/unsuccessfully be detected and reported within a time interval of interest, i.e., mission time. Such a performance metric, here termed event goodput, is key for all random event-driven networks, ranging from surveillance and intrusion detection applications operating in time critical scenarios, to mobile and wearable crowd-sensed ecosystems, where mobile sensors are utilized by a number of different applications. When reporting the appearance of a series of possible, but unknown, phenomena, predicting which event goodput may be obtained during the planned mission time is challenging. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the network-wide problem to the analysis of the performance of individual nodes, in terms of their capability of handling given fractions of event arrivals under fixed probabilistic guarantees. This is obtained as a function of mission time, event arrival and energy consumption models of different, detection and communication schemes, all realistic.",

With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system.

In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices. ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.",

Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.",

abstract = "In the era of “big data”, recent developments in the area of information and communication technologies (ICT) are facilitating organizations to innovate and grow. These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.",

abstract = "Nowadays, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is emerging very fast and so many new methods and algorithms are coming up for finding the optimal path for disseminating emergency messages. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one of the cultural algorithms for solving many hard problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). ACO is a natural behaviour of ants, which work stochastically with the help of pheromone trails deposited in the shortest route to find their food. This optimization procedure involves adapting, positive feedback and inherent parallelism. Each ant will deposit certain amount of pheromone in the tour construction it makes searching for food. This type of communication is known as stigmetric communication. In addition, if a dense WBAN environment prevails, such as hospital, i.e. in the environment of overlapping WBAN, game formulation was introduced for analyzing the mixed strategy behaviour of WBAN. In this paper, the ant colony optimization approach to the travelling salesman problem was applied to the WBAN to determine the shortest route for sending emergency message to the doctor via sensor nodes; and also a static Bayesian game formulation with mixed strategy was analysed to enhance the network lifetime. Whenever the patient needs any critical care or any other medical issue arises, emergency messages will be created by the WBAN and sent to the doctor's destination. All the modes of communication were realized in a simulation environment using OMNet++. The authors investigated a balanced model of emergency message dissemination and network lifetime in WBAN using ACO and Bayesian game formulation.",

These trends have resulted in the need for a variety of new computing architectures that will be offered by future cloud infrastructure. These architectures are anticipated to impact areas, such as connecting people and devices, data-intensive computing, the service space and self-learning systems.

We carry out a deductive and interpretivist method interviewing 19 senior experts whole profiles represent the different forces of the Triple Helix model. Our results show the Barcelona city hall has the objective to implement five main innovative services which are fuelled by six main emerging technologies. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the universities curriculum is not aligned with the city hall's objectives and a gap exists to prepare the undergraduates to the professions required for the Smart City. We recommend six propositions to reshape the University program curricula and leverage the application of Complexity theory to network. The originality of this study is to propose a 3-phases method along with a framework with pre-filled templates and protocols of interviews to analyze universities that pursue the objective to support Smart Cities implementation in a new context of science of cities.",

The main consideration the Court dealt with was what it means for information to be “about” an individual. In this paper I address two questions: a) how is information determined to be “about” an individual under the Act; and b) how should this determination be made in the future? I conclude that currently available guidance from the courts, the Australian Information Commissioner and scholarly commentary are inadequate to enable individuals, organisations and agencies to consistently make such determinations. Accordingly I draw on approaches to this question taken in Canada, New Zealand, the European Union and the United Kingdom to argue that the definition should be broadly interpreted in a technologically-aware manner. This will help to ensure that personal information is more comprehensively protected under the Privacy Act.",

A caregiver must assess the well being of residents and report to the medical staff if there is something unusual with a resident. Deviations from the routine will trigger an alarm, and automatic tools can help in making timely decisions. In this paper, we explore three visualization metaphors aiming at providing caregivers with an individualized overview of the activities carried out by residents in a given time frame. We postulate that this overview is sufficient to distinguish between normal and abnormal periods of time when visually compared in groups. We also present two automated approaches, data driven and knowledge driven respectively, to detect abnormalities. The visualization and the automated approaches are tested on a naturalistic dataset obtained from a long-term personalized sensing and annotation campaign in a residence for geriatric patients. Data is of two types, obtained from IoT infrastructure and wearables and from manual annotations made by the staff. Both approaches were empirically evaluated and validated in the paper. A side product of this research is a large repository of cleansed data from the sensing and annotation campaign for 45 older adults over a period of 39 months.",

abstract = "Healthcare industry is one of the areas where wireless sensor network provides a lot of opportunities. Online data sharing in healthcare industry not only increases the efficiency but also reduces the time constraints. In the healthcare wireless sensor network, patient’s report is available online for health professionals without any delay after patient’s checkup. Data privacy becomes an important issue in healthcare industry due to direct involvement of personal health related data of patients. Modified data may become a serious cause of casualty for patient. Digital signature scheme is a technique of public key cryptography that is widely accepted in digital world to retain privacy and integrity. Certificateless public key cryptography was proposed to remove the complication of certificate management in public key cryptography as well as the key escrow problem inherited in identity based cryptography. An aggregate signature scheme is a many to one map which maps different signatures on different messages to a single signature. This feature is very beneficial in an environment which is constrained by limited bandwidth and low computational time/effort, such as wireless sensor network, vehicular ad-hoc network and Internet of things. Our proposed certificateless aggregate signature enjoys the goodness of both the concepts, certificateless and aggregate. We construct a certificateless aggregate signature scheme and prove the security of constructed scheme by using widely-accepted Random Oracle Model under the computationally hard Diffie-Hellman assumption. Random Oracle Model based security analysis proves that our proposed scheme is provably secure against existential forgery on adaptive chosen message and identity attacks under the hardness of computational Diffie-Hellman problem and achieves the required goals such as confidentiality, non-repudiation and integrity. We use batch verification technique for speedy verification of signatures. Since energy consumption for aggregate signature verification in our scheme is lesser than that in many of the related schemes, the proposed CL-AS scheme is compatible with the resource scanty nature of wireless sensor networks. Thus the proposed CL-AS scheme is efficient and suitable for green healthcare wireless sensor networks (HWSNs).",

abstract = "Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) are deadly infectious diseases those transmit quickly through infected mosquitoes to human or from one infected person to another, resulting in substantial increase in worldwide morbidity and mortality rate. The symptoms of MBDs are almost similar to each other which makes it quite difficult to diagnose the specific disease. However, it is required to diagnose the patient for proper treatment and continuous monitoring of infected patients to control the infection of MBDs. Healthcare services based on fog-cloud assisted cyber-physical system are emerging as a proactive and efficacious solution to provide remote monitoring and early detection of infected users suffering from MBDs. Fog-cloud based cyber-physical system facilitates the alliance of devices in the physical space i.e. smart wearables, IoT sensors and smart cameras with cyber space to generate the required information. Afterwards, it uses cyber space to assimilate, analyze and share medical information amongst users and healthcare service providers. A novel system based on IoT sensors, cloud computing and fog computing is proposed to distinguish, classify and monitor the users infected with MBDs. The objective of this system is to control the outbreak of MBDs at an early stage. In the proposed system, similarity factor is calculated to differentiate among MBDs and then J48 decision tree classifier is used to classify the category of infection for each user. The alerts are instantly generated and sent on user’s mobile from fog layer in case of any abnormality. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used to sense the close proximity between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to monitor and represent the current state of the MBDs outbreak using close proximity data. The experimental evaluations of the proposed system resulted in high accuracy and low error rate to distinguish the MBDs and also provided 94% classification accuracy. The results also reveal that the TNA is an efficient tool to evaluate the state of MBDs outbreak using various statistical parameters.",

Devices connected to the internet (internet of things), social interaction, mobile computing, and cloud computing provide new sources of event data and this trend will continue. The omnipresence of large amounts of event data is an important enabler for process mining. Process mining techniques can be used to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from observed behavior. However, unprecedented volumes of event data also provide new challenges and often state-of-the-art process mining techniques cannot cope. This paper focuses on “conformance checking in the large” and presents a novel decomposition technique that partitions larger process models and event logs into smaller parts that can be analyzed independently. The so-called Single-Entry Single-Exit (SESE) decomposition not only helps to speed up conformance checking, but also provides improved diagnostics. The analyst can zoom in on the problematic parts of the process. Importantly, the conditions under which the conformance of the whole can be assessed by verifying the conformance of the SESE parts are described, which enables the decomposition and distribution of large conformance checking problems. All the techniques have been implemented in ProM, and experimental results are provided.",

In this paper, we proposes an automatic diabetic retinopathy diagnostic system to help patients know about their retinal conditions. We design a portable ophthalmoscope, which is composed of a retinal lens, a smartphone and a frame between them to help patients take fundus images anywhere and anytime. Then the images are transmitted to be analyzed, including localization of optic disk and macular, vessel segmentation, detection of lesions, and grading of DR. We use a multi-scale line operator to improve accuracy in segmenting small-scale vessels, a binary mask and image restoration to reduce the effect of the existence of the vessels on optic disk localization. After the analysis, the fundus image are then graded as normal, mild Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), moderate NPDR or severe NPDR. The grading process uses region segmentation to improve the efficiency. The final grading results are tested based on the fundus images provided by the hospitals. We evaluate our system through comparing our grading result with those graded by experts, which comes out with an overall accuracy of up to 85%.",

abstract = "For various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality). To fulfill these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years. While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. The main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration. In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.",

Whereas, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, wireless sensor networks utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely cognitive wireless sensor network (CWSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. A major challenge in CWSN is maximizing its network lifetime by appropriate power control mechanism. To solve the distributed power control issues in CWSN with imperfect information, a game-theoretic power control mechanism based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed according to the difference and independence of channel sensing results among users of cognitive wireless sensor network (UCWSNs). UCWSNs can use HMM to infer whether its competitors take part in the game, which improves the information accuracy of game and leads to an optimal transmission power. Moreover, to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) of UCWSNs for multimedia information, a utility function based on the tradeoff of signal to interference plus noise ratio and power efficiency is defined for the power control game. Simulation results indicate that the game-theoretic power control mechanism based on HMM can not only improve the power efficiency, but also meet the target SINR better compared with other methods.",

Extreme reliance on data demands quality assurance and trust on processes. Data Provenance is information that can be used to reason about the current state of a data object. Provenance can be broadly described as the information that explains where a piece of data object came from, how it was derived or created, who was involved in said creation, manipulations involved, processes applied, etc. It consists of information that had an effect on the data, evolving to its present state. Provenance has been used widely for the authenticity of data and processes. Despite having such a wide range of uses and applications, provenance poses vexing privacy and integrity challenges. Provenance data itself is, therefore, critical and it must be secured. Over the years, a number of secure provenance schemes have been proposed. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of secure provenance schemes and its associated security issues. In this paper, we have discussed why secure provenance is needed, what are its essential characteristics, and what objectives it serves? We describe the lifecycle of secure provenance and highlighted how trust is achieved in different domains by its application. Firstly, a detailed taxonomy of existing secure provenance schemes is presented. Then, a comparative analysis of existing secure provenance schemes, which highlights their strengths and weaknesses is also provided. Furthermore; we highlight future trends, which should be focused upon by the research community.",

With the application of CPS technology in transportation, energy, manufacturing and other fields, the way people interact with engineered systems is significantly changed. Despite of plenty of benefits, CPS also suffers from many problems and the most important one is data security. On the one hand, the location of data is a link between the cyber space and the physical world. In some scenarios, the data is only allowed to be used in the desired areas, and thus the mobility of CPS devices introduces the location-related security requirements in data management. On the other hand, note that the monitors and sensor devices keep collecting and exchanging sensitive data all the time. As a result, it is a major security challenge for CPS to safely distribute massive amounts of data to the clients with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a new location verification protocol called Ears, which prevents both shortening and lengthening distance frauds in CPS environments. Besides, we design a secure location-sensitive data sharing (SLDS) scheme based on Ears, in which data access is controlled by identity as well as location and the shared data is re-encrypted after each retrieval. We can prove that the proposed Ears protocol and SLDS scheme can achieve the designed security properties. Furthermore, the experimental results show that our schemes are more efficient for real-world applications.",

abstract = "With the rapid growth of information and communication technology (ICT) and Internet of things (IoT), the concept of smart-city is recently introduced by the government of many countries to improve the living environment of urban people. In city areas, the numbers of vehicles are increased exponentially day-by-day. Therefore, it is very difficult to control and manage the city traffic caused by tens of thousands vehicles. The Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is used to communicate with the vehicles to give alert for weather conditions, road defects, traffic conditions, etc. and the conditions of the vehicle including location, speed, traffic status, etc. Therefore, the traffic efficiency and safety of the vehicles can be improved with the help of VANET. To serve this purpose, in the literature, many conditional privacy preserving authentication (CPPA) protocols based on CA-PKC (certificate authority-based public key cryptography), and ID-PKC (identity-based public key cryptography) have been put forwarded. In addition, some of these CPPA protocols use elliptic curve or bilinear-pairing for their implementation. The computation cost for bilinear-pairing and elliptic curve is very high compared to the cryptographic general hash function. Therefore, all the earlier protocols suffer from the heavy computational burden and some security weaknesses as well. Therefore, bilinear-pairing-free, robust and efficient CPPA with group-key agreement protocol for VANETs is essential. This paper presents a password-based conditional privacy preserving authentication and group-key generation (PW-CPPA-GKA) protocol for VANETs. Our protocol offers group-key generation, user leaving, user join, and password change facilities. Our protocol is lightweight in terms computation and communication since it can be designed without bilinear-pairing and elliptic curve.",

abstract = "This article discusses the potential to transfer big data algorithms developed for ‘predictive policing’ to the field of corporate sustainability. To do so the paper starts with the thought experiment asking if major corporate scandals with disastrous environmental (BP Oil spill) or social (Rana Plaza building collapse) consequences, or global warming and floods could be prevented if big data driven predictive algorithms were in place. The article reviews first efforts to utilize big data for promoting sustainability and for reducing harm. By analogy the concept of ‘predictive policing’ is identified to be transferred to a concept called “Predictive Sustainability Control”. A systematic literature review on predictive policing is conducted. In a next step all parameters, characteristics, functional areas and processes, as well as legal and ethical issues of predictive policing were clustered and presented. Subsequently the concept is developed out of the clustered themes and criteria (Table 1) and a definition is provided: Predictive Sustainability Control is the use of analytical techniques to identify subjects for mutual deliberation, supervision and intervention with the goal of preventing future harm related to environmental, social and governance issues, solving past scandals, and identifying potential actors/corporations of unsustainable activities and their stakeholders in the near future. Furthermore three functional areas (sustainability management, stakeholder partnership and regulatory integration) are defined and the concept is operationalized in a big data driven environment (Fig. 1). In the operationalization the concept of a digital ‘planetary nervous system’ is proposed and eXtensible Business Reporting Language data repositories used in corporate data management and Corporate Social Responsibility reporting were integrated to arrive at a data set, where predictive analytics could be applied to prevent future harm and reduce current unsustainability. In conclusion the question of governance, data protection and privacy is discussed critically and future research avenues for theory advancement and empirical testing are presented. In closing limitations of legality and functionality are discussed. The overall scientific value can be seen in the potential, which big data and algorithms have also for promoting and enforcing sustainable development based on rigorous data management leading to the predictive identification of likely unsustainable events.",

This process has proved to be ineffective since it is laborious, time consuming and lacks real-time results to promote proactive response to water contamination. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have since been considered a promising alternative to complement conventional monitoring processes. These networks are relatively affordable and allow measurements to be taken remotely, in real-time and with minimal human intervention.

In essence, SIoT adapts a service-oriented architecture where heterogeneous IoT devices can offer or request autonomous services and collaborate on behalf of their owners. Operating Systems (OSs) are employed in IoT devices as they offer portability, threading support and access to development libraries; thus allowing easiness in IoT application development. Several OSs are available for IoT devices, but selecting an OS and hardware befitting for a particular IoT application is a critical task. In case of SIoT, the specific OS selection for hardware devices in various applications is even more challenging because of their collaborative nature. Existing surveys on OSs are mostly domain oriented and lack the discussion on hardware architectural features. As a consequence, it is infeasible for developers to choose best-suited OS for various hardware platforms which results in their underperformance in many application scenarios. This paper considers standard features of OS as well as hardware IoT platforms and provides an OS-to-hardware architectures features-mapping while exploring the unique requirements of SIoT applications. In doing so, resource-constrained IoT devices are particularly emphasized due to their memory constraints and power limitations. Further, a model OS architecture is proposed for devices in SIoT applications and associated open research challenges are identified. This research will benefit developers to best utilize IoT platform resources and to envisage an efficient OS for futuristic SIoT applications.",

With the CL2M (Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management) concept, there are also flows going backward, enabling better visibility and control of the product throughout its PLC (Product Life Cycle). CL2M uses “intelligent products” to gather information at any instant of the PLC and to make it available on downstream or upstream PLC phases. However, the information is often deported on a database and is accessed remotely via a network pointer carried by the product. To bring the CL2M concept a step further, this paper addresses a dual challenge: (i) providing a new kind of intelligent material capable of undergoing physical transformations without losing its communication ability and the data that is stored on it, (ii) providing a framework to achieve a high degree of data synchronization (i.e. enabling data updates on the product, regardless of the network availability).

The system results from an integration of two previously released applications: a tele-diagnosis system (TEDIST) and a smartphone based emergency report system (SPEARS). The functionality of these separate systems have been integrated and enhanced with a speech-to-text function, which users (or potential patients) apply to communicate with the system by speaking into their phones. A rule-based expert system is controlled by medical professionals regarding the automated diagnosis results. The emergency response component can communicate with local emergency services from hospitals and other organizations in order to find the nearest facility for help and support in case of emergency. Tests of the user interface and system tests have been carried out and have shown encouraging results.",

abstract = "Background and objective
Elderly populations are more prone to diseases and need continuous monitoring of parameters to ensure good health. Wearable devices (WDs) can be helpful in the early detection and management of medical conditions. However, less is known about the use of currently available WDs among elderly populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the usefulness and actual use of wearable devices among the elderly population.
Methods
Our methodology was based on a systematic review and a survey questionnaire. In the systematic review, search was conducted in four databases PubMed, MDPI, Sage, and Scopus with search terms “wearable device” and “elderly”, “wearable sensor” and “elderly”. The inclusion criteria were the studies which described health-related wearable devices, its use as the outcome, conducted on a minimum of ten participants and published in the last five years. The survey was conducted on the MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) platform. The questionnaire was related to the use of technology, intention to use, security and privacy concerns, and willingness to pay.
Results
The review identified 4915 articles, of which, 31 studies eventually met the inclusion criteria. All studies reported positive impacts after assessing devices, despite certain drawbacks. The majority of the samples were males. The survey revealed responses from 233 individuals out of the 1100 participants of the course. The survey results were categorized into two age groups: 54.3% were elderly (>65 years) and 45.49% were non-elderly (≤65 years). Very few elderly people were currently using WD. More than 60% of elderly people were interested in the future use of wearable devices, and preferred future use to improve physical and mental activities. A majority of the respondents were female.
Conclusions
This study suggests awareness should be created among elderly populations regarding the use of WDs for the early detection and prevention of complications and emergencies. Elderly populations are more prone to benefits from using WDs. The review concluded that devices should be tested on elderly groups as well, considering sex equality, and on both healthy and sick participants for better insights. The survey determined the elderly as frequent users of technology, but lack of knowledge of WD and demonstrated female interest in the use of WD. In future research on WDs, it is suggested that clinical studies be conducted for longer durations, and standard protocols such as age and sex equality should be considered. Requirements from both users and physicians should be acknowledged for better cognizance of WDs.",

First-hand knowledge of sensor data producers and disaster decision-makers is used, disclosing serious technical barriers to interoperable access to the highly disparate organizational sensor data. The findings also uncover the mechanisms in use for integrating multi-agency sensory information in disaster management, revealing the capabilities required of stakeholders to derive disaster information from raw sensor feeds.",

At the same time, however, questions arise about the impact of such technologies on system safety, operator performance, and decision processes, in settings where safe and effective performance are of paramount importance. Wearable, immersive augmented reality (WIAR) technology is one such technology whose introduction sparks these questions. Despite the proliferation of WIAR technology in safety-critical settings, few studies have examined its impacts on operator performance, decision processes and situation awareness in these settings. As a result, this paper considers research needs for evaluating WIAR technology in safety-critical systems. To illustrate the research needed, we consider the use case of a WIAR technology in marine navigation, and propose a research framework, summarizing research needs and identifying needed next steps.",

As automated vehicle (AV) technologies advance and emerge within a ubiquitous cyber-physical world they raise additional issues that have not yet been adequately defined, let alone researched. Issues around automation, sociotechnical complexity and systems resilience are well known in the context of aviation and space. There are important lessons that could be drawn from these applications to help inform the development of automated driving. This paper argues that for the foreseeable future, regardless of the level of automation, a driver will continue to have a role.

The performance of the energy harvester is validated by numerical simulations and detail electrical characterization. The electrical characterization results show that measured power density of the device is 10μW/mm3. A comparison with prior published results of flexible EH shows that the device performance is very good with added advantage of biocompatibility.

abstract = "In home health care (HHC) services, nurses or professional caregivers are dispatched to patients’ homes to provide medical care services, such that each patient can stay at home to be treated periodically. The HHC problem consists of the nurse rostering problem (NRP) and the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), both of which are NP-hard problems, which are harder or equal to the hardest problem in the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem class and generally cannot be solved efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, the previous algorithmic approaches were designed to separately address NRP and VRPTW of the HHC problem. However, NRP and VRPTW of the HHC problem are intercorrelated, and their respective optimal objectives may be in conflict with each other in many cases. Additionally, the problem generally involves too many constraints to be solved, and most previous works did not address occurrence of sudden incidents in HHC services (e.g., a nurse or a patient suddenly requests for a leave, and a patient suddenly changes the time slot to be treated) such that the original nurse roster could become infeasible. Under constraints of nurse qualifications, working laws, nurse preferences, and vehicle routing, the first model considers nurse rostering and vehicle routing concurrently to minimize total costs of nurse overtime and vehicle routing. The second model extends the first model with rerostering caused by occurrence of sudden incidents. Harmony search algorithm (HSA) has been shown to perform better in solving NRPs than conventional metaheuristics, and hence this work proposes an improved HSA with genetic and saturation schemes, in which the solution representation is designed to concurrently determine nurse rostering and vehicle routing. For the second rerostering model, inheritance and immigrant schemes are added to the HSA to adapt to the change caused by occurrence of sudden incidents. Experimental results show that the proposed HSA performs well and can adapt to the change caused by sudden incidents.",

However, the limited memory and communication bandwidth offered by WSN platforms comprise a significant shortcoming to such demanding application scenarios. Although, data compression can mitigate such deficiencies there is a lack of objective and comprehensive evaluation of relative approaches and even more on specialized approaches targeting specific demanding applications. The research work presented in this paper focuses on implementing and offering an in-depth experimental study regarding prominent, already existing as well as novel proposed compression algorithms. All algorithms have been implemented in a common Matlab framework. A major contribution of this paper, that differentiates it from similar research efforts, is the employment of real world Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) datasets comprising the two most demanding Epilepsy modalities. Emphasis is put on WSN applications, thus the respective metrics focus on compression rate and execution latency for the selected datasets. The evaluation results reveal significant performance and behavioral characteristics of the algorithms related to their complexity and the relative negative effect on compression latency as opposed to the increased compression rate. It is noted that the proposed schemes managed to offer considerable advantage especially aiming to achieve the optimum tradeoff between compression rate-latency. Specifically, proposed algorithm managed to combine highly completive level of compression while ensuring minimum latency thus exhibiting real-time capabilities. Additionally, one of the proposed schemes is compared against state-of-the-art general-purpose compression algorithms also exhibiting considerable advantages as far as the compression rate is concerned.",

However, its power density is very low which makes it crucial to have a high gain antenna to increase the power received by the system. This study presents the design of miniature high gain dielectric resonator antenna for RF energy harvesting application with high figure of merit to increase the power received. Numerical approximation is used to assist the antenna design and modelling. The design focused on three parameters which are the width, length, and height of the dielectric resonator. The performance, electric field density, and the radiation patterns of the dielectric resonator antenna have been observed by varying the design parameters. The effect of air gap to the performance is investigated and it is found that 8.11–13% gain improvement and up to 36% improvement in impedance matching is achieved through incorporating thin air gap between the dielectric resonator. Soda-lime glass with relative permittivity 7.75 is used which allows miniaturization and transparency. Experimental results show reasonable agreement to the simulations. The work shows highest antenna gain with smallest size with high FOM at 5 GHz ISM band compared to previous works.",

Experts in the purchasing and management of hospital supplies (administrative and clinical) were invited to participate at different stages of the ontology-based system development. As a result of the first stage, the HealthCatalog ontology was developed. This ontology models generic items included in a health catalog and their management. Secondly, a further refinement of the ontology was conducted by specifically studying the case of gloves. Twenty-seven references of different glove types were modeled and included in the ontology during the stage two. A prototype was then developed as a proof of concept and for the evaluation of the ontology. Finally, a usability evaluation was planned to improve the ontology and obtain feedback from experts after testing the system. Experts involved in the evaluation stressed its potential use in a real clinical environment and the benefits it would bring in terms of cost and sharing knowledge among clinical personnel. Our proposed ontology-based system provides an understandable and organized solution to capture knowledge regarding item management and usage. It addresses the integration challenge of health catalogs while providing a framework for collaborative sharing and knowledge acquisition among clinicians.",

Current network solutions are not designed to connect a large number of co-located devices with different characteristics and network requirements. To cope with increasingly large and heterogeneous networks, this paper presents an ‘incentive driven’ networking approach that optimizes the network performance by taking into account the network goals (‘incentives’) of all individual devices. Incentive driven networking consists of the following steps. First, devices dynamically search for co-located devices with similar network preferences and hardware and/or software capabilities. Next, if such devices are found, communities consisting of interconnected objects with similar network expectations are formed on an ad hoc basis. Due to the similarities between the involved devices, it is easier to optimize the network performance of each individual community. Finally, different communities can cooperate with each other by activating and sharing (software or hardware) network resources. The paper describes which (future) research is needed to realize this vision and illustrates the concepts with a number of simple algorithms. Through an experimental proof-of-concept implementation with two networks of resource-constrained embedded devices, it is shown that even these simple algorithms already result in improved network performance. Finally, the paper describes a large number of example use cases that can potentially benefit from our innovative networking methodology.",

An innovation model can incorporate those three components to provide greater value to stakeholders, drive organizational growth, gain a competitive advantage and achieve greater end-user satisfaction. We investigated how an enterprise systems model for open innovation could be created based on existing innovation socio-technical frameworks and how that model may benefit the UK National Health Service (NHS). We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the NHS is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments. The model strategy comprises rewarding people with shopping vouchers (Tesco club card points or nectar points) each time they confirm or cancel a medical appointment online or by SMS text message. With this model, the NHS would improve the management of their resources, may improve the quality of service and may have higher user satisfaction. Nevertheless, future challenges may include the adaptation of current NHS business processes and the management of the collaboration with private organizations.",

abstract = "Background
In recent years, the literature associated with healthcare big data has grown rapidly, but few studies have used bibliometrics and a visualization approach to conduct deep mining and reveal a panorama of the healthcare big data field.
Methods
To explore the foundational knowledge and research hotspots of big data research in the field of healthcare informatics, this study conducted a series of bibliometric analyses on the related literature, including papers’ production trends in the field and the trend of each paper’s co-author number, the distribution of core institutions and countries, the core literature distribution, the related information of prolific authors and innovation paths in the field, a keyword co-occurrence analysis, and research hotspots and trends for the future.
Results
By conducting a literature content analysis and structure analysis, we found the following: (a) In the early stage, researchers from the United States, the People’s Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany made the most contributions to the literature associated with healthcare big data research and the innovation path in this field. (b) The innovation path in healthcare big data consists of three stages: the disease early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis phase, the life and health promotion phase, and the nursing phase. (c) Research hotspots are mainly concentrated in three dimensions: the disease dimension (e.g., epidemiology, breast cancer, obesity, and diabetes), the technical dimension (e.g., data mining and machine learning), and the health service dimension (e.g., customized service and elderly nursing).
Conclusion
This study will provide scholars in the healthcare informatics community with panoramic knowledge of healthcare big data research, as well as research hotspots and future research directions.",

abstract = "Wider availability of sensors and sensing systems has pushed research in the direction of automatic activity recognition (AR) either for medical or other personal benefits e.g. wellness or fitness monitoring. Researchers apply different AR techniques/algorithms and use a wide range of sensors to discover home activities. However, it seems that the AR algorithms are purely technology-driven rather than informing studies on the type and quality of input required. There is an expectation to over-instrument the environment or the subjects and then develop AR algorithms, where instead the problem should be approached from a different angle i.e. what sensors (type, quality and quantity) a given algorithm requires to infer particular activities with a certain confidence? This paper introduces the concept of activity recognition, its taxonomy and familiarises the reader with sub-classes of sensor-based AR. Furthermore, it presents an overview of existing health services Telecare and Telehealth solutions, and introduces the hierarchical taxonomy of human behaviour analysis tasks. This work is a result of a systematic literature review and it presents the reader with a comprehensive set of home-based activities of daily living (ADL) and sensors proven to recognise these activities. Apart from reviewing usefulness of various sensing technologies for home-based AR algorithms, it highlights the problem of technology-driven cycle of development in this area.",

In departing from the traditional centralized model of manufacturing, decentralized manufacturing divides production across sites or geographic regions. This paradigm shift imposes significant structural and organisational changes on a business presenting both hidden challenges that must be addressed and opportunities to be embraced. By profoundly adapting business practices, significant advantages can be realized through a democratized value chain, creation of professional-level jobs without geographic restriction to the central hub and a flexibility in response to external pressures and demands. To realize these potential opportunities, however, advances in manufacturing technology and support systems are required, as well as significant changes in the way CGTs are regulated to facilitate multi-site manufacturing. Decentralized manufacturing is likely to be the manufacturing platform of choice for advanced health care therapies—in particular, those with a high degree of personalization. The future success of these promising products will be enhanced by adopting sound business strategies early in development. To realize the benefits that decentralized manufacturing of CGTs has to offer, it is important to examine both the risks and the substantial opportunities present. In this research, we examine both the challenges and the opportunities this shift in business strategy represents in an effort to maximize the success of adoption.",

In this study, a meta review of the studies published in academic journals from 1971 to 2016 was conducted to analyze the application domains, subjects, adopted learning strategies, investigated research issues and findings of mobile technology-supported nursing education. From the review results, it was found that the use of mobile technologies in nursing education and training have made great progress in the past decades. In addition to the changes in mobile technologies and the increasing number of mobile learning studies in nursing education, the subjects and research issues have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that mobile learning has mainly been applied to the training of basic nursing concepts and skills as well as to long-term care and obstetrics and gynecology, while few or even no studies are related to other nursing education domains. In addition, several widely adopted mobile learning strategies, such as inquiry-based learning, contextual mobile learning, snychronous sharing, Mindtools, project-based learning and peer assessment, have seldom been adopted in mobile nursing education. This also reflects the fact that most of these studies focused on skills training and basic knowledge comprehension, while few were conducted in the domains aimed at fostering learners' higher order thinking competences, such as problem solving or critical thinking. On the other hand, it was found that the number of studies using an experimental design has increased in recent years; moreover, most studies reported the learners’ cognitive performance and perceptions, while their learning behaviors were seldom analyzed. Accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of mobile nursing education are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors and policy makers.",

Modern urban agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. The currently popular notion of ‘smart cities’ aims to provide a new perspective for sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our ‘urban century’. In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called ‘urban piazza’ strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of ‘big digital data’ management in urban systems.",

Those activities will be, in the near future, the foundations of the emerging Internet of Living Things. The concept of Internet of Living Things has been introduced to characterize networks of biological sequencing sensors, which could rely on cloud-based analysis capabilities, to support the users in deeply studying DNA or other molecules. Sequencing sensors have many fields of application and much more will likely to come. In this context, DNA microarray images represent the core of modern genomic data analysis, since they allow the simultaneous monitoring of many thousands of genes and represent a sort of “container”, not only for storing genomics data, but also for managing, sharing and exchanging such type of data. In this scenario, the ability to protect genomics and medical big data is a growing challenge. In particular, for what concerns DNA microarray images, the techniques commonly employed for data protection are not effective due for example to the unauthorized use or manipulation after decryption or the lost of metadata during image processing. In this paper we address the problem of protecting such type of information, by means of watermarking techniques. In particular, we propose reversible watermarking techniques explicitly tailored for the characteristics of DNA microarray images to ensure the protection of such images in terms of authenticity and integrity, besides enabling the binding of those imaging data with other information related to them. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques by means of a working prototype.",

abstract = "Purpose
The aim is the first application of Singular Spectrum Analysis for computer processing of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). An illustration of the method advantages is the additional objective.
Method
The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a way of trend and seasonality extraction. SSA is suitable for short series with noises. It is also useful for the variability analysis. As well, it is simply programmable in a high-level programming language. Here Maple 18 was in use.
Results
Trends and the slowest oscillations were obtained within a case study. The error of SSA estimations turned out to be close to the exactness of measuring. However, these errors are in good agreement with the known descriptors of the short-time variability. The periods of the slowest oscillations were different for the systolic and the diastolic pressures. Seasonality was about six months and about two months respectively. We found the amplitude of the slowest oscillations of heart rate varies in time. This fact is in contrast to the blood pressure fluctuations, for which the amplitudes are stable.
Conclusions
SSA is a promising tool for HBPM data processing. It ensures smooth and readable trends as well as shows the long-term variability of series. This information can be usable for clinical decision-making and prognostics.",

This is the first Asia-wide study of prostate cancer and has developed from single country research efforts in this field, including in Japan and Korea. At the Second Meeting, participating countries and regions discussed the status of preparations and discussed various issues that are being faced. These issues include technical challenges in creating databases, promoting participation in each country or region, clarifying issues relating to data input, addressing institutional issues such as institutional review board requirements, and the need for dedicated data managers. The meeting was positioned as an opportunity to share information and address outstanding issues prior to the initiation of the study.

However, in order to ensure a good monitoring, high bandwidth and low delay are needed. The 5G technology offers higher bandwidth, lower delays and packets loss than previous technologies. This paper presents an architecture for smart eHealth monitoring of chronic patients. The architecture elements include wearable devices, to collect measures from the body, and a smartphone at the patient side in order to process the data received from the wearable devices. We also need a DataBase with an intelligent system able to send an alarm when it detects that it is happening something anomalous. The intelligent system uses machine learning in BigData taken from different hospitals and the data received from the patient to diagnose and generate alarms. Experiment tests have been done to simulate the traffic from many users to the DataBase in order to evaluate the suitability of 5G in our architecture. When there are few users (less than 200 users), we do not find big differences of round trip time between 4G and 5G, but when there are more users, like 1000 users, it increases considerably reaching 4 times more in 4G The Packet Loss is almost null in 4G until 300 users, while in 5G it is possible to keep it null until 700 users. Our results point out that in order to have high number of patients continuously monitored, it is necessary to use the 5G network because it offers low delays and guarantees the availability of bandwidth for all users.",

The objectives of this review were to evaluate the use of consumer-targeted wearable and mobile sleep monitoring technology, identify gaps in the literature and determine the potential for use in behavioral interventions. We undertook a scoping review of studies conducted in adult populations using consumer-targeted wearable technology or mobile devices designed to measure and/or improve sleep. After screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, data were extracted from the articles by two co-authors. Articles included in the search were using wearable or mobile technology to estimate or evaluate sleep, published in English and conducted in adult populations. Our search returned 3897 articles and 43 met our inclusion criteria. Results indicated that the majority of studies focused on validating technology to measure sleep (n = 23) or were observational studies (n = 10). Few studies were used to identify sleep disorders (n = 2), evaluate response to interventions (n = 3) or deliver interventions (n = 5). In conclusion, the use of consumer-targeted wearable and mobile sleep monitoring technology has largely focused on validation of devices and applications compared with polysomnography (PSG) but opportunities exist for observational research and for delivery of behavioral interventions. Multidisciplinary research is needed to determine the uses of these technologies in interventions as well as the use in more diverse populations including sleep disorders and other patient populations.",

abstract = "Purpose
The objective of this work is to design, implement and introduce the application of 32-channel system in the biomedical field. The main aim is to introduce the system application at homes in a domestic scale.
Design/methodology/approach
This research article covers the use of the 32-channel cost effective data acquisition device and its application software for the patient monitoring system. The design process includes knitting the sensors in the fiber to create a wearable fabric that can be fitted on a body for monitoring purposes.
Findings
Human body temperature, oxygen level around the body, ECG, EMG muscle signal and PH level detection using 32-channel system with LabVIEW front panel control for alarm triggering. The monitoring can be done remotely. Data is connected to the hospital server. All the graphical interface and simulation is created using LabVIEW. This application can be alternatively viewed as a Human Impact System.
Research limitations/implications
Digilent Chip KIT max32 is used since it rooms enough channel required for the interface software. Sensors such as ECG, EMG, Oxygen Pulse, PH and temp are knitted in the fiber of clothes to introduce a wear able fabric. The total of 32-channel is used by the complete application. Some channels are used for alerting in case, if the values from the sensors are abnormal.
Practical implications
Chip KIT Shield for connecting sensors, attaching the output pins to the LED indicators and display have been created. Circuitry for measuring temperature, pulse, oxygen level, PH, EMG, and ECG have been designed and printed. This application can be used at home. For the wearer, the temperature level of different body parts, heart ECG level, muscle pulses signals, oxygen level around the body and the PH can be detected and displayed remotely from the LabVIEW front panel screen. The desired alarm level can be set from the front panel for every specific sensor. For this step, virtual channels can be created for allowing the user to set any random value for alarm depending on the patient age. These custom alarm levels are for user’s own record, while the hospital works with the standard levels. Once the sensor value passes through the alarm value, then the corresponding alarm will be triggered. There are two modes for alarm. One is automatic and other is manual. In the manual mode, user will set the alarm itself whereas in, automatic mode, the system will use the basic decision making techniques.
Originality/value
Combining the field of biomedical, computer science and electrical engineering, this is the first research of its own sort utilizing the 32-channel system.",

abstract = "Over the past few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to transform urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services that make smart cities “smart” are curated by using data streams of smart cities i.e., inhabitants’ location information, digital engagement, transportation, environment and local government data. Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable attempts have been made to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants’ data. However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have their own reservations — service provider trust, reliability of the sensed data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning in smart cities, namely the ‘Smart Secure Service Provisioning’ (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition, transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The proposed framework ensures inhabitants’ privacy, and also guarantees integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols by an automated security verification tool called Scyther.",

Both tokenisation and P2PE have proved to be powerful ways of securing data, while EMV has established an essential global standard for the interoperability of chip cards. However in one sector these advances in security are not effective; for many, the challenge of how to secure card payments made over the phone to a contact centre still exists. That's why one payment protection method, DTMF masking, has come to take a pivotal role in the protection of customer card data when taking payments made over the phone. It has been 10 years since the launch of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and many advances have been made to help merchants comply. But one area remains vulnerable. For many, the challenge of how to secure ‘card not present’ (CNP) payments made over the phone to a contact centre still exists. Allowing customers to provide sensitive information such as card numbers on calls that may be recorded presents serious challenges. That's why one payment protection method, DTMF masking, has come to take a pivotal role, as Tim Critchley of Semafone explains.",

We provide a comprehensive survey of computational intelligence techniques appropriate for the effective processing and analysis of big data. We discuss a number of exemplar application areas that generate big data and can hence benefit from its effective processing. State of the art research and novel applications in health-care, intelligent transportation and social network sentiment analysis, are presented and discussed in the context of Big data, Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS), and Computational Intelligence (CI). We present a data modelling methodology, which introduces a novel biologically inspired universal generative modelling approach called Hierarchical Spatial–Temporal State Machine (HSTSM). The HSTSM modelling approach incorporates a number of soft computing techniques such as: deep belief networks, auto-encoders, agglomerative hierarchical clustering and temporal sequence processing, in order to address the computational challenges arising from analysing and processing large volumes of diverse data to provide an effective big data analytics tool for diverse application areas. A conceptual cyber–physical architecture, which can accommodate and benefit from the proposed methodology, is further presented.",

With the advent of the low-cost and very high performance digital processors and the reduction of the cost of memory chips it is clear that the techniques and application areas of soft computing will continue to expand. This paper gives an overview of the current state of soft computing techniques and describes the advantages and disadvantages of soft computing compared to traditional hard computing techniques.",

abstract = "Security and privacy of data are one of the prime concerns in today's embedded devices. Primitive security techniques like signature-based detection of malware and regular update of signature database are not feasible solutions as they cannot secure such systems, having limited resources, effectively. Furthermore, energy efficient wireless sensor modes running on batteries cannot afford the implementation of cryptography algorithms as such techniques have significant impact on the system power consumption. Therefore, in order to operate wireless embedded devices in a secure manner, the system must be able to detect and prevent any kind of intrusions before the network (i.e. sensor nodes and base station) is destabilized by the attackers. In this paper, we have presented an intrusion detection mechanism by implementing an intelligent security architecture using Random Neural Networks (RNN). To validate the feasibility of the proposed security solution, it is implemented for an existing wireless sensor network system and its functionality is practically demonstrated by successfully detecting the presence of any suspicious sensor node and anomalous activity in the base station with high accuracy and minimal performance overhead.",

We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyber–physical coupling design.",

In order to lead data-driven innovations, a market of data is expected to reduce the risks of data utilization, and encourage data exchange. Data Jacket (DJ) has been proposed as the technique for sharing the information about data by publishing the summary of datasets as meta-data. Even if the data itself is not open in public, DJs enable the stakeholders in the market of data to consider the latent value of datasets by understanding the information about data described on DJs. Datasets described in DJs have various sharing policies of data, such as Open Data from governments, or private data from companies or individuals. Although, in general, there is a preconception that “the fee-charging things are better than the free ones”, the relationship of sharing policies and the utility expectations of data has not discussed in the market of data. In this study, we examine which data is expected higher for utilizing, that is, comparing the utility expectation of the data which can be shared in public (Public Data) and the data which cannot be shared (Private Data). Observing the frequency of uses in Innovators Marketplace on Data Jackets, which is the gamified workshop for discussing the data utilization, and analyzing the number of views in DJ Store, which is the retrieval system of DJs, the result shows that the data which is hardly open may be recognized valuable for utilizing.",

While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.",

It calls for tools and approaches that could be easily embedded into everyday practices and able to combine complex methodologies with high usability requirements. In this perspective, the proposed research work is focused on the design and development of a practical solution, called Sophos-MS, able to integrate augmented reality contents and intelligent tutoring systems with cutting-edge fruition technologies for operators’ support in complex man-machine interactions. After establishing a reference methodological framework for the smart operator concept within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the proposed solution is presented, along with its functional and non-function requirements. Such requirements are fulfilled through a structured design strategy whose main outcomes include a multi-layered modular solution, Sophos-MS, that relies on Augmented Reality contents and on an intelligent personal digital assistant with vocal interaction capabilities. The proposed approach has been deployed and its training potentials have been investigated with field experiments. The experimental campaign results have been firstly checked to ensure their statistical relevance and then analytically assessed in order to show that the proposed solution has a real impact on operators’ learning curves and can make the difference between who uses it and who does not.",

After heating the spin-coated ink on PI and successive electroless deposition (ELD) of copper, a layer of copper with excellent adhesion is formed on PI substrate. The effects of this ink on catalyzing the ELD of copper and the mechanism for the enhancement of the adhesion between flexible PI substrate and copper layer are investigated by XPS and FT-IR. The copper coating plated by this method has a low resistivity (about 13.6 × 10−6 Ω cm) and satisfied endurance of bending. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the copper patterns can be prepared easily by integration of laser-direct patterning of the spin-coated ink and electroless Cu deposition, which is fast and effective strategy for fabricating circuit patterns on the plastic substrate.",

abstract = "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common cardiovascular disorder. It affects people of both genders at ages as young as 20 years. The increased number of VTE cases with a high fatality rate of 25% at first occurrence makes preventive measures essential. Clinical narratives are a rich source of knowledge and should be included in the diagnosis and treatment processes, as they may contain critical information on risk factors. It is very important to make such narrative blocks of information usable for searching, health analytics, and decision-making. This paper proposes a Semantic Extraction and Sentiment Assessment of Risk Factors (SESARF) framework. Unlike traditional machine-learning approaches, SESARF, which consists of two main algorithms, namely, ExtractRiskFactor and FindSeverity, prepares a feature vector as the input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to make a diagnosis. SESARF matches and maps the concepts of VTE risk factors and finds adjectives and adverbs that reflect their levels of severity. SESARF uses a semantic- and sentiment-based approach to analyze clinical narratives of electronic health records (EHR) and then predict a diagnosis of VTE. We use a dataset of 150 clinical narratives, 80% of which are used to train our prediction classifier support vector machine, with the remaining 20% used for testing. Semantic extraction and sentiment analysis results yielded precisions of 81% and 70%, respectively. Using a support vector machine, prediction of patients with VTE yielded precision and recall values of 54.5% and 85.7%, respectively.",

We describe the design and implementation of such platform that enables the deployment of services to follow-up the patient’s health status based on a set of monitored parameters per disease and to profile user’s habits and diagnose deviations from their usual activities. A key aspect of the platform is its Service Oriented Architecture middleware that collects data from heterogeneous Telecare and Telehealth gateways and provides the upper service layers with a unified and standards compliant message. In this way, an integrated view of Telehealth and Telecare data and alerts is made possible into a backend Web Portal where clinicians and operators have access to.",

abstract = "With the development of cloud computing and wireless body area networks (WBANs), wearable equipments are able to become new intelligent terminals to provide services for users, which plays an important role to improve the human health-care service. However, The traditional WBANs devices have limited computing and storage capabilities. These restrictions limit the services that WBANs can provide to users. Thus the concept of Cloud-aided WBANs has been proposed to enhance the capabilities of WBANs. In addition, due to the openness of the cloud computing environment, the protection of the user's physiological information and privacy remains a major concern. In previous authentication protocols, few of them can protect the user's private information in insecure channel. In this paper, we propose a cloud-aided lightweight certificateless authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless body area networks. Our protocol ensures that no one can obtain user's real identity except for the network manager in the registration phase. Moreover, in the authentication phase, the network manager cannot know the user's real identity. Note that, through the security analysis, we can conclude that our protocol can provide stronger security protection of private information than most of existing schemes in insecure channel.",

abstract = "Today, healthcare providers are experiencing explosive growth in data. Although the dramatic increase in the use of medical imaging technologies has been a major contributor to healthcare data growth in the past decade, more recently the rising adoption of sensing devices, enabling people to collect health-related data independently at any time or place is leading to a torrent of sensor data. The scale and richness of the sensor data currently being collected and analysed is rapidly growing. The key challenges that we will be facing are how to effectively manage and make use of this abundance of easily generated and diverse health data. This paper explores the potential for sensors use in healthcare data acquisition and presents the next evolution in the on-going development of Wiki-Health, a big data service platform, designed to address the larger problem of explosive growth in healthcare information by providing a unified solution for collecting, storing, tagging, retrieving, searching and analysing personal health sensor data. Additionally, the platform is designed to allow users to reuse and remix data, along with analysis results and analysis models, to make health-related knowledge discovery more available to individual users–including health professionals, patients or even individuals who desire to maintain an optimum level of personal health–on a massive scale. To tackle the challenge of efficiently managing the high volume and diversity of big data, Wiki-Health introduces a hybrid data storage model capable of storing structured, semi-structured and unstructured sensor data and sensor metadata separately. The design of such a hybrid model allows Wiki-Health to potentially handle heterogeneous formats of sensor data. In addition to its data management capabilities, we envision the potential for Wiki-Health as a system that also enables health sensor data monitoring and analysis, not only as a method of tracking existing health conditions but also as a means of encouraging a more pro-active approach to healthcare through early detection. To tackle the scalability and performance challenges of real-time analysis, the Analysis Tasks Allocation Scheme proposed in the research aids the management of data analysis tasks on a large scale and utilises the elastic nature of cloud infrastructure by considering the aspects of performance and cost. To evaluate the proposed Wiki-Health approach, we have developed an ECG-based health monitoring service on top of the Wiki-Health platform. The positive performance of the approach is supported by the results obtained in our experimental trials and shows significant potential for real-world applications.",

abstract = "Background and objective
Computerized epileptic seizure detection is essential for expediting epilepsy diagnosis and research and for assisting medical professionals. Moreover, the implementation of an epilepsy monitoring device that has low power and is portable requires a reliable and successful seizure detection scheme. In this work, the problem of automated epilepsy seizure detection using singe-channel EEG signals has been addressed.
Methods
At first, segments of EEG signals are decomposed using a newly proposed signal processing scheme, namely complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Six spectral moments are extracted from the CEEMDAN mode functions and train and test matrices are formed afterward. These matrices are fed into the classifier to identify epileptic seizures from EEG signal segments. In this work, we implement an ensemble learning based machine learning algorithm, namely linear programming boosting (LPBoost) to perform classification.
Results
The efficacy of spectral features in the CEEMDAN domain is validated by graphical and statistical analyses. The performance of CEEMDAN is compared to those of its predecessors to further inspect its suitability. The effectiveness and the appropriateness of LPBoost are demonstrated as opposed to the commonly used classification models. Resubstitution and 10 fold cross-validation error analyses confirm the superior algorithm performance of the proposed scheme. The algorithmic performance of our epilepsy seizure identification scheme is also evaluated against state-of-the-art works in the literature. Experimental outcomes manifest that the proposed seizure detection scheme performs better than the existing works in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient.
Conclusion
It can be anticipated that owing to its use of only one channel of EEG signal, the proposed method will be suitable for device implementation, eliminate the onus of clinicians for analyzing a large bulk of data manually, and expedite epilepsy diagnosis.",

Secondly, the attacker has limitless and authorized access to the target. Thirdly, all major protections stand up to a determined attacker till a certain period of time. Digital assets range from business to personal use, from consumer devices to home networks, the public Internet, the cloud, and the Internet of Things – where traditional computer and network security are inadequate to address MATE attacks. MATE is fundamentally a hard problem. Much of the extant focus to deal with MATE attacks is purely technical; though security is more than just a technical issue. The main objective of the paper is to mitigate the consequences of MATE attacks through the human element of security and highlight the need for this element to form a part of a holistic security strategy alongside the necessary techniques and technologies. This paper contributes by taking software protection (SP) research to a new realm of challenges. Moreover, the paper elaborates the concept of MATE attacks, the different forms, and the analysis of MATE versus insider threats to present a thematic taxonomy of a MATE attack. The ensuing paper also highlights the fundamental concept of digital assets, and the core protection mechanisms and their qualitative comparison against MATE attacks. Finally, we present state-of-the-art trends and cutting-edge future research directions by taking into account only the human aspects for young researchers and professionals.",

In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system.",

Risk calculation methods and examples are introduced in this paper to measure cost-effectiveness of control factors, articulate an entity's “willingness-to-pay” (risk pricing) for cyber risk reduction, cyber risk limit, and cyber risk appetite. Built around BM and hekla, cybernomics integrates cyber risk management and economics to study the requirements of a databank in order to improve risk analytics solutions for: 1) the valuation of digital assets; 2) the measurement of risk exposure of digital assets; and 3) the capital optimization for managing residual cyber risk. Establishing adequate, holistic and statistically robust data points on the entity, portfolio and global levels for the development of a cybernomics databank are essential for the resilience of our shared digital future. This paper explains the need to establish data schemes such as International Digital Asset Classification (IDAC) and International Classification of Cyber Incidents (ICCI).",

Hype draws attention to potential positive effects while excluding or under emphasizing a new technology's dependencies on other factors and its potential negative effects. Thus, hype presents a partial picture of technological innovation. In this paper, it is argued that dependencies and potential negative effects should be, and can be, included in the framing of new technologies. First, the limitations of hype are described with references to cases. Next, a template is provided to summarize big picture innovation framing. Dependencies for effectiveness and dependencies for efficient operation are included. This is because the potential of technological innovations to bring about positive effects is often dependent upon extraneous factors. Also, their efficient operation is often dependent upon many inter-related technological components. Potential negative effects are also included. Big picture framing is contrasted with the partial picture provided by hype. Then, examples of dependencies and potential negative effects are described for a range of technologies. Subsequently, a full example of big picture framing is provided for a hyped technology. In conclusion, it is argued that big picture framing can be a more informative starting point for understanding the potential of new technologies than vague hyperbole.",

In light of the use of the problem, we specify six issues of knowledge fusion and inference and propose a HyKFICE (Hybrid Knowledge Fusion and Inference on Cloud Environment) system as an effective solution. HyKFICE is capable of inferring the possibilities of the presence of items at a given condition through knowledge fusion and inference based on the probability theory. HyKFICE can also perform the computation in parallel on clouds by grouping and summing up similar knowledge in 3-layer bipartite graphs. Experiments conducted on real data sets demonstrate the efficiency of HyKFICE and show that it is not only the amount of knowledge but also the associations between knowledge dominating the execution time of the hybrid knowledge fusion and inference.",

Our perspectives are based on fundamental similarities between natural and business systems. We suggest that innovation ecosystems can be defined as pathways of interlinked business models. Pathways are characterised by the flows they convey not the types of business model that support the flows. These pathways convey material and informational resources, as well as value. Like the nutrient and energy pathways in natural ecosystems. Pathways help to recycle scarce resources such as customer attention and customer-derived information. Business model descriptions are similar to an organism's genome in that they describe limitations on sensing, acting and understanding. We conceptualise this as the ‘umwelt’; the self-world. These limitations have implications for how firms and customers interact with customers. They have other implications for how firms interact with each other in business model communities and how they accommodate each other. We illustrate and test these ecological perspectives using a case study of a healthcare smartphone app's ecosystem. We find that our perspectives can be used as novel methods of studying interactions between business models; or to study ecosystem building.",

As an energy harvester to power wearable electronic devices, a flexible thermoelectric generator (f-TEG) can utilize human body heat as the energy source, creating an ideal solution. The f-TEG can make conformal contact to the human skin and fully utilize body heat with minimal energy loss, while also being comfortable to wear. However, to maximize the power generated by an f-TEG attached to the human body, a careful thermal and structural design analysis of the f-TEG must be carried out. Here, we fabricated flexible thermoelectric generators (f-TEGs) with different device parameters and evaluated their power generating performance using an artificial arm, which was carefully designed to mimic a real human arm. We demonstrated the impact of the f-TEG device parameters on the power generation performance under various circumstances. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical model, and guidelines for an optimum device design in terms of maximizing the generated power density are also presented. Finally, we show that the optimum device structure varies when the efficiency of the power management IC (PMIC) is included in the analysis of the power generation system, which is practically important.",

The textile MFC used Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as a biocatalyst to generate the maximum power and current density of 1.0µW/cm2 and 6.3µA/cm2, respectively, which are comparable with or even higher than other flexible MFCs such as paper-based devices (~ a few µW/cm2). Additionally, the textile MFC generated consistent power even with repeated 70 cycles of 50% stretching. A simple batch fabrication method simultaneously produced 20 individual 2cm × 2cm devices by using brushing, spraying, ironing, and computerized sewing, a process that will revolutionize the mass production of textile MFCs. This achievement is scientifically meaningful because developing textile MFCs requires integration of both electronic and fluidic components into the textile three-dimensionally. This flexible and stretchable energy harvesting device is expected to be easily integrated with the next generation stretchable electronics for realizing low-power, stand-alone, self-sustainable systems.",

While a variety of treatment options are available, ranging from pharmaceutical drugs to invasive neuromodulation, the clinical effects are inconsistent and often poorly measured. For instance, the lack of remote monitoring has been a major limitation to optimize therapeutic interventions for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). In this work, we focus on the assessment of full-body tremor as the most recognized PD symptom. Forty PD and twenty two healthy participants were recruited. The main assessment tool was an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion capture system to quantify full-body tremor and to separate tremor-dominant from non-tremor-dominant PD patients as well as from healthy controls. We developed a new measure and evaluated its clinical utility by correlating the results with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores as the gold standard. Significant correlation was observed between the UPDRS and the tremor severity scores for the selected tasks. The results suggest that it is feasible and clinically meaningful to utilize the suggested objective tremor score for the assessment of PD patients. Furthermore, this portable assessment tool could potentially be used in the home environment to monitor PD tremor and facilitate optimizing therapeutic interventions.",

Existing review articles generally utilise medical literature and categories: none investigates M-health from an information systems (IS) design point of view. Identifying application areas, design issues and IS research techniques will demonstrate models, issues, approaches and gaps to inform future research. A comprehensive analysis of the literature from this viewpoint is thus valuable, both for theoretical progression and for guiding real-world innovative system developments. Drawing from key IS and healthcare multidisciplinary journals we analyse recent (2010–2016) articles concerning M-health application developments and their associated design or development issues, with particular focus on the use of contemporary research methods. Our analysis suggests that M-health is an emerging field to which, although underused, contemporary approaches such as design science research are particularly appropriate. We identify eight application categories, eleven design issues (security, privacy, literacy, accessibility, acceptability, reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, knowledge sharing and flexibility) as well as the stakeholders and development techniques involved. This goes beyond previous frameworks, and theoretically integrates the central role of IS design within the sub-field.",

abstract = "Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) as a major hazardous constituent is strongly associated with household energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the PM2.5 footprint of household energy consumption in Beijing based on input–output analysis. An inventory of primary and secondary household energy consumption is developed to quantify the direct PM2.5 emissions. The household PM2.5 footprint is then traced through goods or services that ultimately consumed by households to unveil the indirect PM2.5 emissions triggered by economic activities. PM2.5 fingerprint is also proposed to describe the characteristic of household PM2.5 footprint. Results show that PM2.5 footprint of Beijing households in 2010 is 7831.36 kt, of which 92.61% is contributed by urban households. The source of direct PM2.5 emissions in urban area is diversified, which is composed of coal (42.07%), heat and electricity (32.83%), gasoline (21.29%), natural gas (3.04%) and liquefied petroleum gas (0.77%), while in rural area, coal (98.09%) plays a dominant role. The indirect PM2.5 accounts for 99.96% of the total footprint in urban area, about one third of which is contributed by sectors of “Food Processing and Production”, “Healthcare and Social Security”, and “Farming, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Fishery”. The disparity between urban and rural households PM2.5 footprints is further evaluated with income levels. The PM2.5 footprint from living expenditures of urban households is found to be nearly twice as much as that of rural households. Such inventory of PM2.5 footprint and examination of drivers for PM2.5 emissions may be essential for urban pollution mitigation policy.",

abstract = "Background
Workers at tertiary health facilities may be expected to have good knowledge of cervical cancer and also good screening practices so that they could be good sources of health information and motivation to promote screening in the general public. An assessment of their perceptions and practice of cervical screening could reveal gaps that would inspire efforts to improve key indicators among them and in turn, the general population.
Methods
This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 316 workers of a tertiary health facility selected by stratified random sampling with proportionate allocation. Data was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires and analysed with SPSS 20 and PEPI programs.
Results
The majority of respondents were aware of cervical cancer but it was significantly higher among females, p=.001. Most respondents, 266 (84.2%) were less than 40 years of age but knowledge of cervical cancer screening diminished with increase in age, p=.039. Only 92 (29%) had good knowledge of cervical screening; a better knowledge of cervical screening was significantly associated with working in a clinical department, employment duration of less than 2 years, and being female. All females who had ever screened for Ca cervix, 18 (11%) had a Pap smear, and majority 15 (83%) had screened only once. Factors associated with screening were level of education, years of work experience, and being in a clinical department. Reasons given for not screening included pain from the procedure, its cost, and the delay with getting results.
Conclusion
Knowledge of cervical screening was not good among staff of DELSUTH and practice of screening was also very poor. They may benefit from health education and promotion programmes directed towards better screening practices. Introduction of easier-to-perform and less costly screening modalities like VIA/VILI may also improve uptake.",

Some of them include data generated from geospatial, geographical, medical, weather, finance and environmental applications. Such data objects changes over time. Conventional knowledge discovery techniques available do not address the need for analyzing such complex datasets and hence data analysis has become increasingly complex and challenging. Soft computing principles such as fuzzy logic, evolutionary and nature inspired computations may be applied to analyze dynamically varying data. Analyzing temporal trends of association patterns requires handling the temporal data, as prevalence values of temporal patterns are implicitly vectors. Finding Prevalence values of temporal association patterns and validating them for similarity using conventional approach increases the computational complexity. This makes it challenging as the conventional data mining algorithms do not address this need. In this research, we propose a novel approach for estimation of temporal association pattern prevalence values and a novel temporal fuzzy similarity measure which holds monotonicity to find similarity between any two temporal patterns. Experiments are performed considering naive, sequential, spamine and proposed approach. The results obtained show the proposed approach is promising and reduces computational complexity in terms of computing true prevalence and optimizing execution times.",

Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.",

A flexible broadband OPD array is printed on PEN substrate by blade-coating PEDOT:PSS, a polyethylenimine cathode interlayer and the photo-active layer, and screen-printing on top a patterned PEDOT:PSS anode. The OPD array achieves an average EQE of ∼37% at -4 V bias over the whole visible spectrum, 5 orders of magnitude of linear dynamic range (LDR), a 0.5 nA/cm2 dark current, and maintains these performances in ambient conditions for more than 30 h. Pixels detecting “White”, “Yellow” and “Red” are fabricated by spray-coating two color filters. The substrate is used as a separator between the filters and OPD array. This physical separation allows solution processing of the filters regardless of their electrical properties or of the compatibility of their solvents with the OPD, thus broadening the choice of filter materials while offering a simple fabrication process. The combination of broadband OPD and broadband filters used in this configuration can significantly simplify the fabrication of spectrally-selective photosensors and full-color imagers.",

Data congestion could take place in WSNs with a large number of nodes sending data periodically, or in WSNs where the data rate can increase when a specific event is detected.

This problem, known as blind deconvolution, pervades many areas of science and technology, including astronomy, medical imaging, optics, and wireless communications. A key challenge of this intricate non-convex optimization problem is that it might exhibit many local minima. We present an efficient numerical algorithm that is guaranteed to recover the exact solution, when the number of measurements is (up to log-factors) slightly larger than the information-theoretical minimum, and under reasonable conditions on f and g. The proposed regularized gradient descent algorithm converges at a geometric rate and is provably robust in the presence of noise. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first blind deconvolution algorithm that is numerically efficient, robust against noise, and comes with rigorous recovery guarantees under certain subspace conditions. Moreover, numerical experiments do not only provide empirical verification of our theory, but they also demonstrate that our method yields excellent performance even in situations beyond our theoretical framework.",

However, in healthcare, such practices, beyond elicitation, are immature. The introduction of changes to existing healthcare processes or e-systems often fails because users’ needs and operational/organizational goals may not get satisfied. In addition, healthcare is moving toward a value-based paradigm that requires a comprehensive evaluation and re-engineering of current processes, which puts more pressure on healthcare professionals to apply advanced RE techniques, such as goal and process modeling, in order to obtain much desired results effectively. In this paper, we discuss the integration of new technology-depending processes, e.g., that come with off-the-shelf solutions, with existing healthcare processes. We propose the use of an Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) framework to investigate the impact of each potential integration on the organizational goals and user satisfaction. Performance indicators are used to reason about measurable quantities beyond goal satisfaction. The paper implements the AbPI approach with the User Requirement Notation standard and illustrates its feasibility with a real example related to wait time indication in an emergency room.

Consequently, data confidentiality and user privacy are primary concerns for WBANs. In order to achieve these goals, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs based on low-entropy password and prove its security in the random oracle model. Our scheme enjoys strong anonymity in the sense that only the client knows his identity during the authentication phase of the scheme. Compared with other related proposals, our scheme is efficient in terms of computation. Moreover, the authentication of the client relies on human-rememberable password, which makes our scheme more suitable for applications in WBANs.",

The aim is to technically advance and combine several technologies and integrate them as integral part of a personnel safety system to improve safety, maintain availability, reduce errors and decrease the time needed for scheduled or ad hoc interventions. We emphasize on the aspects that were made “feasible” on the worker's side due to the equipment used (mobile computing equipment). We present that the demanding tasks that previously were simply undertaken on the fixed infrastructure are now possible on the mobile end. The research challenges lie in the development of real-time data-transmission, instantaneous analysis of data coming from different inputs, local intelligence in low power embedded systems, interaction with multiple on-site users, complex user interfaces, portability and wearability.

A frequency band that is becoming increasingly crowded with competing technologies is the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical band, encompassing, for example, Bluetooth and ZigBee, two low-power communication standards which are the base of several real-time protocols. Although these technologies employ mechanisms to improve their coexistence, they are still vulnerable to transmissions from uncoordinated stations with similar technologies or to higher power technologies such as Wi- Fi, which hinders the support of wireless dependable real-time communications in open environments. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the most commonly used wireless low-power technologies operating in the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and real-time protocols built upon them. The survey of the real-time protocols using these technologies is focused on factory automation applications, due to their more demanding timeliness and reliability requirements.",

Create a visual mobile end user development framework, named Puzzle, which allows end users without IT background to create, modify and execute applications, and provides support for interaction with smart things, phone functions and web services.
Methods
Design of an intuitive visual metaphor and associated interaction techniques for supporting end user development in mobile devices with iterative empirical validation.
Results

Conclusion
Puzzle has addressed the main objective. The framework further contributes to the research on mobile end user development in order to create an incentive for users to go beyond consuming content and applications to start creating their own applications.
Practice
Usage of a mobile end user development environment has the potential to create a shift from the conventional few-to-many distribution model of software to a many-to-many distribution model. Users will be able to create applications that fit their requirements and share their achievements with peers.

This article is composed as an early analysis of the air quality sensing project as a framework for the larger smart city story of Christchurch. It provides an overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the implementation of new technologies in a post-disaster environment. We examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, with focus on the terminology used by citizens, academicians, government and corporations. We then argue that top-down technocratic solutions to urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather, they can result in misaligned expectations or outcomes for stakeholders at the government and citizen level. We conclude by suggesting that citizen-led initiatives may be a way to promote more nuanced and inclusive ways of addressing local urban problems in a smart cities context.",

abstract = "Objective
Prosthetic grafts used for lower extremity revascularization and dialysis access fail because of hyperplastic stenosis and thrombosis. Graft surveillance is advocated to monitor function; however, graft failure can occur between episodic examinations. An innovative sensor with wireless, microchip technology allows automated surveillance with assessment of graft function using a “cloud”-based algorithm. We performed proof-of-concept experiments with in vitro and in vivo models to assess the feasibility such a real-time graft surveillance system.
Methods
A self-monitoring graft system was evaluated consisting of a prosthetic conduit of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and a sensor unit, and a microsensor, microelectronics, battery, and remote processor with a monitor. The sensor unit was integrated on the extraluminal surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts without compromise to the lumen of the conduit. The grafts were tested in vitro in a pulsatile, recirculating flow system under physiologic flow parameters. The hemodynamic parameters were varied to assess the ability to obtain wireless signal acquisition reflecting real-time flow properties in vitro. Segments of custom tubing with reduced diameters were inserted into the model to mimic stenosis proximal and distal to the grafts. After characterization of the initial data, the self-monitoring grafts were implanted in an ovine carotid model to assess proof of concept in vivo with 30-day follow-up of signal acquisition as well as arteriographic and histologic analysis.
Results
In vitro flow data demonstrated the device was able to determine factors related to prosthetic graft function under varied hemodynamic flow conditions. Wireless signal acquisition using Bluetooth technology (Bluetooth SIG, Inc, Kirkland, Wash) allowed remote data analysis reflecting graft flow parameters through changes in microsensor voltage and frequency. Waveform analysis was applied to construct an algorithm using proprietary software and determine a parameter for graft flow characteristics. This algorithm allowed determination of the degree of stenosis and location of stenosis location (proximal or distal) for display on a remote monitor in real time. Subsequent in vivo experiments confirmed the ability of the system to generate signal acquisition through skin and soft tissue under biologic conditions with no arteriographic stenosis and a favorable healing response at 30-day harvest.
Conclusions
Initial in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the ability for a self-monitoring graft system to remotely monitor hemodynamic parameters reflecting graft function using wireless data transmission. This automated system shows promise to deliver real-time data that can be analyzed by cloud-based algorithms alerting the clinician of a change in graft function or development of stenosis for further diagnostic study or intervention before graft failure.",

PIaaS offers more elegant parking information from cloud infrastructure to vehicular nodes in a security and privacy-conscious manner. The authentic vehicular nodes (verified by the Traffic Management Bureau (TMB)) along with Parking Side Units (PSUs) communicate their frequent parking information termed as Parking Mobility Vectors (PMVs) with the cloud infrastructure through the Road Side Units (RSUs) named as Communication Terminals (CTs). The CTs forward the inelegant parking information (PMVs) from vehicular nodes to the cloud system, while after processed by the cloud infrastructure in coordination with PSUs construct and transmit more elegant parking information towards the respective physical location of the vehicular nodes. All the communication and exchange of parking information between cloud infrastructure and vehicular nodes is handled in a privacy-conscious anonymous way. It is hard to linkage PMVs to certain vehicular nodes for some kind of information leakage or exploitation. The proposed PIaaS scheme using identity-less PMVs that protects movement profiles of the vehicular nodes from the exploitation of both insider and outsider attacks. Moreover, we proposed a novel geo-location-based parking lock encryption mechanism for location privacy and non-frameability. The cooperation among vehicular nodes, PSUs, and the cloud infrastructure is not only limited to the parking information dissemination but it also provides various kind of useful services such as route-based traffic congestion reports, vehicle theft control, and malicious vehicle detection. The cloud-oriented centralized information storage of the PMVs is very much helpful for analysis and forensics by TMB. In a nutshell, cloud infrastructure process the Big Parking Data (BPD) and yields the most significant parking information in a dynamic, pertinent, privacy and confidentiality preserved manner.",

abstract = "Computing devices permeate working and living environments, affecting all aspects of modern everyday lives; a trend which is expected to intensify in the coming years. In the residential setting, the enhanced features and services provided by said computing devices constitute what is typically referred to as a “smart home”. However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues. This paper presents XSACd, a cross-domain resource sharing & access control framework for smart environments, combining the well-studied fine-grained access control provided by the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). Based on standardized technologies, it enables seamless interactions and fine-grained policy-based management of heterogeneous smart devices, including support for communication between distributed networks, via the associated MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT)–based proxies. The framework is implemented in full, and its performance is evaluated on a test bed featuring relatively resource-constrained smart platforms and embedded devices, verifying the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

abstract = "Background
Research infrastructures (RIs) are essential to advance research on the relationship between food, nutrition, and health. RIs will facilitate innovation and allow insights at the systems level which are required to design (public health) strategies that will address societal challenges more effectively.
Approach
In the EuroDISH project we mapped existing RIs in the food and health area in Europe, identified outstanding needs, and synthesised this into a conceptual design of a pan-European DISH-RI. The DISH model was used to describe and structure the research area: Determinants of food choice, Intake of foods and nutrients, Status and functional markers of nutritional health, and Health and disease risk.
Key findings
The need to develop RIs in the food and health domain clearly emerged from the EuroDISH project. It showed the necessity for a unique interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder RI that overarches the research domains. A DISH-RI should bring services to the research community that facilitate network and community building and provide access to standardised, interoperable, and innovative data and tools. It should fulfil the scientific needs to connect within and between research domains and make use of current initiatives. Added value can also be created by providing services to policy makers and industry, unlocking data and enabling valorisation of research insights in practice through public-private partnerships. The governance of these services (e.g. ownership) and the centralised and distributed activities of the RI itself (e.g. flexibility, innovation) needs to be organised and aligned with the different interests of public and private partners.",

This interface performs two main functions: location of the workpiece in the Euclidean space and preservation of the workpiece position against any loads. Despite the critical nature of the part-machine interface, limited attention has been given to work holding systems in the academic community. In this respect, the main objective of this paper is to systematically review the field of fixture design, thus allowing the classification of fixturing systems to identify research trends and niches. This review is broken into four sections: (i) basics of fixturing and work holding; (ii) fixtures for single components. The classification of these systems is based on an evolutionary trend that allows to see how the development of technologies, such as additive manufacture, sensing technologies and actuation systems, affects fixture design; (iii) fixtures for multi-parts (both for batch production and assembly operations), with an emphasis on the unique challenges that arise from the assembling process; and (iv) conclusions, denoting various research trends/opportunities in the areas of fixture design and fixture instrumentation. Examples of these prospects includes the integration of fixtures with sensing technology (incentivise by the growth of industry 4.0) and the construction of truly new multi-part fixturing systems, rather than just the expansion of single component fixtures.",

This paper considers a benefit model for on-line preemptive multiprocessor scheduling. The goal is to maximize the total benefit gained by the jobs that meet their deadlines. This method prioritizes the jobs using their benefit density functions and schedules them in a real-time basis. We propose an online choice of two approximation algorithms in order to partition the jobs among identical processors at the time of their arrival without using any statistics. Our analysis and experiments show that we are able to maximize the gained benefit and decrease the computational complexity (compared to existing algorithms) while minimizing makespan (response time, also referred to as cost), with fewer missed deadlines and more balanced usage of processors. Our solution is applicable to a wide variety of soft real-time applications and embedded systems such as, but not limited to multimedia applications, medical monitoring systems or those with higher utilization such as bursty hosting servers.11This research is done by Behnaz Sanati and supervised by Professor Albert Cheng.",

DMP-IOT includes a recovery mechanism that avoids disconnection of the mobile sensor node(s) to the network in case of a false prediction. The simulation results show about 25% improvement of DMP-IOT in saving power consumption and reducing handoff delay and packet loss, compared to movement direction approaches in similar works. The accuracy of the proposed movement prediction scheme is 83%, in average, which is validated by t−Student statistical test.

The proposed architecture is tested on synthetic data generated for two million users. The system provided 94% accuracy for the classification and around 81% of the resource utilization on Amazon EC2 cloud. The key point of the paper is the use of SNA graphs to calculate role of an infected user in spreading the outbreak known as Outbreak Role Index (ORI).

abstract = "The topic of digital manufacturing is increasingly emerging in industry. One of the main scope of data digitalization is achieving more efficient factories. Different techniques and tools under the Industry 4.0 paradigm were already discussed in literature. These are aimed mostly at boosting company efficiency in terms of costs and environmental footprint. However, from a sustainability point of view, the social theme must be equally considered. While energy flows or costs can be already monitored in a production plant, this is not valid for data related to human effort. Monitoring systems aimed at supervising factory social sustainability were not already discussed in literature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to acquire social related data in a production plant. The method is supported by a smart architecture within the concept of IoT factory. Such architecture permits to monitor the parameters that could influence social sustainability in a production site. After a discussion on production plants facilities and features, the parameters that need to be considered to guarantee socially sustainable manufacturing processes are identified. A set of sensors controls these data taken from different sources, including operator vital signs. Operations as well as humans are monitored. Data acquired by sensors are collected by a central server. A decision maker can interpret the data and improve the production system from a social point of view, implementing corrective actions. Data can be exploited not only for social assessments but even for other analyses on the production system. Guaranteeing social sustainability could boost the factory productivity.

In particular, with the emerging theory of “Industry 4.0”, the integration of cloud technologies and industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) becomes increasingly important, as this will greatly improve the manufacturing chain and business services. In this paper, we first describe the development and character of ICPS. ICPS will inevitably play an important role in manufacturing, sales, and logistics. With the support of the cloud, ICPS development will impact value creation, business models, downstream services, and work organization. Then, we present a service-oriented ICPS model. With the support of the cloud, infrastructure platform and service application, ICPS will promote the manufacturing efficiency, increase quality of production, enable a sustainable industrial system and more environmentally friendly businesses. Thirdly, we focus on some key enabling technologies, which are critical in supporting smart factories. These key enabling technologies will also help companies to realize high quality, high output, and low cost. Finally, we talk about some challenges of ICPS implementation and the future work.",

Timely loss-of-contact detection between devices in pervasive systems using mobile networks is an important aspect for both functionality and user experience. Traditional schemes where time-to-live is defined by the service provider are not adequate in mobile networks where communication failures are frequent. On the other hand, schemes using keep-alive messaging tend to increase the communication overhead, in particular if the time to detect a loss of contact needs to be short. We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application. Our solution was evaluated with usage data from a professional application built on the PalCom framework. The measurements show a 96 % decrease of the communication overhead while still maintaining the same system responsiveness.",

Accurate sensor orientation in 3D space were estimated using a computationally efficient gradient decent algorithm and were utilized to calculate joint angles, which were temporally aligned using curve registration to facilitate inter-participant comparisons. An Analysis of Characterizing Phases was applied to the whole joint angle curve and showed a statistically significant difference in knee joint flexion-extension landing strategy between a participant with low back pain and nine uninjured participants.

MS plating of copper down THV and BV interconnects was shown to produce measurable benefits such as increased connectivity throughout a PCB and cost savings. More specifically, a 700% increase of copper plating rate was demonstrated for THVs of 175 µm diameter and depth-to-width aspect ratio (ar) of 5.7:1, compared with electrodeposition under no-agitation conditions. For BVs, a 60% average increase in copper thickness deposition in 150 µm and 200 µm, ar 1:1, was demonstrated against plating under standard manufacturing conditions including bubble agitation and panel movement. Finite element modelling simulations of acoustic scattering revealed 1st harmonic influence for plating rate enhancement.",

However, huge amount of information is the main characteristic of multi-camera system, and we have truly been in big data era for image/video processing. In the development of modern smart city, how to make accurate image retrieval in multi-camera system should be considered seriously. In previous researches, many approaches have been put forward. To the best of our knowledge, there is few research focusing on the method based on distributed fault-tolerant processing (DFP) method. The introduction of DFP will greatly improve the processing rate based on cloud computing, so it will be beneficial to the improvement of this issue. In this paper, we propose a distributed image-retrieval method designed for cloud-computing based multi-camera system in smart city. Through the combination of the cloud storage technology, data encryption and data retrieval technology, we achieve efficient integration and management of multi-camera resources. In this way, the cloud computing network data will be released more quickly, which can provide convenient storage service for users. What is more, experimental results show the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed method, compared with previous processing methods.",

To analyze this new model based control algorithm, a three zone heater barrel apparatus was designed and constructed for closed-loop testing to be performed. The experiments demonstrated the benefit of thermal camera feedback through the alterations in the control scheme. The availability of thermal profile of the system in comparison to single point temperature measurements resulted in the enhanced controller achieving better closed-loop transient responses, reduction in settling times. In addition, the use of spatial thermal images provides the possibility of controlling profiled temperature setpoints, showing the benefit and potential of using more advanced sensors in industry.",

On the contrary, demand is now driving the market to the extent that it will not be easy for mobile operating companies to cope up with the demand to come in the near future. Operators are forced to make heavy investments to upgrade and expand their networks, which then squeezes profits, as the evolution of income is not parallel to that of demand. On the other hand, the operators simply cannot refuse to take up the challenge. To decide how to handle the present and upcoming demand, they need to identify and understand the characteristics of the scenarios they face and will be facing. This is precisely the aim of this article, which provides figures on the consequences for mobile infrastructures of a generalised mobile data services uptake. To achieve this, the article collects information about the predicted evolution of different mobile services in the current and coming years and translates those expectations into service requirements. The paper closes with a discussion on the feasibility and the techno-economic implications for practical deployment, imposed by these requisites. Data from the Spanish mobile deployment case have been used to arrive at practical figures and illustration of results, but the conclusions are easily extended to other countries and regions.",

With Google's “Project Ara”, a modular and customizable smartphone approach is very likely to reach market maturity and its economic, social and ecologic impacts are still unclear. Using a qualitative case study approach, we shed light on its potential economic success. Furthermore, we use the two theoretical concepts of Eco Innovation (EI) and Systemic Innovation (SI) to assess Google Ara's potential to lead to changes in terms of ecologic and social concerns. In our analysis, we show that Project Ara has the potential to outperform its competitors of modular smartphones. We work out that Google's modular approach could lead to a longer useful life of smartphones – or at least for some components. Finally, we affirm Project Ara's general potential for being an SI. Even though Project Ara will very likely not change the complete smartphone market and the behavior of the involved actors, there is a potential for influencing sociocultural behavior in the long tail of the smartphone market.",

abstract = "It is believed that anomalous mental states such as stress and anxiety not only cause suffering for the individuals, but also lead to tragedies in some extreme cases. The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical way to predict an individual’s mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals’ mental states.",

We also address the unmet needs and challenges of xPOCT. Finally, we critically summarize the in-field applicability and the future perspectives of the presented approaches.",

Firstly, the data captured by smartphone sensors is categorized into groups by deep stacked autoencoders (SAE), which is a traditional deep learning architecture with multi-layer sparse autoencoders for feature extraction and a softmax layer for classification. For instance, accelerometer data from smartphones can be classified in accordance with different user motion states such as sitting, standing, walking, and running. Secondly, the quantitative correlation between divided sensor data and individual health is built. For example, walking and running for a suitable amount of time are beneficial to human health. Finally, a simulation experiment is devised to verify the performance of the proposed method. A 0.15 percent gain on the overall classification accuracy for automatic feature extraction on the human action recognition (HAR) dataset has been achieved compared with the state of the art methods and 0.5 percent gain for manual feature extraction. It is also demonstrated by the experimental results that smartphone sensor data can reveal the health status of the user to some degree and smartphone can serve as an assistant for human health.",

However, detecting stress in real life with an unobtrusive wrist device is a challenging task.

First, we explore the problem of stress detection using machine learning and signal processing techniques in laboratory conditions, and then we apply the extracted laboratory knowledge to real-life data. We propose a novel context-based stress-detection method. The method consists of three machine-learning components: a laboratory stress detector that is trained on laboratory data and detects short-term stress every 2min; an activity recognizer that continuously recognizes the user’s activity and thus provides context information; and a context-based stress detector that uses the outputs of the laboratory stress detector, activity recognizer and other contexts, in order to provide the final decision on 20-min intervals. Experiments on 55days of real-life data showed that the method detects (recalls) 70% of the stress events with a precision of 95%.",

In this paper, we develop social theory that aims to provide a better understanding of the prominent role of phatic technologies in society. We proceed in three stages: first, we critique and revise Giddens’ vague concept of symbolic tokens and its implications for time space distanciation by introducing novel concepts from measurement science. This focuses on forms of information that are relatively precise and communal. Secondly, building on our new formulation of abstract systems, we propose new sociological concepts, phatic systems and symbolic indicators, to enable social theory to explore and analyse the rise of phatic technologies. The concepts focus on the personal and emotional. Thirdly, reflecting on the fact that our digital society is held together by software, we introduce concepts from theoretical computer science to relate the abstract sociological idea of phatic systems and symbolic indicators to the concrete nature of digital data.",

One of the biggest security problems for any system lies in software bugs. If software does something we don't expect, then that can create security issues that could have far-reaching ramifications. Traditionally, we have detected bugs using empirical evidence, by looking at software's behaviour to see if it does anything out of the ordinary. In many cases, of course, we only find out about the errors once the software is being used in the field. Danny Bradbury explores whether there are better ways of going about producing clean, safe software.",

abstract = "Cardiovascular disease has become an increasingly serious threat to human health. Holter monitoring is essential in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. When combined with a variety of sensors, a traditional Holter becomes a mobile health device. Based on Holter data and sensor data, this paper proposes a supplementary diagnosis and treatment program. The solution consists of three main steps: I. Perform segmentation of ECG (Electrocardiography) data and conduct feature extraction. Build the personalized ECG templates, apply factor graph and max-sum algorithm for precise template matching, and realize the feature extraction and representation of ECG data. II. Use the action sensor data for action classification and identification. As an important factor of health monitoring, body movements are categorized as resting, walking, going upstairs and downstairs, flipping and sudden change. The improved classification algorithm achieves high accuracy identification. III. Combine ECG data and action data for clustering analysis. The proposed solution improves the affinity propagation algorithm and allow doctors to supervise the clustering procedure. A knowledge matrix is introduced accordingly, thus achieving an iterable clustering optimization. With the help of these components, the innovative approach is able to integrate the Holter data and sensor data, meanwhile, doctors are encouraged to participate in the process of clustering algorithm. Our system is capable of not only assisting doctors in quickly determining the most valuable information, but also of building a personalized private repository for patients. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is an efficient, accurate, and interactive auxiliary diagnostic and a therapeutic support tool.",

abstract = "Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect’s face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer’s uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.",

Authors selected RFID technology as one of possible ways to eliminate discussed problems. Implementation of a new technology and RFID specifically, is problematic, because it disrupts status quo. Even if implementation is local, its effects are global and affect whole organization or even network of organizations. Organization should assess the scale of changes before making decision on implementation. An assessment and rationale for RFID implementation is difficult, so companies are aware. They are sometimes mandated by partners or governments, but always must rely on consultants. RFID is a technology that leads to automation of processes and limitation of simple human task. Authors proposed expert-analytic approach to challenge described issues. The approach was applied in several European manufacturing companies. It was confirmed that the scale of technology impact is exceeding pure area of RFID implementation. The approach is quick and constitutes a rationale of RFID implementation. The approach called ART (Assessment of RFID Technology) was positively verified. Results are satisfactory for rough comparison of pros and cons of RFID implemented in supply chain. Basing on achieved results, decision about further detailed analysis and design of RFID system, which is usually costly and time-consuming, could be made. The approach generates signposts for companies, if RFID should be considered. Assumptions of the approach are general and could be easily adjusted for other technologies. It is especially important when discussing technologies that are hardly comparable to other or reported case studies are very different, so company cannot rely on experiences of other organizations or fields of application. It is also a use case for evolved approach, when the scale of an impact of technology implementation is wide and not narrowed to the area of its physical implementation.",

abstract = "Over the past several years, the development of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has blossomed owing to many advantages such as the simple structure, high conversion efficiency and wide material selectivity. Currently, most of TENG devices are constructed with micro-structured surfaces using complicated manufacturing processes. Owing to the lack of high-volume manufacturing scalability, it still remains a bottleneck to apply TENG into the commercial products. In this work, we report the development of a novel TENG, which leverages on the regenerated, flexible, biocompatible, and highly transparent silk-fibroin as a triboelectric layer and can be deposited on a PET/ITO substrate (SF/PET/ITO) using a simple spray-coating process. The as-fabricated TENG exhibits a maximum voltage of 213.9V and a high power density of 68.0mW/m2 as a result of the ability of losing electrons and rough surface rendered by the silk-fibroin. We further demonstrate that this generator can charge a capacitor (10μF) to 4.5V in 6mins, and instantaneously light up as many as 100 commercial LED bulbs. We anticipate that the large-scale fabrication of silk-fibroin-based TENGs will serve as a promising system for electricity generation with an extremely low cost to commercial applications.",

To achieve this, recent research has shown how biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) or electrocardiograms (ECGs), can be useful for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a new CA scheme that, contrarily to previous works in this area, considers ECG signals as continuous data streams. The data stream paradigm is suitable for this scenario since algorithms tailored for data streams can cope with continuous data of a theoretical infinite length and with a certain variability. The proposed ECG-based CA system is intended for real-time applications and is able to offer an accuracy up to 96%, with an almost perfect system performance (kappa statistic >80%).",

This encompasses not just life at home but in particular the mobility of elderly people (e.g. when going for a walk or having sports) as well. Within this paper we will introduce a novel architecture for distributed AAL solutions whose design follows a modern Microservices approach by providing small core services instead of a monolithic application framework. The architecture comprises core services for sensor integration, and service discovery while supporting several communication models (periodic, sporadic, streaming). We extend the state-of-the-art by introducing a fault-tolerance model for our architecture on the basis of a fault-hypothesis describing the fault-containment regions (FCRs) with their respective failure modes and failure rates in order to support safety-critical AAL applications.",

Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems—these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans. Ultimately, we are far from achieving artificial consciousness.",

abstract = "Service is a key context for the application of IT, as IT digitizes information interactions in service and facilitates value creation, thereby contributing to service innovation. The recent proliferation of big data provides numerous opportunities for information-intensive services (IISs), in which information interactions exert the greatest effect on value creation. In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in IISs is essential for using IT to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new IISs and by analyzing data usage in 149 IIS cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs. The main contribution of this study is to provide a simple yet comprehensive and empirically tested basis for the use and management of data to facilitate service value creation.",

A nanocomposite of ZnO nanorods, exfoliated graphene oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes are dispersed in PDMS resin. Dynamic contact mode electrostatic force microscopy is performed to analyse the ferroelectric and piezoelectric property of the prepared hybrid nanocomposite. Using the above nanocomposite, a device is fabricated which works on combined effect of piezoelectric and triboelectric characteristic of materials under study. Qualitative studies are performed on this using force sensitive resistor. The device generated a maximum voltage of 7.5V in the case of higher pressure (analog reading > 800). Quantitative studies are conducted using a universal vibration apparatus at various revolutions per minute and maximum of 15.25V is obtained. Hybrid nanocomposite device is scaled up in dimension and is tested under irregular finger assisted tapping, press-release operation and human footsteps yielding an output voltage of 36V, 40V and 50V respectively. The obtained alternating voltages are rectified and stored into a commercial capacitor. Enhancing the current characteristics of the piezo-tribo device will prove to be an excellent substitute for energy harvesting and self-powering applications.",

The smart in-car camera can detect objects in recorded videos during driving, and can decide which part of videos needs to be stored in cloud platforms to save local storage space. The system puts the training process and model repository in cloud platforms, and the recognition process and data gathering in mobile devices. The mobile side is implemented in NVIDIA Jetson TK1, and the communication is carried out via Git protocol to ensure the success of data transmission in unstable network environments. Experimental results show that detection rate can achieve up to four frame-per-second with Faster R-CNN, and the system can work well even when the network connection is unstable. We also compared the performance of system with and without GPU, and found that GPU still plays a critical role in the recognition side for deep learning.",

abstract = "Purpose: Ultrasound scanning has been widely used for preliminary diagnosis as it is non-invasive and has good scope for the doctors to analyze many diseases. Due to lack of trained radiologists in remote areas, tele-radiology is used to diagnose the scanned ultrasound data. Availability of online radiographers and having communication facility for the portable ultrasound are issues in tele-radiology for using ultrasound scanning in remote health-care. In these situations, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) will be beneficial in diagnosing the patients with minimal manual intervention. Methods: We proposed FPGA based CAD algorithm for abnormality detection of kidney in ultrasound images. The proposed algorithm works in the following way: as a pre-processing, an ultrasound image is denoised and region of interest of kidney in ultrasound image is segmented. Intensity histogram features and Haralick features are extracted from the segmented kidney region. Based on extracted features, the classification algorithm is implemented in two stages. In first stage, a Look Up Table (LUT) based approach is used to differentiate between normal and abnormal kidney images. In second stage, after confirming the abnormality, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with extracted features is used to further classify the presence of stone or cyst in kidney. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a FPGA based Xilinx Kintex-7 board. Results: The proposed algorithm gave an accuracy of 98.14%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.82% in detecting the exact abnormality present in kidney ultrasound images. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and its hardware implementation will be beneficial for diagnosing the kidney in absence of radiologists and internet connectivity.",

An important element of such a smart grid is prosumers i.e. the consumers who also produce and share surplus energy with grid and other users. Prosumers are not only an important stakeholder of the future smart grids but also have a vital role in peak demand management. Therefore, it is needed to investigate and review the Prosumers based Energy Management and Sharing (PEMS) along with associated challenges. It will help in understanding and analyzing the impact of prosumers in future smart grids. In order to achieve these objectives, this paper presents a comprehensive review of PEMS in smart grid environment and associated impact on power system reliability and energy sustainability. The process of energy sharing among prosumers involves two key elements: information and communication technologies and optimization techniques. These two elements have been discussed in detail to cover the PEMS implementation requirements. The relevant communications technologies presented in the paper include wired, wireless, short and long range options while linear and nonlinear optimization techniques, in context of PEMS, are described. Various technologies, methodologies and mechanisms adopted for PEMS are comprehensively discussed in order to enhance readers’ intuition. Challenges and issues faced by prosumer communities and energy sharing have also been elaborated in detail.",

The proposed method detects the entire QRS complex and removes the noise between two QRS complexes, while recovering P and T-waves. As verified in the tests on simulated noisy ECG signals, QRSMR outputs with seriously contaminated ECG signals have an increase of the correlation with their original clean signals from 40% to nearly 80%, demonstrating the improved noise removal ability of QRSMR. Moreover, in the tests on real ECG signals measured on volunteers with a flexible wearable ECG monitoring device developed at Fudan University, QRSMR is able to recover P-wave and T-wave from the contaminated signal, which shows its enhanced performance on motion artifact reduction comparing with adaptive filtering method and other methods based only on empirical mode decomposition.",

However, the degree of their practical implementation has to be scrutinized. To define a status quo, it is important to analyze the situation and to identify deficits, starting points and unexploited potentials. Still, a detailed understanding of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation is lacking especially in small and medium sized manufacturing companies. In addition, the fourth industrial revolution is associated by most companies only with logistics as well as production and manufacturing areas. The opportunities to integrate additional functional areas of the production process and the vertical value chain into the concept of the fourth industrial revolution are hardly considered. Starting from the point of view that the fourth industrial revolution is defined as a systematic increase in the flexibility of products and processes through automation, extensive networking and decentralized control mechanisms, as well as a data acquisition and integration through information and communication technologies, a study concept is developed. For this purpose, it is not enough to ask only for the present prevalence of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. It is necessary to analyze the processes within manufacturing companies. A survey concept is developed that initially breaks down the vertical value chain as well as the production process into specific sub-processes. These sub-processes are analyzed regarding their degree of automation and digitalization and networking among themselves. The results of this survey presents concisely the call for action, the state of implementation and realized solutions of the fourth industrial revolution in Germany.

Indeed, new collaborative applications emerged from theses new supports using classical interaction &lpar;through keyboard, mouse and screen devices&rpar;. Nowadays, new sensory entries enable users using their hands to manipulate different objects. This article is indented to propose a global interaction model that associates multiagent system concepts to interactive table entities. The model proposes two types of entities that can be used simultaneously: virtual and tangible entities. The virtual entities can result from video projection or from screen use on the interactive table. The tangible entities are physical objects that can be manipulated by one or several users. These are detected through dedicated sensors. At the end of this article, a case study is presented. It illustrates the management of a road traffic simulator using the TangiSense interactive table. The illustrations show mainly the communication between the different agents. In addition, the simulator presents the advantages of the proposed model in order to facilitate the implied users’ decision during the simulation process.",

abstract = "The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an infrastructure comprised of sensing, computing, and communication devices, that obtain and process data to help understand the behavior of the monitored environment, and to react to events and phenomena that occur in it. The WSN can be used in domains such as agriculture, energy, industrial automation, medical health care, smart building, and so on. In industry, the characteristics of the wireless channel are different in comparison to other WSN environments, such as home and office environments. The use of WSN in industry is subject to typical problems of wireless communications, such as noise, shadowing, multipath fading and interference. In addition, the wireless channel in many industrial environments is non-stationary for a long term, which can cause abrupt changes in the characteristics of the channel over time. A set of standards was developed for industrial WSN, to overcome these limitations, such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, WIA-PA, and IEEE 802.15.4e. All the mentioned standards are based on the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer, but define different mechanisms for the upper layers. However, according to recent publications, problems still can arise in the deployment of networks that follow the standards, because of multipath effects, and interference. This survey provides a structured overview of the standards used to implement industrial WSN, their advantages and drawbacks, and discusses the characteristics of the wireless channel in industrial environments. Finally, a systematic mapping is described, that presents results of publications about industrial WSN, and highlights important topics to be studied in this field.",

abstract = "Many older patients and patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) do not respect medication prescriptions. Non-adherence is caused by several factors among which three play an important role: Treatment complexity, cognitive decline, and patient-provider communication. This article presents an ongoing multidisciplinary project, the CONSIGNELA project, which adopts a patient-centered approach for improving medication adherence in these patients. The first objective of the project is to identify the best way to communicate medication prescriptions with tablets and touch-screen devices. The second objective is to improve medication adherence by creating a collaborative application (app) designed both for older and PD patients and for healthcare professionals in charge of them. Two solutions are combined: A cognitive and a technological solutions. The cognitive solution consists in studying in real time older and PD patients while consulting and executing prescriptions presented in different formats to select the most efficient one. The technological solution aims to improve collaboration between health professionals and patients by developing System of Systems (SoS). The research model used in the project includes three phases. Only the results of phase 1 are presented in the article. A research app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-R was programmed to analyze patient cognitive processes while consulting a prescription on a tablet. A pilot study was carried out with young adults to test it. It confirmed a facilitating effect of table format. In parallel, the prototype of a second app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-P, for patients and healthcare providers was developed. It is based on an SoS architecture connecting a virtual pillbox, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and a knowledge platform. The virtual pillbox is used by patients and providers to improve mutual understanding of medication prescriptions. The MAS provides agents that extract and analyze indicators, actions and information resulting from the interaction between patients and virtual pillboxes. All the information is capitalized and stored in the knowledge platform. Providers can receive charts and dashboards showing information about the following of the medication regimen, for instance, if patients are following it correctly or not.",

abstract = "In new product development processes the ramp-up phase is the most critical. For the first time the new product will be produced under standard production conditions. Thereby companies are facing enormous challenges relating to new products: increasing product and process complexities, less time-to-market and highest quality requirements. In addition to this, shorter product lifecycles cause frequent ramp-ups. Companies must develop skills to conquer these challenges especially in terms of developing professional ramp-up expertise. The transfer from prototype to scalable product causes many different unpredictable failures. Those failures require a strong failure management to guarantee the planned time-to-market. Key element in effective failure management is communication in this high interdisciplinary process. Today failure management in most companies is realized in task force mode. There is no system support from right failure notice, right failure classification and failure allocation to the right person to the point of effective support finding a solution as well as failure solution documentation. In addition to that there is no transparency about work in progress and allocated failures. The outcome of this is loss of time and inadequately documentation of failures which again causes loss of time. Hence the focus of this paper is on a CPS-tool realizing holistic failure management within the human acts as human sensor to solve those challenges. Objective at this juncture is the development of intelligent connection between responsibilities (ad-hoc organizations) in ramp-up and workflow strategies to reach efficient management applying tablet computer. Focused strategies are effort reducing, highest transparency and escalation scenarios.",

We have adapted the data flow in CBM classical architecture in order to consider the resultant information from maintenance operations associated with the technical teams and their contexts. For this purpose was used a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) approach to consider human and context factors. Considering the CPS as system that combines and coordinates physical and computational elements, the CPS incorporates the ability to act in the physical world with the intelligence from cyber or virtual world. In this paper, we propose to use a CPS for taking account human/context factors applied maintenance strategies. The proposed tool, called Toogle-IMS, aims at developing an advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applied to Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS).

Then, we introduce a sensitivity analysis method dedicated to the BCC receiver by means of a receiver gain and an output noise spectral density. To verify the sensitivity analysis method, we implemented a direct conversion BCC receiver in 0.18μm CMOS technology. By measuring the gain, output spectral density, and sensitivity of the receiver with respect to the various source impedance values, we found that the calculated value through the proposed analysis method agrees well with the theoretical value within 2.5dB difference.",

Then, the paper presents the main research issues related to CPS design and, in particular, the needs for an integrated and multi-scale designing approach to prevent conflicts across different design domains early enough within the CPS development process. To this aim, the impact of the extension from mechatronic to Cyber-Physical Systems on their design is examined through a set of existing related modelling techniques. The multi-scalability requirement of these techniques is firstly described, concerning external/internal interactions, process control, behaviour simulation, representation of topological relationships and interoperability through a multi-agent platform, and then applied to the case study of a tablets manufacturing process. Finally, the proposed holistic description of such a multi-scale manufacturing CPS allows to outline the main characteristics of a modelling-simulation platform, able notably to bridge the semantic gaps existing between the different designing disciplines and specialised domains.",

abstract = "Purpose
Mobile health or mHealth research has been growing exponentially in recent years. However, the research on mHealth has been ad-hoc and selective without a clear definition of the mHealth domain. Without a roadmap for research we may not realize the full potential of mHealth. In this paper, we present an ontological framework to define the mHealth domain and illuminate a roadmap.
Methods
We present an ontology of mHealth. The ontology is developed by systematically deconstructing the domain into its primary dimensions and elements. We map the extent research on mHealth in 2014 onto the ontology and highlight the bright, light, and blind/blank spots which represent the emphasis of mHealth research.
Findings
The emphases of mHealth research in 2014 are very uneven. There are a few bright spots and many light spots. The research predominantly focuses on individuals’ use of mobile devices and applications to capture or obtain health-related data mostly to improve quality of care through mobile intervention.
Conclusions
We argue that the emphases can be balanced in the roadmap for mHealth research. The ontological mapping plays an integral role in developing and maintaining the roadmap which can be updated periodically to continuously assess and guide mHealth research.",

In this work, we have proposed a new background subtraction method using Fisher’s linear discriminant ratio based threshold. This threshold is investigated automatically during run-time for each pixel of every sequential frame. Automatically means to avoid the involvement of external source such as programmer or user for threshold selection. This threshold provides better pixel classification at run-time. This method handles problems generated due to multiple behavior of background more accurately using Fisher’s ratio. It maximizes the separation between object pixel and the background pixel. To check the efficacy, the performance of this work is observed in terms of various parameters depicted in analysis.

In this paper, we attempt to explain the expanding body of the work in this area, including a discussion of recent techniques and algorithms. With the present work, we also enhance the reliability, accuracy, and speed of 3D SEM surface reconstruction by designing and developing an optimized multi-view framework. We then consider several real-world experiments as well as synthetic data to examine the qualitative and quantitative attributes of our proposed framework.

This paper proposes a futures-based, iterative policy-informed design framework for developing wearable devices that guides interdisciplinary collaborators early in the process of designing a research & development plan.

Standard printed circuit board (PCB)-based devices are obtrusive and rigid and hence not suitable for textile based implementations. An attractive option would be direct printing of circuit layout on the textile itself, negating the use of rigid PCB materials. However, high surface roughness and porosity of textiles prevents efficient and reliable printing of electronics on textile. In this work, by printing an interface layer on the textile first, a complete localization circuit integrated with an antenna has been inkjet-printed on the textile for the first time. Printed conductive traces were optimized in terms of conductivity and resolution by controlling the number of over-printed layers. The tracking device determines the wearer's position using WiFi and this information can be displayed on any internet-enabled device, such as smart phone. The device is compact (55mm×45mm) and lightweight (22g with 500mAh battery) for people to comfortably wear it and can be easily concealed in case discretion is required.

Current delayed analysis processing in adaptive language learning systems is difficult to cope with the high-speed and high-volume data streams. To overcome this problem, we introduce a complex event processing (CEP) framework for an Adaptive Language Learning System. The system consists of an event adapter sub-system that can process various inputs such as voice, video, text and other interaction events. The event adapter extracts relevant data to support the operational events module, the learning activity events module and the learner knowledge space events module. These three modules in the event hierarchies provide support to the learner adaptation and learner visual analytics modules. In this study, we conduct three simulations to evaluate the initialization time, delay time and throughput of the proposed system. Each of the experiments simulates 1000 learners and 1000 rules and generates 10 events per second. The results indicate the CEP framework is efficient with a processing delay of less than 1.2μs and throughput of 80,000 events per second. We conclude by discussing the study’s implications and suggest ideas for future research.",

Different e-health strategies may produce different long-term results, so it is of general interest to look into strategies behind e-health approaches, and what factors that influence strategy-formation.
Problem statement
Previous studies into process improvements in the e-health area has suggested that approaches and strategies are very dependent on national contexts. This study explores this issue, by sampling two national regions in Europe, the St. Gallen region and canton in Switzerland, and the Agder region comprised of the two Agder-counties, in Norway. The research questions revolve around the extent to which the context influences e-health innovation in two different European regions.
Approach
To throw light on the area of concern, the author performed a cross-sectional case-study into publicly known e-health research and innovation projects or implementation projects in the two regions at comparable level of analysis; transparent (public) collaborative projects with more than one autonomous partner, at least one being from the regions research-institutions or governmental bodies.
Results
This study reports that there were some different regional convergences within the mentioned framework. In general there seems to be a gap concerning studies around the extension of clinical systems into homecare in St. Gallen, and a gap concerning more cross-sectional, holistic studies in Agder.
Conclusions
This article summarizes by pointing out themes for further research that needs more attention, both in general and within each of the two contexts, as a recommendation to the research community. These themes may also have implications for practice.",

We investigated whether pattern matching of QRS loops in the 3-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) will improve the grouping of patients whose space-time electrical activity akin to each other, thereby assisting in clinical decision making. First, pattern dissimilarity of VCG QRS loops is qualitatively measured and characterized among patients, resulting in a 93×93 distance matrix of patient-to-patient dissimilarity. Each patient is then represented as a node in the network (or a star in the galaxy), but node locations are optimized to preserve the dissimilarity matrix. The optimization is achieved with a self-organizing algorithm that iteratively minimizes the network energy. Experimental results showed that patients’ locations converge as the representation error reaches a stable phase. The convergence is independent of initial locations of network nodes. Most importantly, 93 patients are automatically organized into 3 clusters of healthy control, LBBB, and infarction. Spatial coordinates of nodes (or patients) are evidently novel predictors that can be used in the computer-assisted detection of cardiac disorders. Self-organizing pattern matching is shown to have strong potentials for large-scale unsupervised learning of patient groups.",

On the basis of this concept, this study modified the existing fuzzy weighted average (FWA) nonlinear programming (NLP) approach by incorporating a mechanism of predicting a patient’s unknown preferences for different nearby clinics to improve the performance of ubiquitous clinic recommendation. The proposed methodology was applied to a small region in Taiwan, and the experimental results confirmed its superiority over four existing methods in effectively improving the successful recommendation rates for patients in both training and testing groups. Comparing the results of the proposed methodology with those of the original FWA-NLP approach revealed that the proposed methodology has an advantage because of the mechanism of predicting patients’ unknown preferences.",

Yet many countries' NIPs have resulted in tremendous societal benefit through both planned and unplanned action not associated with these goals.

Yet the policies that govern Social Entrepreneurial Action (SEA) at these facilities are unclear. If there is not a place for SEA in these facilities for technology transfer practice then there is cause for concern. Here we add to the growing literature on SEA by utilizing the case study method to investigate how SEA has been utilized by the US National Innovation Systems (NIS) for the benefit of society. We do this by investigating two cases which emphasize internal (corporate) and external SEA in a research facility within the US NIS. We demonstrate how a US national laboratory's external engagement of SEA led to one of the most important innovations of the last half of the 20th century – the Laminar Flow Clean Room. We also show how internal SEA led to the emergence of the National Institute for Nanotechnology Engineering (NINE). The “NINE program” created a pathway enabling the emergence of nascent policy makers, technologists and entrepreneurial professionals. We then provide a model for SEA at US national laboratories through technology able social innovators and identify a new type of internal and external social entrepreneur – the Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE).",

We assume that sensors make independent local decisions about the existing hypothesis and report their decisions to a fusion center, where the final decision is made. Sensors are divided into groups with two sensors each, where sensors in each pair cooperate to send their decisions as a DSTC. Differential modulation scheme, which does not require knowledge of the instantaneous fading gains, is considered to avoid the channel estimation overhead at the cooperating sensors and the fusion center. Channels between sensors and the fusion center are assumed independent identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading channels. Moreover, Jakes-Clarkes’ channel model is considered to model the mobility of sensors and/or the fusion center. Since the complexity of the optimal fusion rule grows up exponentially with the observation interval, suboptimal fusion rules are derived and discussed. Finally, simulation results of the proposed cooperative scheme are provided and the detection capabilities of the derived decision fusion rules are compared.",

abstract = "This paper investigates the effective spatial coverage of nationwide land-based weather stations of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for traffic crash analysis. The weather data were collected from the Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data (QCLCD) and the fatal crashes were obtained from the Fatality Analysis Reporting Systems (FARS) during the year of 2007–2014. Both QCLCD and FARS contain geographic coordinates for locations and weather condition information as a categorical variable. The spatial coverage of weather stations for the analysis was made by geoprocessing, which uses multiple buffers (i.e. radii 5, 10, 15, and 20 miles), and then was evaluated via Cohen's κ statistics, which is used to determine an agreement of weather between QCLCD and FARS within the buffer. The applicability of the weather station's data by nine climate regions was assessed by developing a series of negative binomial models. According to the estimated Cohen's κ statistics, the rain and snow weather conditions have a moderate agreement up to 20 miles. However, in the case of fog weather condition, it has a slight agreement. The statistical modeling results showed that weather stations data can be a good exposure measure for weather-related fatal crashes along with the vehicle-miles-traveled. Considering one geographical feature that approximately more than 75% of all fatal crashes are located within 20-miles radius of the weather stations in the USA, it is evident that the data from the existing weather stations can be cost-effective to develop geospatial crash risk analysis model.",

abstract = "Under glycemic variability, a characterization of the desired blood glucose (BG) behavior is needed to assess if a given artificial pancreas (AP) respects its specification. The specification is an essential element to detect any deviation from an adequate insulin policy. Specializing the monitoring specification is therefore of utmost importance as existing guidelines for diabetes management are general and do not take into account how the personal factors and lifestyle affect the glycemic behavior. Surely, recommending personalized monitoring specifications may provide flexible and appropriate treatment goals to be attained by diabetic patients in order to account for their actual treatment needs. In this work, we use machine learning models to characterize glycemic behavior in synthetic healthy individuals. To account for the day-by-day fluctuation in BG levels, we use a stochastic process superimposed on a deterministic model of the glucose-insulin dynamics. The obtained characterization of the glycemic behavior in healthy individuals is then used as the target class to predict, and thus recommend, personalized monitoring specifications to diabetic patients. Results show that the approach stands as a feasible strategy to recommending appropriate and realistic monitoring goals for diabetic patients based on healthy individuals who share a similar glycemic behavior. Eventually, the incorporation of a recommender approach on an intelligent monitoring system for the AP will allow on-line adaptation of the treatment requirements for each patient.",

As far as product data are concerned, data exchange, 3D visualization, and communication are crucial processes for reusing manufacturing intelligence across lifecycle stages. Research and industry have developed several CAD interoperability, and visualization formats to uphold these product development strategies. Most of them, however, have not yet provided sufficient integration capabilities required for current digital transformation needs, mainly due to their lack of versatility in the multi-domains of the product lifecycle and primary focus on individual product descriptions.

However, implementation of the CP strategy was facing barriers, such as the lack of complete data and valuable knowledge that can be employed to provide better support on decision-making of coordination and optimization on the product lifecycle management (PLM) and the whole CP process. Fortunately, with the wide use of smart sensing devices in PLM, a large amount of real-time and multi-source lifecycle big data can now be collected. To make better PLM and CP decisions based on these data, in this paper, an overall architecture of big data-based analytics for product lifecycle (BDA-PL) was proposed. It integrated big data analytics and service-driven patterns that helped to overcome the above-mentioned barriers. Under the architecture, the availability and accessibility of data and knowledge related to the product were achieved. Focusing on manufacturing and maintenance process of the product lifecycle, and the key technologies were developed to implement the big data analytics. The presented architecture was demonstrated by an application scenario, and some observations and findings were discussed in details. The results showed that the proposed architecture benefited customers, manufacturers, environment and even all stages of PLM, and effectively promoted the implementation of CP. In addition, the managerial implications of the proposed architecture for four departments were analyzed and discussed. The new CP strategy provided a theoretical and practical basis for the sustainable development of manufacturing enterprises.",

Wearable technology (wearables) is one approach that offers a viable means for ubiquitous, sustainable and scalable monitoring of the health of older adults in habitual free-living environments. Gait has been presented as a relevant (bio)marker in ageing and pathological studies, with objective assessment achievable by inertial-based wearables. Commercial wearables have struggled to provide accurate analytics and have been limited by non-clinically oriented gait outcomes. Moreover, some research-grade wearables also fail to provide transparent functionality due to limitations in proprietary software. Innovation within this field is often sporadic, with large heterogeneity of wearable types and algorithms for gait outcomes leading to a lack of pragmatic use. This review provides a summary of the recent literature on gait assessment through the use of wearables, focusing on the need for an algorithm fusion approach to measurement, culminating in the ability to better detect and classify falls. A brief presentation of wearables in one pathological group is presented, identifying appropriate work for researchers in other cohorts to utilise. Suggestions for how this domain needs to progress are also summarised.",

The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing.",

A first order disruption is a localized change, within a market or industry. A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.",

However, recent advances in electronic healthcare systems allow transmission of sensitive information through the Internet, which is prone to various vulnerabilities, attacks and may leads to unauthorized disclosure. Such situations may not only create adverse effects for individuals but may also cause severe consequences such as hefty regulatory fines, bad publicity, legal fees, and forensics. To avoid such predicaments, a privacy protected healthcare system is proposed in this study that protects the identity of an individual as well as detects vocal fold disorders. The privacy of the developed healthcare system is based on the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm, which embeds a watermark in a secret key instead of the signals to avoid the distortion in an audio sample. The identity is protected by the generation of its secret shares through visual cryptography. The generated shares are embedded by finding the patterns into the audio with the application of one-dimensional local binary pattern. The proposed zero-watermarking algorithm is evaluated by using audio samples taken from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary voice disorder database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves imperceptibility and is reliable in its extraction of identity. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not affect the results of disorder detection and it is robust against noise attacks of various signal-to-noise ratios.",

Due to growth of big data over cloud, allocating appropriate cloud resources has emerged as a major research problem. The current methodologies allocate cloud resources based upon data characteristics. But due to random nature of data generation, the characteristics of data in big data streams are unknown. This poses difficulty in selecting and allocating appropriate resources to big data stream. Solving this problem, an efficient resource management system is proposed in this paper. The proposed system initially estimates the data characteristics of big data stream in terms of volume, velocity, variety and variability. The estimated values are expressed in terms of a vector called Characteristics of Data (CoD). On the other hand, clusters of cloud resources are created dynamically with the help of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). SOM uses CoD to create and allocate cluster to big data stream. Moreover, the topological ordering of clusters formed by SOM is used to reduce waiting time. The proposed system is tested experimentally. The experimental results show that the proposed system not only efficiently predicts data characteristics but also effectively enhanced the performance of cloud resources.",

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”. The indices derived from the proposed approach are capable of uncovering the relationships between the individual technological sectors and provide numerical metrics to measure the presence of converging technologies.",

While sitting on these vast pools of data, many organizations are simply not ready to take advantage of this new strategic resource. Embracing big data requires addressing a number of barriers that fall into the domains of technology, people, and organization. A holistic, socio-technical approach is required to overcome these barriers. This article introduces the specific tactics we recommend for addressing big data barriers, which involve changes to technology infrastructure, a focus on privacy, promotion of big data and analytic skills development, and the creation of a clear organizational vision related to big data.",

The recorder is based on a three-layer architecture including data acquisition, processing and communication modules. The design is not dedicated to a particular purpose, and thus any remote diagnosis based on variety of spontaneous physiological signals (e.g. ECG, EMG) may be performed. The configuration of all three layers is independently controlled by the software and thus allows for real-time reconfiguration of sensors, processing level and report content.",

Standardisation plays a key role in shaping the rules that govern these developments and their effects on society. Due to the large variety of actors involved in these trends, the associated standardisation processes are likely to involve all three modes of standardisation identified in the literature: committee-based, market-based and government-based. This multi-mode standardisation challenges the theoretical views on standardisation which predominantly focus on one of the modes. In this paper, we review the existing literatures on individual modes and on multi-mode standardisation. By recombining existing evidence, we generate new insights into multi-mode standardisation processes. These first insights relate to the contributions that each mode can make to such processes’ outcomes and suggest that their impact depends on factors, such as their initiation’s timing and the institutional context in which the standardisation process occurs. Moreover, we consider the conditions under which actors can launch each mode. Based on our observations, we formulate an agenda for future research to obtain a better understanding of multi-mode standardisation. We offer recommendations for industry actors, NGOs, researchers and policy makers involved in shaping technological and societal change.",

However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of how 3D printing is impacting on manufacturing eco-systems within different industries and contexts. Drawing inspiration from earlier manufacturing taxonomies as well as the competitive dynamics literature which provides insights into industries' moves from straightforwardly rivalrous frameworks, through competitive-cooperative exemplars, into the more recent relational-based competition. Basing our analysis on a systematic review of organisations' use of 3D printing, we develop a new taxonomy explaining the many areas the technology can impact. In addition to offering a comprehensive framework to conceptualise the impact of 3D printing, we emphasise the role of users in co-creation and personalisation. While 3D printing has been touted as disruptive, we suggest that our new taxonomy offers a richer understanding of the ways firms can operate in a 3D printing context. We furthermore apply the relational competition category of the competitive dynamics model to our taxonomy, showing how 3D printing influences the modes and aims of competition, roster of actors and action toolkits within the different industry sectors.",

abstract = "Elastic optical networks (EONs) provide flexibility to assign wide range of spectral resources to the connection requests. In this manuscript, we address two issues related to spectrum assignment in EONs: the non uniform spectrum assignment along different links of the route and the spectrum fragmentation in the network. To address these issues, two routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) strategies have been proposed: Least Loaded RSA (LLRSA) and Route Fragmentation Aware RSA (RFARSA). The LLRSA allocates spectrum homogeneously along different links in the network, where as RFARSA accords priority to the routes which are less fragmented. To highlight the salient features of the two strategies, two new metrics, route fragmentation index (RFI) and standard deviation (SD) are introduced. RFI is defined as the ratio of non-contiguous FSs to the total available free FSs on the route, and SD relates to the measure of non-uniformity in the allocation of resources on the links in the network. A simulation program has been developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed (LLRSA and RFARSA) strategies, and the existing strategies of shortest path RSA (SPRSA) and spectrum compactness based defragmentation (SCD) strategies, on the metric of RFI, bandwidth blocking probability (BBP), network capacity utilized, and SD. The variation in the metrics on the basis of number of requests and the bandwidth (number of FSs) requested has been studied. It has been conclusively established that the proposed strategies (LLRSA and RFARSA) outperform the existing strategies in terms of all the metrics.",

The system is composed of fundus image pre-processing, image feature extraction, and automatic cataract classification and grading. The wavelet transform and the sketch based methods are investigated to extract from fundus image the features suitable for cataract classification and grading. After feature extraction, a multiclass discriminant analysis algorithm is used for cataract classification, including two-class (cataract or non-cataract) classification and cataract grading in mild, moderate, and severe. A real-world dataset, including fundus image samples with mild, moderate, and severe cataract, is used for training and testing. The preliminary results show that, for the wavelet transform based method, the correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 90.9% and 77.1%, respectively. The correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 86.1% and 74.0% for the sketch based method, which is comparable to the wavelet transform based method. The pilot study demonstrates that our research on fundus image analysis for cataract classification and grading is very helpful for improving the efficiency of fundus image review and ophthalmic healthcare quality. We believe that this work can serve as an important reference for the development of similar health information system to solve other medical diagnosis problems.",

However, these systems usually operate in complex environments that entail uncertain, highly dynamic, or irregular workload.

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-logic-based adjustable autonomy (FLAA) model to manage the autonomy of multi-agent systems that are operating in complex environments. This model aims to facilitate the autonomy management of agents and help them make competent autonomous decisions. The FLAA model employs fuzzy logic to quantitatively measure and distribute autonomy among several agents based on their performance. We implement and test this model in the Automated Elderly Movements Monitoring (AEMM-Care) system, which uses agents to monitor the daily movement activities of elderly users and perform fall detection and prevention tasks in a complex environment. The test results show that the FLAA model improves the accuracy and performance of these agents in detecting and preventing falls.",

This makes it possible to recharge a battery or super-capacitor even if a patient is not moving. The use of a permanent magnet coupling has potential advantages compared to traditional inductive or ultrasonic methods, e.g. in terms of tissue damage and transmission depth. Simulation results show the achievable coupling torque for different configurations of magnet geometries and relative positions between the driving magnet stack(s) and the harvester. It is shown that using a single magnet stack yields better results than using two diametrically opposite stacks. Measurements are performed with different magnets, driving frequencies and orientations of the harvester. The results are discussed and successful energy transfer was achieved regardless of the orientation of the device with respect to gravity, which is desirable for real world applications. Lateral misalignment between the harvester and the driving magnet can also be overcome. The largest distance of power transfer reached was 32mm with the largest magnets tested, and the optimal power output into a resistive load was over 100μW at a frequency of 25Hz. The functional volume of the harvester is 1.85cm3 – similar to the size of a wristwatch.",

They were, however, mainly designed for static scenarios and are therefore not well-suited for dynamic environments in which continuous reasoning over such heterogeneous knowledge with constantly arriving streams of data is necessary. In this paper, we introduce reactive multi-context systems (rMCSs), a framework for reactive reasoning in the presence of heterogeneous knowledge sources and data streams. We show that rMCSs are indeed well-suited for this purpose by illustrating how several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be handled using them, by showing how inconsistencies possibly occurring in the integration of multiple knowledge sources can be handled, and by arguing that the potential non-determinism of rMCSs can be avoided if needed using an alternative, more skeptical well-founded semantics instead with beneficial computational properties. We also investigate the computational complexity of various reasoning problems related to rMCSs. Finally, we discuss related work, and show that rMCSs do not only generalize mMCSs to dynamic settings, but also capture/extend relevant approaches w.r.t. dynamics in knowledge representation and stream reasoning.",

Since noise is not spectrally white in the presence of NBI in UWB systems, conventional matched filter based receivers are not optimum in such scenarios. Although NBI mitigation methods have been proposed using NBI subspace and/or limiters for UWB systems, subspace-based approaches are usually not feasible due to no apriori knowledge of the NBI subspace in a real scenario, and the limiter-based approach is also non-optimum. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-based NBI mitigation method that exploits distinct characteristics of UWB signals and NBI, and does not require a limiter. Improved performance of the proposed receiver has been validated via time hopping binary phase shift keying (TH-BPSK) UWB signal transmission in both additive white Gaussian noise and multipath fading channels.",

The adoption of Product-Service Systems (PSS) strategies appears as a promising solution. However, practical application of PSS sustainable approaches is still limited. This may be associated to the fact that a PSS does not guarantee environmental improvements if it is not specifically designed with this purpose. PSS design process models can play a relevant role in supporting companies in designing sustainable PSS when they incorporate activities, methods and tools to approach the sustainability dimensions. Not only the process models, but also the intentions of practitioners and their awareness towards sustainability during the design of a PSS influence the dissemination of sustainable PSS. The objective of this work is to investigate whether the existent PSS design process models support the design of sustainable PSS and whether practitioners employ sustainability-related activities when designing PSS. Nine process models were analyzed and the perspective of practitioners about considering sustainability issues when designing PSS were captured. The collected data shows that only few of the analyzed process models actually propose activities, methods or tools to support a sustainable PSS design. This suggests an existing gap between literature and the practitioners’ expectations of PSS design process models. Moreover, those activities, methods and tools are mainly focused on eco-efficiency and the social dimension is generally not covered.",

abstract = "Background
Bariatric surgery research, often longitudinal, bears the challenge of maintaining retention and decreasing attrition of participants to avoid bias.
Objectives
To explore factors influencing the retention and attrition for bariatric surgical research participants.
Methods
Databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and others. As a secondary aim, studies reporting on retention/attrition factors in clinical follow-up visits were included.
Results
Of the 1145 articles retrieved, 44 met inclusion criteria, and underwent qualitative analysis. Four descriptive articles focused on longitudinal research participation and 40 on clinical follow-up visits. Willingness to participate in research was high (92%) and decreased with more invasive procedures or extra visits. A large observational longitudinal study presented 24-month retention/attrition data (92% for some data and 66% visit completion) and the retention strategies employed. One study indicated that research follow-up possibly increased clinical follow-up and another demonstrated a higher retention by increasing compensation. No consistent, modifiable demographic or psychosocial variables associated or predictive of retention or attrition in clinical follow-up were identified.
Conclusions
Research on factors related to participant retention and attrition is sparse. It is essential for studies to document retention/attrition data. Existing research has demonstrated a patient willingness to participate in research and that retention strategies have been successful in the short term. Further research should explore the motivations, perspectives and attitudes of bariatric surgical research participants regarding participation and explore predictors to develop evidence-based retention strategies. Research has yet to identify consistent and modifiable demographic or psychosocial variables predictive of clinical follow-up, possibly due to the heterogeneity of follow-up across studies. Further investigation into follow-up definition, content, counseling approaches, and new telemedicine technologies may prove helpful in developing predictors and evidence-based strategies. The relationship between research and clinical retention and attrition deserves further characterization.",

This formulation is gaining interest because it naturally fits various problems and allows to leverage weakly labeled data. Consequently, it has been used in diverse application fields such as computer vision and document classification. However, learning from bags raises important challenges that are unique to MIL. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the characteristics which define and differentiate the types of MIL problems. Until now, these problem characteristics have not been formally identified and described. As a result, the variations in performance of MIL algorithms from one data set to another are difficult to explain. In this paper, MIL problem characteristics are grouped into four broad categories: the composition of the bags, the types of data distribution, the ambiguity of instance labels, and the task to be performed. Methods specialized to address each category are reviewed. Then, the extent to which these characteristics manifest themselves in key MIL application areas are described. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art MIL methods on selected problem characteristics. This paper provides insight on how the problem characteristics affect MIL algorithms, recommendations for future benchmarking and promising avenues for research.

In this article, we propose a general delivery scheme for Manycast group communications based on mobile code. Our proposal extends network addressing by moving from the static header field paradigm to a software code-based addressing scheme. We allow messages to be delivered using built-in software codes that consider application-defined, context-aware or history-based information. Additionally, we allow messages to carry a delivery state that permits them to perform refined delivery-decision-making methods. As a consequence of this scheme, we have found that new group communication schemes, besides the traditional ones, may be beneficial to improve the network performance and to provide new functionalities to emerging scenarios like intermittently connected networks of heterogeneous physical objects. We present an application of this scheme to solve, following an analytical delivery method, the problem of sending a message to k and only k nodes of a heterogeneous and opportunistic network scenario that fit best a given criterion. We show, using simulations, that our proposal performs better than traditional approaches. Finally, to show that our proposal is feasible, we present an implementation of our proposal in a real Opportunistic Ad Hoc network, a DTN network, compatible with the de facto standard Bundle Protocol.",

This system is able to feed one or more wearable sensor nodes, attached to the patient, with the purpose of wirelessly recording vital signals over an extended period of time. Each of these power transmitters is designed to transfer up to 10mW of power over a maximal distance of 300mm. Moreover, the platform embeds online optimization software to deal with vertical as well as horizontal sensor node movements. The position and orientation of each freely moving sensor node can be dynamically determined and a local magnetic field, with a matching radiated power level, can be selectively induced in the area where the sensor nodes are positioned. This approach therefore limits the radiation exposure to the patient to the minimum viable level. The prototype is successfully tested in a laboratory set-up.",

Several studies have highlighted the need to maintain and build manufacturing capabilities to support economic growth and have linked a nation's as well as region's strength in manufacturing to its ability to innovate. In the U.S., where a manufacturing strategy has largely been absent for the past 25years, advanced manufacturing capabilities are now seen as essential to the development of new products and processes across a range of industries. Against this backdrop, Massachusetts presents an interesting case since manufacturing in this U.S. state is integral to several of its most important industry clusters, yet it is a high wage, high costs state that must compete globally. This research examines the pathways and opportunities for building and fostering innovation capacity among Massachusetts manufacturers, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We employ a systems approach to conduct analytic and empirical analyses that consider how knowledge and sources of innovation flow between key participants within the manufacturing innovation ecosystem. We find that the Massachusetts manufacturing innovation ecosystem is rich in terms of assets but relatively poor in terms of interconnectedness between those assets. In addition, rather than being focused on demand-driven innovation and technological upgrading for SMEs, non-market state-supported manufacturing intermediaries are primarily focused on supply-side, point solutions that work with individual firms rather than at a systems level.",

The opportunities arising from the analysis of such information need to be balanced with the risks for the data protection of individuals. In this sense, the anonymization technique might be a solution, but it seems to be inappropriate in certain circumstances, among which Big Data processing can be included. In fact, anonymization has a high degree of uncontrollability of the impacts of profiling directed to individual targets whose data has been anonymized. In this sense, pseudonymization can be used both to reduce the risks of reidentification and help data controllers and processors to respect their personal data protection obligations by keeping control over their activities. On the one hand, pseudonymization ensures the capability to reconstruct the processes of identity masking, by allowing re-identification. On the other hand the accountability of the data controller and data processor is guaranteed, thanks to the fact that there will always be a person who can re-identify subjects included in a cluster, acting as a “data keeper”.",

In these networks mobility support is a key issue in order to keep patients under real-time monitoring even when they move around. To keep sensors connected to the network, they should change their access points of attachment when patients move to a new coverage area along an infirmary. This process, called handover, is responsible for continuous network connectivity to the sensors. This paper presents a detailed performance evaluation study considering three handover mechanisms for healthcare scenarios (Hand4MAC, RSSI-based, and Backbone-based). The study was performed by simulation using several scenarios with different number of sensors and different moving velocities of sensor nodes. The results show that Hand4MAC is the best solution to guarantee almost continuous connectivity to sensor nodes with less energy consumption.",

Second, a power level and packet size decision (PPD) algorithm is presented to decide the optimal packet size, by either minimizing the delay at a prescribed transmission power or minimizing energy consumption with a prescribed delay. Third, a global link decision (GLD) scheme is devised to improve overall reliability and decrease overall delay simultaneously through raising availability of battery energy within nodes. Theoretical analysis demonstrated the validity of the GLD scheme. Moreover, experimental results show that the GLD scheme improves the transmission reliability by 8.70% and decreases the delay by 7.74%, without reducing the network lifetime, which was not achieved in previous research studies.",

abstract = "The number of people with a chronic disease is rapidly increasing, giving the healthcare industry more challenging problems. To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology–aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-making knowledge using Protégé Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient for patient risk factors extraction and diabetes prescriptions.",

This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘(’omic)’ approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established’omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially SNPs and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.",

abstract = "Introduction
Smart watches have the potential to support health in everyday living by: enabling self-monitoring of personal activity; obtaining feedback based on activity measures; allowing for in-situ surveys to identify patterns of behavior; and supporting bi-directional communication with health care providers and family members. However, smart watches are an emerging technology and research with these devices is at a nascent stage.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of smart watch studies that engaged people in their use by searching PubMed, Embase, IEEE XPlore and ACM Digital libraries. Participant demographics, device features, watch applications and methods, and technical challenges were abstracted from included studies.
Results
Seventy-three studies were returned in the search. Seventeen studies published were included. Included studies were published from 2014 to 2016, with the exception of one published in 2011. Most studies employed the use of consumer-grade smart watches (14/17, 82%). Patient-related studies focused on activity monitoring, heart rate monitoring, speech therapy adherence, diabetes self-management, and detection of seizures, tremors, scratching, eating, and medication-taking behaviors. Most patient-related studies enrolled participants with few exclusion criteria to validate smart watch function (10/17, 58%). Only studies that focused on Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and diabetes management enrolled persons living with targeted conditions. One study focused on nursing work in the ICU and one focused on CPR training for laypeople.
Conclusion
Consumer-grade smart watches have penetrated the health research space rapidly since 2014. Smart watch technical function, acceptability, and effectiveness in supporting health must be validated in larger field studies that enroll actual participants living with the conditions these devices target.",

In these highly fluid operational environments, involving information providers and consumers of various degrees of trust and intentions, information transformation, such as obfuscation, is used to manage the inferences that could be made to protect providers from misuses of the information they share, while still providing benefits to their information consumers. In this paper, we develop the initial principles for relating to inference management and the role that trust and obfuscation plays in it within the context of this emerging breed of applications. We start by extending the definitions of trust and obfuscation into this emerging application space. We, then, highlight their role as we move from the tightly-coupled to loosely-coupled sensory-inference systems and describe how quality, value and risk of information relate in collaborative and adversarial systems. Next, we discuss quality distortion illustrated through a human activity recognition sensory system. We then present a system architecture to support an inference firewall capability in a publish/subscribe system for sensory information and conclude with a discussion and closing remarks.",

For this purpose, a micro-patterning method of electrospun metal oxide nanofibers based on electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing process was developed in this work. Several types of metal oxide (SnO2, In2O3, WO3 and NiO) nanofibers that were produced by electrospinning, fragmented into smaller pieces by ultrasonication, and dissolved in organic solvents were utilized as inks for the printing. Constant or pulsed wave bias consisting of base and jetting voltages were applied between a nozzle and a substrate to generate a jetting of nanofiber solutions. Several parameters for EHD printing such as pulse width, inner diameter of the nozzle, distance from the nozzle to the substrate, and stage speed, were optimized for accurate micro-patterning of electrospun nanofibers. By using optimized printing parameters, microscale patterns of electrospun nanofibers with a minimum diameter less than 50μm could be realized. Gas sensors were fabricated by EHD printing on the microelectrodes and then used for the detection of toxic gases such as NO2, CO and H2S. Four kinds of metal oxides could detect down to 0.1ppm of NO2, 1ppm of H2S and 20ppm of CO gases. Also, heterogeneous nanofiber gas sensor array was fabricated by the same printing method and could detect NO2 using the sensor array platform with microheaters. Furthermore, microscale patterns of nanofibers by EHD printing could be applied to the suspended MEMS platform without any structural damage and this sensor array could detect NO2 and H2S gases with 20mW power consumption.",

However, the previously demonstrated electrodes are generally limited to a very small areal capacitance density at 120Hz due to sub-μm thick electrode used for meeting frequency requirement, which renders them unsuitable for practical ECs. Here, using crosslinked carbon nanofiber aerogel, derived from rapid microwave plasma pyrolysis of bacterial cellulose that was synthesized in a fermentation process, we demonstrated kHz HF-ECs with areal capacitance density as high as 4.5mFcm−2 at 120Hz in an aqueous electrolyte. The cruciality of plasma pyrolysis on high frequency response of the derived carbon nanofiber aerogel was discussed. The electrode performance in an organic electrolyte was further studied for operation in a large potential window of more than 3V. Using such kHz HF-ECs, we further demonstrated their applications in rapid pulse energy storage for vibrational energy harvesting, as well as in ripple current filtering for AC/DC conversion. The promising results suggest this technology has great potential for developing practical compact HF-ECs in substitution of electrolytic capacitors for several crucial applications.",

It seeks to develop and highlight a systematic methodological framework for handling multivariate big data in a smart urban decision support context in the ‘New Urban World’, so as to enhance the cities’ competitive performance through the design and development of operational urban management principles and strategies. The specific aim of this paper is to provide the critical and basic cornerstones for an applicable interactive dashboard architecture as a supporting tool in a structured process of innovative city strategies and consequent enhanced socio-economic performance. A core element in the present paper is formed by a smart urban dashboard system that acts as an interactive navigation tool supporting operational choices of all stakeholders involved. This dashboard is able to integrate complex and ever-changing big data bases serving as ‘signposts’ of city intelligence (or i-city smartness) for daily or strategic decisions of all urban stakeholders. This study thus outlines successively the concept of smart i-cities in our ‘urban century’, the great potential of digital technology for managing big data in governing i-cities, and the foundations of an urban dashboard on the basis of the so-called Pentagon model as a policy strategy vehicle. Starting from extensive data on a broad set of global cities, the potential of this approach is exemplified by means of an illustrative application of a smart urban dashboard for the city of Stockholm.",

SlugCam was designed such that it can be deployed and left unattended for extended periods without requiring regular maintenance, e.g., frequent battery replacement. The system is built with off-the-shelf components which not only keeps it modular and low cost, but also facilitates its prototyping, rapid duplication, and evolution. SlugCam’s on-board processing capability allows computer vision software to run locally and autonomously. Energy efficiency in SlugCam is accomplished both in: (1) hardware by micro-managing low-power components; as well as in (2) software by having the system’s operation duty cycles automatically adapt to the current state of the battery in order to balance the trade-off between application-level requirements and power awareness. For example, SlugCam’s smart camera node changes its monitoring behavior based on how much battery charge remains. Additionally, using its computer vision software, the system only records and transmits information upon event detection which contributes both to the system’s energy efficiency as well as its low network bandwidth requirements. SlugCam’s networking functionality enables camera nodes to transfer video files, as well as collaborate on tasks such as visual processing, event detection, and object tracking. It allows node-to-node, as well as scoped- or full broadcast communication. For point-to-point communication, SlugCam uses on-demand power-aware multi-path routing to transfer video files efficiently. Another important contribution of SlugCam is to provide an open-source wireless camera network that can adapt to address the requirements of future outdoor video monitoring applications. SlugCam also includes a Web-based server where video data is stored as well as a Web-based user interface that allows end users to interact with the system, tag, query and retrieve video files, and manage SlugCam nodes remotely. In addition to a detailed description of SlugCam, this paper presents an extensive power characterization of the system’s operation and showcases its deployment in a lab testbed and a real world scenario.",

The most adaptive and innovative research avenues are being considered in an urban environment, where WSN deployment is especially demanding due to its harsh and perverse channel conditions. We have chosen WSN deployment in an urban environment as linchpin of our research. As each application scenario is different from the other, therefore WSN solution for each application has to be adaptive and innovative. We have discussed each application of WSNs in urban areas in detail with all the problems related to it and in the end, technical solution to those problems has been discussed.",

The research in this field has attracted academia and industry alike. The objective is to help severely disabled people to live their life as regular persons as much as possible. Some of these disabilities are categorized as neurological neuromuscular disorders. A BCI system goes through many phases including preprocessing, feature extraction, signal classifications, and finally control. Large body of research are found at each phase and this might confuse researchers and BCI developers. This article is a review to the state-of-the-art work in the field of BCI. The main focus of this review is on the Brain control signals, their types and classifications. In addition, this survey reviews the current BCI technology in terms of hardware and software where the most used BCI devices are described as well as the most utilized software platforms are explained. Finally, BCI challenges and future directions are stated. Due to the limited space and large body of literature in the field of BCI, another two review articles are planned. One of these articles reviews the up-to-date BCI algorithms and techniques for signal processing, feature extraction, signals classification, and control. Another article will be dedicated to BCI systems and applications. The three articles are written as base and guidelines for researchers and developers pursue the work in the field of BCI.",

In this paper, we introduce the concept of context similarity among entities and derive a similarity network. Then, we define a trust model that allows us to establish trust along a path of entities.

This paradigm has opened the Service Cloud to a variety of wireless devices especially those with sensorial and actuating capabilities. Those pervasive networks contribute to build new context-aware applications that interpret the state of the physical world at real-time. However, traditional Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), which are widely used in the current Internet are unsuitable for such resource-constraint devices since they are too heavy. In this research paper, an internetworking approach is proposed in order to address that important issue. The main part of our proposal is the Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented (KASO) Middleware that has been designed for pervasive embedded networks. KASO Middleware implements a diversity of mechanisms, services and protocols which enable developers and business processing designers to deploy, expose, discover, compose, and orchestrate real-world services (i.e. services running on sensor/actuator devices). Moreover, KASO Middleware implements endpoints to offer those services to the Cloud in a REST manner. Our internetworking approach has been validated through a real healthcare telemonitoring system deployed in a sanatorium. The validation tests show that KASO Middleware successfully brings pervasive embedded networks to the Service Cloud.",

This trend allows data collected from machines in operation to interact with cyberspace computers through a communication network, thus forming the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Besides, rapid advances in information and communications technologies provide approaches for analysing data, in an increasingly rapid, autonomously, ubiquitous and in real time way, providing information that assists humans in making better decisions. In this sense, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of machines, is indicated as a promising application of Smart Manufacturing in the CPS context, demanding the standardization of concepts, terms, and a formal implementation of data collection and treatment. For this purpose, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology is used in this paper, encompassing international standards, the unified 5-level architecture, ontology, and dependability for failure analysis in mechanical components. In addition, the creation of an ontology using the OWL 2 language was guided by the ‘Ontology Development 101′ approach. A pilot test was carried out using a centrifugal pump to demonstrate the applicability of the ontology. Thus, the ontology is evaluated in Protégé, which allow queries with SPARQL language to provide future decision-making for condition-based maintenance in real processes.",

abstract = "IoT clusters arise from natural human societal clusters such as a house, an airport, and a highway. IoT clusters are heterogeneous with a need for device to device as well as device to user trust. The IoT devices are likely to be thin computing clients. Due to low cost, an individual IoT device is not built to be fault tolerant through redundancy. Hence the trust protocols cannot take the liveness of a device for granted. In fact, the differentiation between a failing device and a malicious device is difficult from the trust protocol perspective. We present a minimal distributed trust layer based on distributed consensus like operations. These distributed primitives are cast in the context of the APIs supported by a trusted platform module (TPM). TPM with its 1024bit RSA is a significant burden on a thin IoT design. We use RNS based slicing of a TPM where in each slice resides within a single IoT device. The overall TPM functionality is distributed among several IoT devices within a cluster. The VLSI area, energy, and time savings of such a distributed TMP implementation is assessed. A sliced/distributed TPM is better suited for an IoT environment based on its resource needs. We demonstrate over 90% time reduction, over 3% area reduction, and over 90% energy reduction per IoT node in order to support TPM protocols.",

It represents an urban model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will present in this paper.",

These issues go beyond questions of clinical utility and validity to those of data security, personal identity, race, and the nature of the family. Robust DTC testing has the power to provide meaningful clinical, genealogical and even forensic information to those who want it; in unscrupulous hands, however, it also has the power to deceive and exploit.

However, another important group is overlooked in most of the research and technical development: care professionals. They use assistive devices every day. To consider them as users and facilitators of assistive technology has become even more important, since new capacities of technology and comprehensive visions of robotics have started to change the relation between care workers and technology significantly. In Berlin, Germany, we conducted a series of qualitative interviews with care professionals who work in care services or advise on technical aids for the elderly. Our main focus was on the experiences of the care professionals with assistive technology: on the kind of assistive technology they use, the benefits and difficulties they experience using technology, the visions they have etc. We found out that care professionals perceived technology to be in competition with important aspects of care. The results reflect the changing relation between care workers and assistive technology.",

Understanding this driver requires knowing how much allocated IPv4 space is actively used over time – a non-trivial goal due to privacy concerns and practical measurement challenges. To address this gap we present a collaborative and privacy-preserving capture-recapture (CR) technique for estimating IP address space utilisation. Public and private datasets of IP addresses observed by multiple independent collaborators can be combined for CR analysis, without any individual collaborator’s privately observed addresses leaking to the others. We show that CR estimation is much more accurate than assuming all used addresses are observed, and that our scheme scales well to datasets of over a billion addresses across several collaborators. We estimate that 1.2 billion IPv4 addresses and 6.5 million /24 subnets were actively used at the end of 2014, and also analyse address usage depending on RIR and country.",

A resource monitoring system can observe the individual resource consumption of the devices in an industrial plant to detect excessive resource consumption while considering context information such as the process steps or varying energy costs. A systematic approach for the semantic integration of relevant information is a key requirement to infer reliable monitoring states of the devices. Recent research explores how future industrial plants may use decentralized autonomous devices. To integrate such autonomous devices in a monitoring system, semantic models are required that describe the devices and their data, thus we need knowledge-based approaches. To date, the research on knowledge-based systems in the industrial domain has tended to focus on application-specific solutions rather than on generic solutions that integrate knowledge of multiple sources. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-engineering methodology to build a generic, reusable resource monitoring system for industrial plants which includes multiple knowledge sources. This approach can also be used to develop knowledge-based systems for other applications such as diagnostic or prognostic systems.",

In the manufacturing sector, the improvement of energy efficiency is a challenging task due to the complexity of manufacturing systems and the requirements for flexible operation targeting highly customised products. Towards this end, the estimation of the energy consumption of a machining task, and therefore the machining cost, is necessary. This paper presents a machine tool monitoring methodology that integrates sensory systems, a scheduling module, and human operators to perform real-time monitoring on the shop-floor. A monitoring system is designed to capture real-time measurements from sensors attached on machine tools and perform the necessary pre-processing to transmit these measurements to a Cloud server via wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, the input from human operators is utilized to collect the machining parameters. The collected information is fused through an information fusion mechanism to extract meaningful results. The results are stored in a database for the reuse in future tasks by estimating the energy consumption of new cases, through a case-based reasoning approach, prior the job dispatching. Therefore, the machining parameters of the new case can be modified targeting energy consumption reduction. The proposed system is delivered as a Cloud software-as-a-service to realise the philosophy of Cloud manufacturing.",

An SPL product is derived from a configuration of features which need to be compounded together without violating their particular specifications. While it is easy to identify the behavior of a feature in isolation, specifying and resolving interactions among features may not be a straightforward task. The feature interaction problem has been a challenging subject for decades. Objective: This study aims at surveying existing research on feature interaction in SPL engineering in order to identify common practices and research trends. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of seven research questions, in which the 35 studies found are mainly classified regarding the feature interaction solution presented: detection, resolution and general analysis. Results: 43% of the papers deal with feature interaction at early phases of a software lifecycle. The remaining is shared among the other categories: source code detection, resolution and analysis. For each category, it was also identified the main strategies used to deal with interactions. Conclusions: The findings can help to understand the needs in feature interaction for SPL engineering, and highlight aspects that still demand an additional investigation. For example, often strategies are partial and only address specific points of a feature interaction investigation.",

abstract = "Smart wearable devices offer much potential to assist citizens in disasters. To the general public, however, using these devices for disaster applications is still a novel concept. In disasters, most people are reluctant to rely on unfamiliar technologies. Thus, for these devices to become truly useful in disasters, it is important to understand factors that affect their acceptance by the public. Previous studies show that perceived usefulness is a clear antecedent of people’s acceptance of smart wearable devices. However, the underlying factors that affect perceived usefulness itself are not clearly known. Thus, the aim of this study is to fill this gap, and by doing so, to derive some practical implications for solution developers and governments. This study used structural equation modelling to analyse survey data collected from 647 respondents in Japan. We found that the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications of smart wearable devices was a strong predictor of their perceived usefulness of using these devices for disaster applications. Although indirect factors such as the ownership of ICT gadgets and the usage of social media also had some influences, most of their effects were mediated through increasing the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications. In other words, through appreciating the functions of the current applications of smart wearable devices, people can visualise the usefulness of these devices in disaster situations. That being said, we found that in parallel, people also had concerns on the privacy issues of these devices. These findings shed light on the promotion and development of this fast growing technology for disaster applications.",

The key feature of IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mechanism is to allow the sensors to plan the time-slot schedule for efficient data transmission. However, the standard does not specify how to plan a time-slot schedule so that data collected by the sensors can be received by the base station as soon as possible without being delayed by transmission conflicts. In this paper, we propose a constant-time, distributed time-slot scheduling algorithm to address this problem. Existing works on IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH scheduling depend on one or a few nodes to collect traffic-flow information from their descendants and plan a centralized time-slot schedule for the whole network. In contrast, our algorithm allows every sensor node to compute its time-slot schedule in a simple, truly distributed manner. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art protocol in terms of the packet transmission delay and yields a smaller duty cycle.",

As a result, the information resources can be taken full advantage of so as to help miners to improve their safety condition, which are not just accessible to the management staff. However, there is not a detailed discussion or an in-depth research on the implementation of service system at present. In order to bridge the gap between the theory and the practice in the field, three critical problems need to be solved: (1) How to model the served miners’ context? (2) How to provide the information services to meet miners’ customized demands? (3) How to verify the availability of service invocation? According to the characteristics and practical needs of coal mine, this paper first proposes the Coal Mine Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (CMSSN) to build miner's context model, which can facilitate reusing the context resources in different coal mines. Then, the configuration model connecting context information and business services is constructed to realize the customized service invocation. Thirdly, the method of computational experiment is proposed to verify the availability and validity of service system, i.e. whether the service system can provide the suitable service on time in various virtual accident experiments. A case study is given to explain how to implement the computational experiment on a virtual coal mine simulation platform. Finally, the potential problems in realizing the system are discussed, which will be our research focus in future. PACS: 75.40.-s; 71.20.LP",

Big Data platforms allow the storage and analysis of high volumes of data with heterogeneous format from different sources. This integrated analysis allows the derivation of properties and correlations among data that can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as making predictions that can profitably affect decision processes. As a matter of fact, nowadays Big Data analytics are generally considered an asset for making business decisions. Big Data platforms have been specifically designed to support advanced form of analytics satisfying strict performance and scalability requirements. However, no proper consideration has been devoted so far to data protection. Indeed, although the analyzed data often include personal and sensitive information, with relevant threats to privacy implied by the analysis, so far Big Data platforms integrate quite basic form of access control, and no support for privacy policies. Although the potential benefits of data analysis are manifold, the lack of proper data protection mechanisms may prevent the adoption of Big Data analytics by several companies. This motivates the fundamental need to integrate privacy and security awareness into Big Data platforms. In this paper, we do a first step to achieve this ambitious goal, discussing research issues related to the definition of a framework that supports the integration of privacy aware access control features into existing Big Data platforms.",

abstract = "Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.). These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information, whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However, it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment analysis and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation activities (accidents, vehicles, street conditions, traffic volume, etc.) and to make a city-feature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by using Protégé web ontology language (OWL) and Java, respectively. The experimental results show satisfactory improvement in tweet and review analysis and opinion mining.",

abstract = "The introduction of ICT in techno-socio-economic systems, such as Smart Grids, traffic management, food supply chains and others, transforms the role of simulation as a scientific method for studying these complex systems. The scientific focus and challenge in simulations move from understanding system complexity to actually prototyping online and distributed regulatory mechanisms for supporting system operations. Existing simulation tools are not designed to address the challenges of this new reality, however, simulation is all about capturing reality at an adequate level of detail. This paper fills this gap by introducing a Java-based distributed simulation framework for inter-connected and inter-dependent techno-socio-economic system: SFINA, the Simulation Framework for Intelligent Network Adaptations. Three layers outline the design approach of SFINA: (i) integration of domain knowledge and dynamics that govern various techno-socio-economic systems, (ii) system modeling with dynamic flow networks represented by temporal directed weighted graphs and (iii) simulation of generic regulation models, policies and mechanisms applicable in several domains. SFINA aims at minimizing the fragmentation and discrepancies between different simulation communities by allowing the interoperability of SFINA with several other existing domain backends. The coupling of three such backends with SFINA is illustrated in the domain of Smart Grids and disaster mitigation. It is shown that the same model of cascading failures in Smart Grids is developed once and evaluated with both MATPOWER and InterPSS backends without changing a single line of application code. Similarly, application code developed in SFINA is reused for the evaluation of mitigation strategies in a backend that simulates the flows of a disaster spread. Results provide a proof-of-concept for the high modularity and reconfigurability of SFINA and puts the foundations of a new generation of simulation tools that prototype and validate online decentralized regulation in techno-socio-economic systems.",

abstract = "Future low-end embedded systems will make an increased use of heterogeneous MPSoCs. To utilize these systems efficiently, methods and tools are required that support the extraction and implementation of parallelism typically found in embedded applications. Ideally, large amounts of existing legacy code should be reused and ported to these new systems. Existing parallelization infrastructures, however, mostly support parallelization according to the requirements of HPEC systems. For resource-restricted embedded systems, different parallelization strategies are necessary to achieve additional non-functional objectives such as the reduction of energy consumption. HPC-focused parallelization also assumes processor, memory and communication structures different from low-end embedded systems and therefore wastes optimization opportunities essential for improving the performance of resource-constrained embedded systems. This paper describes a new approach and infrastructure inspired by the OpenMP API to support the extraction and implementation of pipeline parallelism, which is commonly found in complex embedded applications. In addition, advanced techniques to extract parallelism from legacy applications requiring only minimal code modifications are presented. Further, the resulting toolflow combines advanced parallelization, mapping and communication optimization tools leading to a more efficient approach to exploit parallelism for typical embedded applications on heterogeneous MPSoCs running distributed real-time operating systems.",

abstract = "The explosion in the volume of data generated by end-point devices, arising from IoT proliferation, has lead to the adoption of data outsourcing to dedicated data centers. However, centralized data centers such as cloud storage cannot afford to manage large stores of data in a timely manner. To allow low latency access to large amounts of data, a new computing paradigm, called fog computing, has been introduced. In a fog computing environment, privacy issues surrounding outsourced data become more critical due to its complicated innards of the system. In addition, efficient resource management is another important criterion considering the application of pay-per-use in commercial fog storage. As an extension of cloud storage, most fog storage service providers will choose to adopt data deduplication techniques to minimize resource dissipation. At the same time, data owners may update or remove outsourced data stored in the remote storage to reduce expenses. In this paper, we propose the first privacy-preserving deduplication protocol capable of efficient ownership management in fog computing. It achieves fine-grained access control by introducing user-level key management and update mechanisms. Data-invariant user-level private keys enable data owners to maintain a constant number of keys regardless of the number of outsourced data files. The update of user-level public keys for valid data owners at the remote storage dramatically reduces communication overhead. Security and performance analyses demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of communication and key management in fog storage.",

In order to develop such circuits, a wide variety of influences need to be considered and also compensated if necessary. For a complete consideration of all reliability issues, the circuit has to be investigated on different levels of abstraction and together with the complete overlying system. These requirements are addressed in this work by using cross-layer design methods for the development of a generic sensor interface as an example for a complex integrated circuit. During the development, a reliability-aware design is used and major physical effects are taken into account, which alter the overall behavior of the system. Furthermore, modeling techniques are applied to port influences and circuit components from one level of abstraction to another. Possible countermeasures and compensation techniques for a reliable circuit design are also analyzed on transistor and system level. The result is a sensor interface circuit, which can be used to investigate all effects of interest and suitable countermeasures on different abstraction levels.",

Recent security research notes a trend in which developers and vendors have opted out of implementing Bluetooth Low Energy link security in many devices, enabling protocol attacks and attack frameworks. To help defend devices with no link security, researchers recommend the use of Bluetooth Low Energy traffic sniffers to generate auditable communications logs. Unfortunately, current sniffers can only follow a single connection at a time, and some are ineffective at capturing long-lived connections due to synchronization problems. These limitations make current sniffers impractical for use in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents Bluetooth Low Energy Multi (BLE-Multi), a firmware enhancement to the open-source Ubertooth One that enables the sniffing of multiple simultaneous long-lived connections. To increase the capture effectiveness for long-lived connections, a novel synchronization mechanism is proposed that uses transmissions of empty packets to infer information about connection timing. Multi-connection sniffing is achieved by opportunistically switching between connections as they move from the active to inactive state, which is an inherent function in Bluetooth Low Energy to help conserve energy. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that BLE-Multi simultaneously captures multiple active connections while outperforming Ubertooth One when it captures a single connection, paving the way for the development and implementation of automated defensive tools for Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless sensor networks.",

Insight into business customer engagement (BCE), as expressed through social media and/or other B2B engagement-platforms (e.g. trade shows) and its S-D logic-based antecedents and consequences thus remains limited. Based on the observed gap, this paper integrates the theoretical entities of BCE, B2B social media engagement-platforms, and S-D logic and through its analyses, uncovers the related importance of the resource-based view (RBV) in affecting this association. An integrative S-D logic/RBV-informed model is developed, where BCE denotes an industrial customer's investment of operant/operand resources in supplier interactions via particular B2B engagement-platforms, including social media. The model considers business customer actors and resources in driving business customer resource integration, business customer resource integration effectiveness, and business customer resource integration efficiency, which act as BCE antecedents that extend to coincide with BCE. BCE, in turn, triggers business customer cocreation and relationship productivity, which subsequently, contribute to business customer relationship quality and ultimately, supplier performance. A set of research propositions is derived from the model, which serves as a useful guide for further research. Managerial implications focused on B2B social media marketing are discussed, before we conclude with an overview of research limitations and future research directions.",

abstract = "The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.",

abstract = "Modern data science uses topological methods to find the structural features of data sets before further supervised or unsupervised analysis. Geometry and topology are very natural tools for analysing massive amounts of data since geometry can be regarded as the study of distance functions. Mathematical formalism, which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques, deals with point cloud data sets, i.e. finite sets of points. It then adapts tools from the various branches of geometry and topology for the study of point cloud data sets. The point clouds are finite samples taken from a geometric object, perhaps with noise. Topology provides a formal language for qualitative mathematics, whereas geometry is mainly quantitative. Thus, in topology, we study the relationships of proximity or nearness, without using distances. A map between topological spaces is called continuous if it preserves the nearness structures. Geometrical and topological methods are tools allowing us to analyse highly complex data. These methods create a summary or compressed representation of all of the data features to help to rapidly uncover particular patterns and relationships in data. The idea of constructing summaries of entire domains of attributes involves understanding the relationship between topological and geometric objects constructed from data using various features. A common thread in various approaches for noise removal, model reduction, feasibility reconstruction, and blind source separation, is to replace the original data with a lower dimensional approximate representation obtained via a matrix or multi-directional array factorization or decomposition. Besides those transformations, a significant challenge of feature summarization or subset selection methods for Big Data will be considered by focusing on scalable feature selection. Lower dimensional approximate representation is used for Big Data visualization. The cross-field between topology and Big Data will bring huge opportunities, as well as challenges, to Big Data communities. This survey aims at bringing together state-of-the-art research results on geometrical and topological methods for Big Data.",

Different from most of the traditional methods, our proposed approach directly involves the competitive relationship among ISEs in the context of the availability of big data today. On the basis of the evidential reasoning (ER) approach and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency concept, we first construct a nonlinear programming model to portray the competitive relationship among ISEs, and obtain the optimal weight and the optimal utility value. Then, by applying the ER approach to the aggregate evaluation information, we obtain the ranking of the ISE CP performance. Finally, we use a numerical example to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the proposed approach and demonstrate its potential applications.",

Traditional lifelogging PA measures require relatively high cost and can only be conducted in controlled or semi-controlled environments, though they exhibit remarkable precision of PA monitoring outcomes. Recent advancement of commercial wearable devices and smartphones for recording one’s lifelogging PA has popularized data capture in uncontrolled environments. However, due to diverse life patterns and heterogeneity of connected devices as well as the PA recognition accuracy, lifelogging PA data measured by wearable devices and mobile phones contains much uncertainty thereby limiting their adoption for healthcare studies. To improve the feasibility of PA tracking datasets from commercial wearable/mobile devices, this paper proposes a lifelogging PA intensity pattern decision making approach for lifelong PA measures. The method is to firstly remove some irregular uncertainties (IU) via an Ellipse fitting model, and then construct a series of monthly based hour-day density map images for representing PA intensity patterns with regular uncertainties (RU) on each month. Finally it explores Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence fusing information from these density map images for generating a decision making model of a final personal lifelogging PA intensity pattern. The approach has significantly reduced the uncertainties and incompleteness of datasets from third party devices. Two case studies on a mobile personalized healthcare platform MHA [1] connecting the mobile app Moves are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed approach can improve effectiveness of PA tracking devices or apps for various types of people who frequently use them as a healthcare indicator.",

In the case of smartphone apps for fitness tracking, results of this data can be used similar to the growing application of global positioning systems for automotive travel surveying. The authors evaluate data from Travis County, Texas for the purpose of determining where bicyclists ride, primarily for fitness purposes. Ride trip volumes are evaluated with residential and employment density, land use diversity, bicycle facilities and terrain to characterize places chosen for bicycling for health. Though limited to bicycle rides and routes voluntarily logged using the smartphone app, this method provides promise for applications in multi-modal transportation planning and health impact assessment studies.",

The resulting system uses practical capacity to compute rates and is based on a hybrid of machining and labor times. The most innovative aspect is the use of real-time data on machine times in manufacturing, in the context of a large number and frequently changing products. The study also helps to better understand the limitations of time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), and it highlights the role of “data discovery” for the design of costing systems.",

Signifying more than simply the fair distribution of quantities of energy, energy justice also implies issues of procedural justice (participation) and recognition (acknowledgement of diverse values constitutive of ways of life). It is argued that this requires an acknowledgement of why energy use matters in everyday life. Data from the Energy Biographies project at Cardiff University is used to explore connections between the relational texture of everyday life and the ethical significance of energy. In particular, it is demonstrated that embodiment, attachment and narrative are features of sense-making that contribute significantly to everyday understandings of the ethical meanings of different ways of using energy. Using multimodal and biographical qualitative social science allows these implicit forms of evaluation to become more tangible, along with the relationships between them. Conceiving of energy consumers as subjects with biographies, with attachments, and as engaged bodily in energy consumption can open up, it is suggested, different ways of enacting the procedural and recognition aspects of energy justice.",

By means of a bottom-up approach, we show with scientific evidences that policy actions at product level have the potential to solve the apparent conundrum. The research is based on a case study related to the implementation of the European Union Ecodesign Directive to enterprise servers and data storage devices. The article proposes a novel approach to combine resource efficiency and data protection and cybersecurity issues, taking a preventative “by design” focus. This is built on the identification and subsequent proposal of solutions of the relevant market failures, i.e. situations in which the allocation of goods and services on a market is not efficient. Potential solutions are then translated into potential Ecodesign requirements for enterprise servers concerning: provision of information on the operation at high temperatures; availability of secure data deletion functionalities; availability of firmware updates to third parties; and design for disassembly of the product. We qualitatively and quantitatively assessed these requirements, in terms of energy and greenhouse gases emission savings, improved reusability, waste reduction, improved protection of personal data and security of the devices. The article concludes that a synergy between the environmental impact and the data protection and cybersecurity of these products – and the systems where they are installed (i.e. the data centres) – can be successfully achieved. Although the research work focused on a specific case study, the paper discusses finally how a similar approach could be applied to several other product groups characterised by similar market failures.",

This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.",

We propose an adaptive sampling scheme to collect accurate real-time traffic information from large-scale implementations of on-board GPS-based devices over a road network. The goal of the system is to minimize the transmission costs over all vehicles while satisfying requirements in the accuracy and timeliness of the traffic information obtained. The system is designed to make use of cellular communication as well as leveraging additional technologies such as roadside units equipped with WiFi and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). As opposed to fixed sampling schemes, which transmit at regular intervals, the sampling policy we propose is adaptive to the road network and the importance of the links that the vehicle traverses. Since cellular communications are costly, in the basic centralized scheme, the vehicle is not aware of the road conditions on the network. We extend the scheme to handle non-cellular communications via roadside units and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Under a general traffic model, we prove that our scheme always outperforms the baseline scheme in terms of transmission cost while satisfying accuracy and real-time requirements. Our analytical results are further supported via simulations based on actual road networks for both the centralized and V2V settings.",

In this paper, a novel SAW radio frequency identification (RFID) enabled temperature sensor is proposed for industrial applications, in which short measurement range but high accuracy is usually required. The encoding scheme for the sensor using pulse positions combined with phase information is adopted, and then the relationship between the length of a time slot and the decoding errors is deduced to ensure the sensor can be accurately identified, even though ambient temperature fluctuates. In order to solve the phase ambiguity problem involved in temperature measurements more efficiently and reduce the cost of obtaining the unwrapping temperature characteristic curves in the calibration process, an analytical procedure for calculating the variation of phase delay differences with respect to temperature has been proposed. A self-developed burst transceiver supporting online data analysis is also presented. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed SAW-RFID enabled temperature sensing scheme, and the prototype sensor within a temperature-controlled oven 2m away from the center of the transceiver antenna in a horizontal orientation achieves an accuracy of ±0.3°C in the temperature range 0–40°C.",

The second is the skill to express in turn its own emotional state, so that it can affect the customer buying decision, refining in the user the sense of interacting with a human-like companion.

However, little is known about the underlying nature of user trust or how early-stage credibility influences later-stage behavior and experience. To enhance the explanatory power and make it more applicable to health consumers' behavioral intentions, expectation-confirmation theory was extended by adding antecedents and moderating variables from the theory of planned behavior. With health informatics services in place, this study investigates how credibility influence other user perceptions such as perceived utility and how these perceptions together determine user intentions and behaviors concerning health informatics at both the initial and later stages of use. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of these attitudes and behaviors was carried out, and the results showed that perceived utility and credibility are critical at both the initial and later stages in user acceptance of health informatics services. Users' actual experiences modify their perceptions of utility and influence the confirmation of their initial expectations. These results have implications for the fundamental nature of credibility and perceived utility as well as their roles in the long-term sustainability of future health informatics services.",

abstract = "A smart grid has recently gained significant attention as it is an important direction of power system advancement. The integration of renewable energy (RE) resources to the power system and the reduction of energy losses need an efficient and low-cost communication infrastructure. Cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSN) can be integrated in a smart grid to meet these challenges. CRSN is a new paradigm of research where the best of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and cognitive radios (CR) is combined. The sensor networks monitor a physical parameter and the measures value is transmitted using the cognitive radio. Thus, CRSN can be used for realizing the sensing and communication part in a smart grid network. In this paper, a smart grid network is proposed using CRSN for implementing it in the remote areas of Pakistan. The service coverage map is taken from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) website that regulates the spectrum band in Pakistan. This can be used in developing countries to realize a cost effective smart grid for integrating the renewable resources and for reducing energy losses.",

Hence, the precision improvement is a significant issue that allows an effective data transmission between sensor network (SN) in order to save their energy and extend the network lifetime. In this work, we propose and implement a new mechanism for geographic routing. Therefore, the proposed mechanism is relied on a weighted centroid localization technique, where the positions of unknown nodes are calculated using fuzzy logic method. For this, we propose a fuzzy localization algorithm that uses flow measurement through wireless channel to compute the distance separating the anchor and the sensor nodes. Subsequently, our work is based on the centroid algorithm that calculates the position of unknown nodes using fuzzy Mamdani and Sugeno inference system for increasing the accuracy of estimated positions. Once the localization algorithm has detected the location of nodes with unknown position, the proposed mechanism selects effectively the next-elected CH to reduce the energy dissipation of sensor nodes, which leads to an extension of the network lifetime. The main advantages of the proposed mechanism are three folds: the first is to minimize the position error of nodes and reduces the error localization average. The second is to increase the number of packets transmitted to the next hop cluster head (CH) based on the localization algorithm. The third one is to, reduce the energy consumption of nodes and then extends the network lifetime using an efficient selection of next hop CH. The obtained simulation results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms the existing solutions in terms of energy consumption, execution time (localization time) and localization error, similarly for the number of the packets transmitted to the base station.",

Wearable devices can generate a huge amount of health data, causing big data to be one of the most prominent features. The privacy and security of big data-based MHNs are major concerns of users, and these are the overriding obstacles that stand in the way of the wider adoption of MHNs. For the sake of security, health data is encrypted and stored on an untrusted server. However, the flexibility of the data is thereby affected, such as a search over encrypted health data, or authorization control for a search and verification of the search result. To address these problems, we propose a verifiable keyword search scheme for big data-based MHNs with fine-grained authorization control. In the proposed scheme, when sending the search request to the healthcare provider for the first time, the user needs to check whether he or she has the right to search within encrypted health data. Only authorized users can generate valid trapdoors for searching. Our verification technique is constructed based on an invertible Bloom lookup table and a Merkle hash tree, which can verify the completeness and correctness of the search result even if an empty set is returned by a dishonest healthcare provider. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure against chosen keyword attacks. The proposed scheme is efficient with low computation load, which can be used to perform eyword searches and verify the search results quickly in a big data environment.",

The wireless LTCC based gas sensor consists of a planar inductor-interdigital capacitor (LC) resonant antenna, which incorporates two dimensional (2D) SnS2 nanoflakes as a model NO2 gas selective material. The fabrication of the LTCC platform is fully described, a brief description on the characterization of the gas sensitive material is presented and eventually the operation of the system for the sensing of NO2 gas is investigated. The response of the LTCC template was associated to the changes of its resistance and capacitance due to the alterations in the properties of 2D SnS2 as a result of physical adsorption of NO2 gas molecules onto its surface. The wireless gas sensing performance under different operating temperatures and NO2 gas concentrations are presented. The obtained LC gas sensor is successfully used for the wireless sensing of NO2 in the background of atmospheric gas at concentrations lower than 0.6ppm. The developed technology has a great promise for establishing wireless gas sensors for harsh environments",

Integrating intelligence and information into products themselves is possible with, among others, auto-ID technologies (barcode, RFID, …). In this paper, a new kind of intelligent product is introduced, referred to as “communicating material” paradigm. Through this paradigm, a product is (i) capable of embedding information on all or parts of the material that it is made of and (ii) capable of undergoing physical transformations without losing its communication ability and the data that is stored on it. This new material is used in our study to convey information between the different actors of the PLC, thus improving data interoperability, availability and sustainability. Although “communicating materials” provide new abilities compared to conventional products, they still have low memory capacities compared to product databases that become larger and larger. An information dissemination framework is developed in this paper to select the appropriate information to be stored on the product, at different stages of the PLC. This appropriateness is based on a degree of data relevance, which is computed by taking into account the context of use of the product (actor’s expectations, environment, …). This framework also provides the tools to split information on all or parts of the material. A case study is presented, which aims at embedding context-sensitive information on “communicating textiles”.",

Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.",

In addition, we provide a state-of-the-art survey of ULD methods and apply our taxonomy to map these methods. Mapping contributes to gap analysis for existing ULDs and also validates the applicability and accuracy of the taxonomy. Using this systematic approach, the features and characteristics of the current ULD methods are identified (i.e., equipment and algorithms). Next, the weaknesses and advantages of these methods are analyzed utilizing ten important evaluation metrics.

Moreover, since these technologies foster users' independence, Smart Homes can be both an answer to an aging workforce and a large market for an aging customer base. Nonetheless, so far market adoption has mostly been limited to the luxury segment and the more basic stand-alone technologies. Therefore, the main question driving this study is why Smart Home technology is so scarcely implemented despite its benefits to an aging population. From the literature we derive key market barriers in Smart Home value networks. We expand on these findings by means of a value network analysis of a Dutch smart home implementation case. In addition, we conducted 14 interviews that provide more insight into the value network of specific Smart Home services. Based on our case findings we develop a generic value network for Smart Homes and propose opportunities to improve market adoption of Smart Home technologies.",

Traditional cryptographic schemes such as key establishment schemes are not practical for deployment on the (resource-constrained) wearable devices, due to the limitations in their computational capabilities (e.g. limited battery life). Thus, in this study, we propose a lightweight and real-time key establishment scheme for wearable devices by leveraging the integrated accelerometer. Specifically, we introduce a novel way for users to initialize a shared key using random shakes/movements on their wearable devices. Construction of the real-time key is based on the users’ motion (e.g. walking), which does not require the data source for key construction in different devices worn by the same user to be matching. To address the known limitations on the regularity and predictability of gait, we propose a new quantization method to select data that involve noise and uncertain factors when generating secure random number. This enhances the security of the derived key. Our evaluations demonstrate that the matching rate of the shake-to-generate secret key is up to 91.00% and the corresponding generation rate is 2.027 bit/s, and devices worn on human participant’s chest, waist, wrist and carried in the participant’s pocket can generate 4.405, 4.089, 6.089 and 3.204 bits random number per second for key generation, respectively.",

Smartphones are ubiquitous and with network connectivity are perfect devices to immediately inform relevant authorities about the occurrence of an accident.

Data is continuously collected from the smartphone’s accelerometer and analyzed using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to determine the severity of the accident, reduce false positives and to notify first responders of the accident location and owner’s medical information. In addition, accidents can be viewed on the smartphone over the Internet offering instant and reliable access to the information concerning the accident. By implementing this application and adding a notification system, the response time required to notify emergency responders of traffic accidents can potentially reduce the response time which may help in reducing fatalities.",

abstract = "Although several studies have suggested activities of the fuzzy front end (FFE), they focus more on incremental innovation than to radical innovation. This study developed a creative idea generation methodology for the FFE of radical innovation from the user experience (UX) perspective, i.e., UX-driven idea generation methodology. Based on a literature review, a creative idea generation process was developed; it consists of four successive phases (Future envision, Opportunity identification and analysis, Idea generation, and Idea expansion) and one supportive phase (Ideation control). From various research fields, 70 idea generation techniques were collected and classified into phases of the process. To identify implicit and latent opportunities, the future envision method was developed based on a factor combination approach. In assessments by four experts in IT, the ideas generated by the UX-driven idea generation methodology got higher scores than brainstorming approach in novelty and relevance, but not in feasibility. The effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction was greater in the group who used the UX-driven idea generation methodology. Relevance to industry: The idea generation methodology suggested in this study can help indusial designers such as novice designers, analytical individuals as well as intuitive individuals who adhere to initial ideas. The UX-driven methodology can be used as a guideline when selecting an idea generation technique in the FFE.",

Le vieillissement de la population et l’augmentation des maladies chroniques génèrent de nouvelles problématiques en termes de parcours de soins. Ces problématiques associées au contexte économique actuel imposent un remaniement de notre système de santé pour péréniser son maintien. L’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la communication en santé (ou «e-santé»), poussée par des technologies matures et le gouvernement, est un des vecteurs d’aide à la mutation de notre système de soins. La prise en charge des pathologies cancéreuses est un domaine auquel les possibilités offertes par la e-santé s’appliquent tout particulièrement. Les prises en charge ambulatoires sont largement privilégiées avec des traitements rapidement évolutifs et complexes à la fois dans leur maniement et leurs toxicités. Ces nouvelles thérapies imposent donc un suivi de l’observance et une formation continue des professionnels de santé. Cet article propose d’exposer les fondements de l’e-santé et de la m-santé, sa composante mobile, puis de discuter leur place dans la prise en charge des pathologies cancéreuses, à la fois pour les patients et les professionnels de santé.
New information technologies and communication in health or “eHealth” is a way of improvement for management of chronic diseases. EHealth can improve patient care and care coordination especially in cancer patients who require a multidisciplinary approach. Treatments in oncology are complex and can result in new toxicities. Information of patients and of caregivers is a crucial issue. The patients require to be monitored and the caregivers need up-to-date information. The mobile component of eHealth: the mobile health or “mHealth” could provide to this need. This paper proposes to expose the principles of eHealth and its mobile component mHealth then to discuss their place in the management of cancer, for patients and caregivers.",

SIRS epidemic model is analogically introduced by measuring transition velocity of all the entities in the technology diffusion system respectively. We implement the model deterministically to forecast the potential of industrial and technological disruption in the short run, and stochastically to forecast the disruptive technology's major outbreak in candidate application areas in the long run. Radio-frequency identification technology is selected as case study. We conclude by discussing the major outbreak probabilities and potential disruptions of RFID in three different application areas.

Within the degrowth movement, some approaches criticizing the western model of development suggest original criteria that could be integrated in the design process. The current study seeks to analyze the conviviality concept of Ivan Illich (1973) to develop a new framework for designers. To that end, current design literature and four industrial case studies were analyzed according to the five main threats to conviviality: the biological degradation of the ecosystem, radical monopoly, over-programming, polarization, and obsolescence. As a result, this paper proposes a framework that includes two guidelines: one for product scope and another for the socio-technical system scope. The guidelines are composed of a set of recommendations that emerge from the relationship between the threats to conviviality and life cycle stages of a product or service. These recommendations allow designers and engineers to better approach the complexity of the design process and co-create a strong sustainable society with stakeholders.",

Quantified self and other similar movements involving wearable systems have gained recent interest. However, it is unclear what the clinical impact of these enabling technologies is on human gait. The purpose of this review is to assess clinical applications of wearable sensing and feedback for human gait and to identify areas of future research. Four electronic databases were searched to find articles employing wearable sensing or feedback for movements of the foot, ankle, shank, thigh, hip, pelvis, and trunk during gait. We retrieved 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria and identified four common clinical applications: (1) identifying movement disorders, (2) assessing surgical outcomes, (3) improving walking stability, and (4) reducing joint loading. Characteristics of knee and trunk motion were the most frequent gait parameters for both wearable sensing and wearable feedback. Most articles performed testing on healthy subjects, and the most prevalent patient populations were osteoarthritis, vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, and post-stroke hemiplegia. The most widely used wearable sensors were inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope packaged together) and goniometers. Haptic (touch) and auditory were the most common feedback sensations. This review highlights the current state of the literature and demonstrates substantial potential clinical benefits of wearable sensing and feedback. Future research should focus on wearable sensing and feedback in patient populations, in natural human environments outside the laboratory such as at home or work, and on continuous, long-term monitoring and intervention.",

To address this problem, a range of electronic pillbox devices has been developed. Although these may offer a partial solution to this problem by ameliorating the issue of failing memory, it is important to have a full picture of medication adherence that includes other aspects besides forgetfulness. This article proposes an empathetic u-pillbox system that aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing systems in ensuring adherence to a medication regime and makes an effort to design a holistic elderly healthcare framework by supporting additional functionalities like providing personalized services to the elderly based on an awareness of their individual situations by placing emphases on understanding of the elderly and provision of humanistic care. This system consists of three main processes: data acquisition of the elderly situation and medicine taking state; data analysis and elderly model enhancement; and provision of empathetic services to the elderly, in which cyber-I, human model, data cycle for the spiral quality of model enhancement, knowledge fusion towards wisdom for providing smart services are our critical concepts and techniques. This article will describe the system by going through three scenarios concerning the elderly using and interacting with the proposed u-pillbox system. Although this system is designated for geriatric healthcare, it has a potential extension to general health monitoring and care at home. Moreover, there are many potential applications in clinic or hospital medication care systems. We believe the proposed framework to be a promising approach to one of the great social challenges facing societies in the 21st century.",

The high-PSRR characteristic of the proposed BGR is achieved by adopting the technique of pre-regulator. Simulation results shows that the temperature coefficient of the proposed BGR with pre-regulator is 8.42×10−6/°C from −55 °C to 125 °C with a 1.8 V power supply voltage. The proposed BGR with pre-regulator achieves PSRR of −123.51 dB, −123.52 dB, −88.5 dB and −50.23 dB at 1 Hz, 100 Hz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz respectively.",

The design has been implemented and is evaluated against the simplistic approach of flooding the inter-connected networks with keep-alive messages.",

At the same time, new ideas to organize manufacturing process have appeared that question the absolute dominance of gain in scale. More recently, new criteria invaded the scenario of manufacturing where quality led manufacturing process to a phase based on accurate supply chain and surrounded by ubiquitous computer and robotic devices. A very precise manufacturing processes can now be designed and implemented in almost all sectors of industry, where special sub-processes can be delivered by other players. In this new scenario, a new paradigm for manufacturing design emerged, based on a set of very specialized services that could be arranged to provide new creative and sustainable processes. In this paper we go into this new paradigm for manufacturing (process) design comparing it with the classic approach that relies on layers classified as production plant, control (software oriented) and supervisory.",

abstract = "Context
As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine – Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain.
Objective
We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b) runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c) the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware.
Method
Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using appropriate experimentation.
Results
Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation selection.
Conclusion
The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be negligible depending on the domain.",

The aim of our paper is to partition locations for individual users by utilizing classification in machine learning, categorizing the location for a user once he or she makes initial check-in there. After feature extraction for each initial check-in record, we evaluate the contribution of three feature categories. The results show the contribution of different feature categories varies in classification, where social features appear to offer the least contribution. At last, we do a final test on the whole sample, comparing the results with two baselines based on majority voting respectively. The results largely outperform the baselines in general, demonstrating the effectiveness of classification.",

However, while the literature acknowledges the importance of these topics little work has addressed them from the organization's point of view. This paper investigates the challenges faced by organizational managers seeking to become more data and information-driven in order to create value. Empirical research comprised a mixed methods approach using (1) a Delphi study with practitioners through various forums and (2) interviews with business analytics managers in three case organizations. The case studies reinforced the Delphi findings and highlighted several challenge focal areas: organizations need a clear data and analytics strategy, the right people to effect a data-driven cultural change, and to consider data and information ethics when using data for competitive advantage. Further, becoming data-driven is not merely a technical issue and demands that organizations firstly organize their business analytics departments to comprise business analysts, data scientists, and IT personnel, and secondly align that business analytics capability with their business strategy in order to tackle the analytics challenge in a systemic and joined-up way. As a result, this paper presents a business analytics ecosystem for organizations that contributes to the body of scholarly knowledge by identifying key business areas and functions to address to achieve this transformation.",

We demonstrate how to deal with conflicting views when we have people with different backgrounds and geographic origins.

The challenge here lies in the fact that information privacy is a comprehensive concept with solutions being diverse, with different focus and aims. As existing taxonomies cover information security-related aspects, while neglecting privacy-specific properties, this work aims at filling this gap by describing a universal taxonomy of PETs where the taxonomy aspects are selected such that they allow the categorization of PETs in different dimensions and properties to cover a wide area of privacy (e.g., user privacy, data privacy). It provides the reader with a tool for the systematic comparison of different PETs. This helps in identifying limitations of existing PETs, complementary technologies, and potential research directions. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed taxonomy is applied to a set of key technologies covering different disciplines such as data anonymization, privacy-preserving data querying, communication protection, and identity hiding.",

abstract = "Modern manufacturing world is a super competitive place. To sustain in this environment, manufacturing organizations need a bit more of effectiveness, flexibility and innovation while manufacturing their products. This can be achieved by grasping the benefits extracted from the use of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT). Selection and evaluation of AMTs have been receiving significant attention in today's manufacturing environment as this seems to be the only way out for sustainable development. The present paper focuses on the two almost unrevealed multi-criteria approaches namely preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) and Dempster-Shafer Theory of evidence (DST) based on the basic idea of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). It also depicts a comparative study of the two for solving an AMT selection problem in a given organizational environment.",

We examine both components of the existing SGC schemes, namely the group key management and the group membership management, and discuss their performance and security level. In addition, we classify existing schemes into three different approaches: centralized, contributory, and hybrid. Additionally, we provide recommendations on which scheme to use for specific WSN constraints and specific application requirements.

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart sensors in WSN, a single localization technique that affects the overall performance is not sufficient for all applications. Thus, there have been many significant advances on localization techniques in WSNs in the past few years. The main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for localization in WSNs. Specifically, we present the recent advances on localization techniques in WSNs by considering a wide variety of factors and categorizing them in terms of data processing (centralized vs. distributed), transmission range (range free vs. range based), mobility (static vs. mobile), operating environments (indoor vs. outdoor), node density (sparse vs. dense), routing, algorithms, etc. The recent localization techniques in WSNs are also summarized in the form of tables. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of localization in sensor networks, as well as research trends and future research directions in this area.",

We then propose a mapping of this area into four quadrants – two quadrants drawing from CEP to create or extend process models and two quadrants starting from a process model to address how it can guide CEP. Existing literature is reviewed and specific challenges and opportunities are indicated for each of these quadrants. Based on this mapping, we identify challenges and opportunities that recur across quadrants and can be considered as the core issues of this combination.

A few studies have classified the functions of smart homes. Therefore, the Kano model is first adopted as a theoretical base to explore whether the functional classifications of smart homes are attractive or necessary, or both. Second, three models and test user attitudes toward three function types of smart homes are proposed. Based on the Kano model, the principal results, namely, two “Attractive Quality” and nine “Indifferent Quality” items, are found. Verification of the hypotheses also indicates that the entertainment, security, and automation functions are significantly correlated with the variables “perceive useful” and “attitude.” Cost consideration is negatively correlated with attitudes toward entertainment and automation. Results suggest that smart home providers should survey user needs for their product instead of merely producing smart homes based on the design of the builder or engineer.",

Such complexity is also amplified by the need for the real-time response on the unexpected situations detected during the transportation phase (e.g. weather conditions, strikes, accidents). In a very demanding market, request for on-time cargo delivery, transport efficiency is a critical issue, and the ability for real-time detection and resolving of all possible obstacles and exceptions becomes a core competency for logistics operators. The work presented here introduces the concept of Smart Cargo, able to autonomously react to its context, find and understand alternatives, compute adaptive behavior, optimizing its own decisions. The Smart Cargo concept, implements a paradigm shift requiring taking the control of computing applications, data, and services away from some central nodes (the “cloud”) to the other logical extreme (the “fog”) of the Internet. Fog provides an intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things, enabling Smart Cargo to go beyond the existing Intelligent Cargo concept. Fog computing is described here, as a necessary paradigm shift on distributed freight intelligence, allowing multimodal freight transport to achieve real-time situation awareness and reaction, planning with predictions and learning from the environment.",

The results were synthesized using Grounded Theory's open coding and constant comparison procedures and led to the emergence of design criteria for visualization as the central theme across all primary studies. The key categories comprising this central theme include: (a) functional criteria, which include information displayed in the visualization, modes of visualization, and visualization techniques, and (b) non-functional criteria, which include hardware and software considerations such as integrality, extensibility and portability. Together, these criteria provide clear guidelines based on research evidence for software engineers and researchers designing visualizations of energy consumption for end-users.",

In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of IURVs with different forms. Five case studies are presented of IURVs in the countries with the largest number of IURVs involving US universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of IURVs depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the IURV in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved.",

Knowledge is not an accumulation of data, but a relation-based representation of the information content, which needs to be distilled and arranged in a semantic infrastructure to guarantee interoperability and sharable understanding. In the light of this scenario, the paper introduces a semantically enhanced document retrieval system that describes each retrieved document with an ontological multi-grained network of the extracted conceptualization. The system is based on two well-known latent models: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): LSA provides a spatial distribution of the input documents, facilitating their retrieval, thanks to an ontological representation of their relationship network. LDA works instead at deeper level: it drives the ontological structuring of the knowledge inside the individual retrieved documents in terms of words, concepts and topics. The novelty of this approach is a multi-level granulation of the knowledge: from a document matching the query (coarse granularity), to the topics that join documents, until to the words describing a concept into a topic (fine granularity). The final result is a SKOS-based ontology, ad-hoc created for a document corpus; graphically supported for the navigation, it enables the exploration of the concepts at different granularity levels.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose energy efficient Information Piece Delivery (IPD) through Nano Servers (NSs) in a vehicular network. Information pieces may contain any data that needs to be communicated to a vehicle. The available power (renewable or non-renewable) for a NS is variable. As a result, the service rate of a NS varies linearly with the available energy within a given range. Our proposed system therefore exhibits energy aware rate adaptation (RA), which uses variable transmission energy. We have also developed another transmission energy saving method for comparison, where sleep cycles (SC) are employed. Both methods are compared against an acceptable download time. To reduce the operational energy, we first optimise the locations of the NSs by developing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which takes into account the hourly variation of the traffic. The model is validated through a Genetic Algorithm (GA1). Furthermore, to reduce the gross delay over the entire vehicular network, the available renewable energy (wind farm) is optimally allocated to each NS according to piece demand. This, in turn, also reduces the network carbon footprint. A Genetic Algorithm (GA2) is also developed to validate the MILP results associated with this system. Through transmission energy savings, RA and SC further reduce the NSs energy consumption by 19% and 18% respectively, however at the expense of higher download time. MILP model 4 (with RA) and model 5 (with SC) reduced the delay by 81% and 83% respectively, while minimising the carbon footprint by 96% and 98% respectively, compared to the initial MILP model.",

Impact of water droplets on a PEH are analysed after having been released from various heights to replicate a rain shower. Detailed experimental results show features which have not been published in the literature before. The results show two distinct stages in the voltage and power output; first, a log growth, then an exponential decay during an impact event. A model is also developed to characterise the output power for one unit device which is then applied to an array of rain impact harvesters. The experimental results show a power output for one unit at around 2.5 μW that is typical of the data produced in other publications. However, there is significant room for improvement as the efficiency of the system is found to be no more than 0.12% of the total kinetic energy in a typical raindrop in freefall.",

The responding sample of nurses, midwives and health visitors, all with a minimum of one years practice since completing the course totaled 145, achieving a response rate of 45%. Results. Evidence identified that practitioners were using research at a variety of levels to inform everyday practice. The skills developed in the course had transferred well to real life practice and a critical, confident, proactive approach within and across professional boundaries was demonstrated. A generally supportive culture was identified in the workplace but a lack of time and staff had prevented optimum utilisation of the new skills. A much more positive approach to research-based care was reported and many respondents stated that they had become more autonomous, accountable and better practitioners.",

Highly uniform micro cavities were easily and quickly achieved with a depth of 450μm and a bottom diameter of 600μm on a quartz substrate 500μm thick, followed by screen printing porous alumina with a position accuracy of 10μm and inkjet printing of co-metal catalyst with loading quantity resolution of 4.75ng. Compared with a bulk quartz substrate sensor, performance of the sensor fabricated by abrasive sand blasting is greatly improved with a lower thermal mass. The sensor’s temperature distribution profile is more concentrated on target catalyst, power consumption decreases to 285mW by 23%, thermal response time decreases to 8.8s by 79%, and sensitivity to methane increases to 1.83mV/% CH4 by 35%, with a high correlation coefficient up to 0.9986. Moreover, this sensor demonstrates excellent resistance to mechanical shock at high working temperatures, significantly superior to conventional silicon based membrane sensors. This design of the high performance sensor, together with the simple and fast MEMS-compatible fabrication process enables such catalytic sensors for mass production and combustible gas detecting in harsh environmental applications.",

In the first phase, the energy-constrained relay harvests energy through radio-frequency signals from the primary source. In the second phase, the destinations decode the primary signal. The relay uses the harvested energy to forward the primary signal and the secondary signal in the third phase. We derive the close-form upper bound of the ergodic capacity of the primary system and propose a relay selection algorithm. In particular, we calculate the critical region to ensure that the ergodic capacity of the primary system is equal or larger than that of the direct system. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed schemes achieve a satisfying performance.",

These complexity oriented issues make the human interaction with mobiquitous services more crucial and more challenging as compared with the classical human–computer interaction. In this paper, we propose a general framework as a conceptual tool for modeling such an interaction, once specific technologies are selected and employed. We view a single interaction occurring in a smart environment as a sequence of actions that involve users, mobiquitous services, interaction resources, environmental context items, and information exchanges between the user and the mobiquitous service. We specify these concepts and we discuss their inter-relationships. The rationale is to provide a conceptual aide for designing, analyzing and operationalizing human interaction with mobiquitous services and applications in smart environments.",

Due to the limited communication range between readers and tags, how to configure a RFID system in a large area is important but challenging. To configure a RFID system, most existing results are based on cost minimization through using 0/1 identification model. In practice, the system is interfered by environment and probabilistic model would be more reliable. To make sure the quality of the system, more objectives, such as interference and coverage, should be considered in addition to cost. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic-based multi-objective optimization model to address these challenges. The objectives to be optimized include number of readers, interference level and coverage of tags. A decomposition-based firefly algorithm is designed to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. Virtual force is integrated into random walk to guide readers moving in order to enhance exploitation. Numerical simulations are introduced to demonstrate and validate our proposed method. Comparing with existing methods, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization approaches, our proposed method can achieve better performance in terms of quality metric and generational distance under the same computational environment. However, the spacing metric of the proposed method is slightly inferior to those compared methods.",

However, one of the main issues of the existing HAR schemes is that the classification accuracy is relatively low, and in order to improve the accuracy, high computation overhead is needed. In this paper, an efficient Group-based Context-aware classification method for human activity recognition on smartphones, GCHAR is proposed, which exploits hierarchical group-based scheme to improve the classification efficiency, and reduces the classification error through context awareness rather than the intensive computation. Specifically, GCHAR designs the two-level hierarchical classification structure, i.e., inter-group and inner-group, and utilizes the previous state and transition logic (so-called context awareness) to detect the transitions among activity groups. In comparison with other popular classifiers such as RandomTree, Bagging, J48, BayesNet, KNN and Decision Table, thorough experiments on the realistic dataset (UCI HAR repository) demonstrate that GCHAR achieves the best classification accuracy, reaching 94.1636%, and time consumption in training stage of GCHAR is four times shorter than the simple Decision Table and is decreased by 72.21% in classification stage in comparison with BayesNet.",

abstract = "Background and objectives
Recent advances in miniature biomedical sensors, mobile smartphones, wireless communications, and distributed computing technologies provide promising techniques for developing mobile health systems. Such systems are capable of monitoring epileptic seizures reliably, which are classified as chronic diseases. Three challenging issues raised in this context with regard to the transformation, compression, storage, and visualization of big data, which results from a continuous recording of epileptic seizures using mobile devices.
Methods
In this paper, we address the above challenges by developing three new algorithms to process and analyze big electroencephalography data in a rigorous and efficient manner. The first algorithm is responsible for transforming the standard European Data Format (EDF) into the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and compressing the transformed JSON data to decrease the size and time through the transfer process and to increase the network transfer rate. The second algorithm focuses on collecting and storing the compressed files generated by the transformation and compression algorithm. The collection process is performed with respect to the on-the-fly technique after decompressing files. The third algorithm provides relevant real-time interaction with signal data by prospective users. It particularly features the following capabilities: visualization of single or multiple signal channels on a smartphone device and query data segments.
Results
We tested and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a software architecture model implementing a mobile health system to monitor epileptic seizures. The experimental findings from 45 experiments are promising and efficiently satisfy the approach's objectives in a price of linearity. Moreover, the size of compressed JSON files and transfer times are reduced by 10% and 20%, respectively, while the average total time is remarkably reduced by 67% through all performed experiments.
Conclusions
Our approach successfully develops efficient algorithms in terms of processing time, memory usage, and energy consumption while maintaining a high scalability of the proposed solution. Our approach efficiently supports data partitioning and parallelism relying on the MapReduce platform, which can help in monitoring and automatic detection of epileptic seizures.",

abstract = "Cloud computing offers various services to users by re-arranging storage and computing resources. In order to preserve data privacy, cloud users may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the cloud. However, processing and analyzing encrypted data are challenging problems, which have received increasing attention in recent years. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) was proposed to support computation on encrypted data and ensure data confidentiality simultaneously. However, a limitation of HE is it is a single user system, which means it only allows the party that owns a homomorphic decryption key to decrypt processed ciphertexts. Original HE cannot support multiple users to access the processed ciphertexts flexibly. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Data Processing (PPDP) system with the support of a Homomorphic Re-Encryption Scheme (HRES). The HRES extends partial HE from a single-user system to a multi-user one by offering ciphertext re-encryption to allow multiple users to access processed ciphertexts. Through the cooperation of a Data Service Provider (DSP) and an Access Control Server (ACS), the PPDP system can support seven basic operations over ciphertexts, which include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Sign Acquisition, Comparison, Equivalent Test, and Variance. To enhance the flexibility and security of our system, we further apply multiple ACSs to take in charge of the data from their own users and design computing operations over ciphertexts belonging to multiple ACSs. We then prove the security of PPDP, analyze its performance and advantages by comparing with some latest work, and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through simulations with regard to big data process.",

abstract = "Due to the outstanding advantage, such as generalization performance and fast convergence, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its variants have been widely used for many applications. The distributed ELM with MapReduce could handle large-scale training dataset efficiently, but how to cope with its updated hidden nodes number which aims to get the higher accuracy is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Distributed Extreme Learning Machine with MapReduce (A-ELM⁎). It could overcome the weakness of ELM⁎ in learning massive training dataset for updating hidden nodes number. Firstly, we found that through partial adjustment of incremental hidden nodes and decremental hidden nodes, matrix multiplication (the most computation-expensive part in A-ELM⁎) can be calculated. Next, A-ELM⁎ based on MapReduce framework is proposed. A-ELM⁎ first calculates the intermediate matrix multiplications of the updated hidden nodes subset, and then update the matrix multiplications by modifying the old matrix multiplications with the intermediate ones. Then, based on the updated matrix multiplications, there could obtain the corresponding new output weight vector with centralized computing. Therefore, it is effective for learning large scale training dataset, in which the hidden nodes update rapidly. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed A-ELM⁎, using synthetic data with extensive experiments, in learning updated hidden nodes.",

abstract = "Globally, most governments have devoted resources to information and communication technology (ICT) development. Their goal is to improve teaching and learning using innovative technology in institutions of learning. This has brought about the formulation of educational ICT policies. These policies are aimed at guiding the implementation processes in schools. Namibia adopted the National ICT policy for Education in 2005 and the National ICT Policy Implementation Plan in 2006. Based on information, since the adoption of the policy, no study has been done to evaluate the implementation process, thereby making it difficult to ascertain the readiness of teachers and learners towards the adoption of these technologies of which mobile learning technology is one of them. This study analyses the perception of teachers and learners towards the adoption of mobile learning in Namibian high schools. The research is a mixed method study, undertaking surveys and interviews with learners and teachers from three schools in the Khomas region. The study uses the UTAUT as a guiding model to analyse teacher and learner perceptions towards mobile learning. Data collected after survey were analyzed using SPSS and excel tools, and then percentage analysis was done to find the key contributors towards to adoption of mobile learning in Namibian high schools. The findings were that the majority of teachers and learners in Namibian high schools are mobile ICT literate. Most of teachers and learners own handheld mobile devices, can access the internet, download education material and applications from the internet using mobile devices, use mobile devices as calculators, access social networking sites, search for definitions of words on mobile, send emails, conduct searches for material, read assignments and post comments on blogs. Both teachers and learners were positive that mobile technology would enhance their teaching and learning capabilities, assist in improving learner grades and accomplish teaching and learning activities quickly. Although learners were positive that mobile education should be made compulsory in schools, they feel that the decision lies with policy makers on whether schools should adopt it. Both learners and teachers feel that Namibia has the resources in place to introduce mobile learning without any glitches. These resources are in the form of infrastructure and human resources.",

We will show that it is a very cost-effective way to build refuges, and viable solutions exist for various budgets and timeframes. Nuclear submarines are surface independent, and could provide energy, oxygen, fresh water and perhaps even food for their inhabitants for years. They are able to withstand close nuclear explosions and radiation. They are able to maintain isolation from biological attacks and most known weapons. They already exist and need only small adaptation to be used as refuges. But building refuges is only “Plan B” of existential risk preparation; it is better to eliminate such risks than try to survive them.",

However, before virtual environments are able to replace the traditional environments the differences between the methods must be worked out. We take up on previous studies which compared different real and virtual environments concerning presence and usability and expand the research on the factor of user experience. We compared a virtual field environment (CAVE – Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) and a real field environment (city center of Chemnitz, Germany) in a between-subject-design concerning presence, and evaluate its impact on the usability and the user experience of a geocaching game. The data of 60 participants was analyzed and shows significantly higher ecological validity for the real field environment but higher values for engagement and negative effects in the virtual field environment. Concerning usability, significant differences were verified between the two environments. All presence factors correlated significantly with usability in the CAVE, but did not correlate in the real-field environment. Concerning user experience, the CAVE showed significantly higher hedonic quality values, whereas the real field environment had higher pragmatic quality values. In both conditions presence and user experience factors were partly correlated. Our results indicate that virtual environments can be an alternative to real environments for user experience studies, when a high presence is achieved.",

Hadoop provides a highly feasible solution for building big data analytics platforms. However, defects of Hadoop are also exposed in many aspects including data management, resource management, scheduling policies, etc. These issues usually cause high energy consumption when running MapReduce jobs in Hadoop clusters. In this paper, we review the studies on improving energy efficiency of Hadoop clusters and summarize them in five categories including the energy-aware cluster node management, energy-aware data management, energy-aware resource allocation, energy-aware task scheduling and other energy-saving schemes. For each category, we briefly illustrate its rationale and comparatively analyze the relevant works regarding their advantages and limitations. Moreover, we present our insights and figure out possible research directions including energy-efficient cluster partitioning, data-oriented resource classification and provisioning, resource provisioning based on optimal utilization, EE and locality aware task scheduling, optimizing job profiling with machine learning, elastic power-saving Hadoop with containerization and efficient big data analytics on Hadoop. On one hand, the summary of studies on energy-efficient Hadoop presented in this paper provides useful guidance for the developers and users to better utilize Hadoop. On the other hand, the insights and research trends discussed in this work may inspire the relevant research on improving the energy efficiency of Hadoop in big data analytics.",

However, the layout of LEDs will lead to the uneven distribution of the received optical power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the same receiving plane, which cannot guarantee fairness of communication. To solve this problem, we used an LED source array and introduced a power adjustment factor to determine a set of optimal power regulators to improve the power distribution on the same receiving plane. We proposed an improved cuckoo search (ICS) algorithm based on chaos theory and dimension cells to solve the normal CS algorithm convergence problem. The chaos mechanism will optimize the random distribution of the initial solution for chaotic distribution, and it can achieve an improved quality of the initial solutions. Moreover, we divided the multidimensional solutions into several dimension cells to avoid interference between dimensions. Simulation results show that the accuracy and the convergence rate of the ICS algorithm is better than that of CS, particle swarm optimization, and evolutionary algorithm. Furthermore, the fairness of the received optical power and SNR on the same receiving plane can be clearly improved.",

However, lots of factors in the ever-changing environment of manufacturing industry, such as, various of complex production processes, larger scale and uncertainties, more complicated constrains, coupling of operational performance, and so on, make production management face with more and more big challenges. The dynamic inflow of a large number of raw data which is collected from the physical manufacturing sites or generated in various related information systems, caused the heavy information overload problems. Indeed, most of traditional DMTs are not yet sufficient to process such big data for smart production management. Therefore, this paper reviews the development of DMTs in the big data era, and makes discussion on the applications of DMTs in production management, by selecting and analyzing the relevant papers since 2010. In the meantime, we point out limitations and put forward some suggestions about the smartness and further applications of DMTs used in production management.",

In this article, we propose a group of fusion-based result diversification methods with the aim to improve performance that considers both relevance and diversity. They are linear combinations of scores that are obtained from different component search systems. The weight of each search system is determined by considering three factors: performance, dissimilarity, and complementarity. There are two major contributions. Firstly, we find that all the three factors of performance and complementarity and dissimilarity are useful for effective weighting of linear combination. Secondly, we present the logarithmic function-based model for converting ranking information into scores. Experiments are carried out with four groups of results submitted to the TREC web diversity task. Experimental results show that some of the fusion methods that use the aforementioned techniques perform more effectively than the state-of-the-art fusion methods for result diversification.",

abstract = "Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.",

abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

Finally, experimental results for several examples and UCI data sets show the connections and differences between BCKCR–AIM and other attribute importance measures. The advantage of our measure is that it uses attributes set changes to describe knowledge change and associated features between lower and upper approximations of decision classes and knowledge to reflect attribute importance. Our measure can improve feasibility and interpretability; therefore, BCKCR–AIM has wide application in such approaches as attributes reduction, feature extraction, information fusion, and expert systems.",

abstract = "The Indian IT services sector has grown from small beginnings at the bottom of value creation to a major player in the global information and communications technology (ICT) industry. It commands a 55% share in the global market for IT services. India's IT sector value proposition in terms of low cost with large supply of high quality talent is compelling. As a result, India has become the premier choice not only for outsourcing IT services by the developed-world's multinational corporations (MNCs) but also for locating their own Global In-house Centers (GICs), which simultaneously compete and partner with local firms. This gave rise to six additional clusters beyond the earliest, largest and robust cluster, Bangalore. The paper provides a review of relevant literature; develops a conceptual framework for evaluation of clusters; and presents data and analysis with respect to relative size, growth, specialization, MNC presence and connectivity to local firms through expatriates and returning Indians, ,innovation; and discusses adequacy of ICT infrastructure for future growth. Although there are clear signs that the Indian IT sector has been moving towards a regime of providing high-end value added services, the sector's value proposition – lower cost combined with a large supply of high quality talent – remains the single most compelling reason for the rise and growth of multiple export clusters. Thus the sector's growth appears to be a case of growth by replication rather than innovation. The paper concludes that the Indian IT sector's value proposition in terms of lower cost combined with large supply of high quality talent remains the single most compelling reason for the rise and growth of multiple IT services export clusters. While the old adage, “people follow jobs” still holds for large part of the labor force, there is little doubt that the sprawling IT services clusters in India - with more to come from Tier II and Tier III cities – indicate, in fact, that “jobs follow talent." Both local firms and the MNCs, through their GICs, are pushing the boundaries of location farther and farther to continue to leverage cost advantage and available pools of talent.",

In this study, we deal with the problem of forecasting with missing data in smart grid and BEMS applications, where the information from home area sensors and/or smart meters is sometimes missing, which may hinder or even prevent the forecasting of the next hours and days. In concrete, we focus in a Soft Computing technique called Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR) and its improved version that can cope with missing information in the forecasting process: flexible FIR. In this article eight different strategies for flexible FIR forecasting are defined and studied taking into account: causal relevance of input variables, consistency of predictions, inertia criterion and K-Nearest Neighbours. Furthermore, we evaluate the implications of prediction accuracy and number of predictions, when the number of Missing Values (MVs) in the training dataset is increased progressively. To this end, a real smart grid forecasting application, i.e. electricity load forecasting, has been chosen in this study. The results show that all eight strategies proposed are able to cope with MVs and take advantage of the inherent information in the data, with better results in those strategies making use of causal relevance. In addition, the robustness of flexible FIR and its eight strategies are proved taking into account that the percentage of electricity load predictions from the test dataset is on average 96.15% when the %MVs in training dataset was around 73%.",

The lack of a clear set of defining characteristics for the construct of successful aging has made comparison of findings across studies difficult and has limited advances in aging research. A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.",

Earlier research has focused on the organisational preconditions for disruptive innovation to arise. Much less attention has been paid to the role of innovation processes, including their goals and design, in promoting disruptive innovation. In this paper we aim to begin to fill this gap by better understanding how new innovation processes can act as antecedents for disruptive innovation. We adopt an inductive theory-building methodology using a set of case studies of Chinese firms to develop propositions about how novel R&D and production processes can foster disruptive innovation. We find that in the case of China the adoption of new innovation processes that re-define the focus of innovation and re-engineer traditional R&D processes in ways that allow the novel deployment of Chinese cost advantages can create offerings that incorporate the key elements of disruptive innovation in the sense that they challenge incumbents׳ established business models. Realising disruptive innovation opportunities requires proactive initiatives. We conclude by discussing the managerial implications and possible responses as well as directions for future research.",

abstract = "In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one’s knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.",

We describe our personal practice in the care of the dying child. There is no on right model of care, and the multidisciplinary team must be sensitive to individual needs. It is important to get the balance of palliation and active treatment right (important at all stages of the illness). Key is careful planning by the whole multidisciplinary team and unhurried and frequent communication with the parents by a few key people. It is important to keep re-checking levels of understanding of the family; at times of stress, little information may be retained. Care should extend to the wider family and friends, and it is important also to consider the needs of hospital staff, both the immediate core team and beyond. Respect for religious and cultural issues is essential, but should not be allowed to interfere with optimum treatment of the child. The validity of different patterns of grieving should be acknowledged. Regular review is essential. There need to be open discussions about capping care, so that only appropriate interventions are given. This may be more difficult if the dying child is awaiting transplantation. The place of death (home, hospice, hospital) will be a matter of individual choice. After the death of the child, we offer follow up care for both the family and the staff.",

An insecure communication channel between a tag and a reader makes the RFID implant system vulnerable to attacks and endangers the user's safety and privacy. The proposed scheme relies on elliptic curve cryptography and the D-Quark lightweight hash design. Compared to the available public-key cryptosystems, elliptic curve-based cryptosystems are the best choice due to their small key sizes as well as their efficiency in computations. The D-Quark lightweight hash design is tailored for resource constrained pervasive devices, cost, and performance. The security analysis of the proposed authentication scheme revealed that it is secure against the relevant threat models and provides a higher security level than related work found in the literature. The computational performance comparison shows that our work has 48% less communication overhead compared to existing similar schemes. It also requires 24% less total memory than the other approaches. The required computational time of our scheme is generally similar to other existing schemes. Hence, the presented scheme is a well-suited choice for providing security for the resource-constrained RFID implant systems.",

abstract = "The design of sustainable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a very challenging issue. On the one hand, energy-constrained sensors are expected to run autonomously for long periods. However, it may be cost-prohibitive to replace exhausted batteries or even impossible in hostile environments. On the other hand, unlike other networks, WSNs are designed for specific applications which range from small-size healthcare surveillance systems to large-scale environmental monitoring. Thus, any WSN deployment has to satisfy a set of requirements that differs from one application to another. In this context, a host of research work has been conducted in order to propose a wide range of solutions to the energy-saving problem. This research covers several areas going from physical layer optimisation to network layer solutions. Therefore, it is not easy for the WSN designer to select the efficient solutions that should be considered in the design of application-specific WSN architecture. We present a top-down survey of the trade-offs between application requirements and lifetime extension that arise when designing wireless sensor networks. We first identify the main categories of applications and their specific requirements. Then we present a new classification of energy-conservation schemes found in the recent literature, followed by a systematic discussion as to how these schemes conflict with the specific requirements. Finally, we survey the techniques applied in WSNs to achieve trade-off between multiple requirements, such as multi-objective optimisation.",

abstract = "Today’s largest and fastest growing companies’ assets are no longer physical, but rather digital (software, algorithms...). This is all the more true in the manufacturing, and particularly in the maintenance sector where quality of enterprise maintenance services are closely linked to the quality of maintenance data reporting procedures. If quality of the reported data is too low, it can results in wrong decision-making and loss of money. Furthermore, various maintenance experts are involved and directly concerned about the quality of enterprises’ daily maintenance data reporting (e.g., maintenance planners, plant managers...), each one having specific needs and responsibilities. To address this Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, and since data quality is hardly considered in existing expert maintenance systems, this paper develops a maintenance reporting quality assessment (MRQA) dashboard that enables any company stakeholder to easily – and in real-time – assess/rank company branch offices in terms of maintenance reporting quality. From a theoretical standpoint, AHP is used to integrate various data quality dimensions as well as expert preferences. A use case describes how the proposed MRQA dashboard is being used by a Finnish multinational equipment manufacturer to assess and enhance reporting practices in a specific or a group of branch offices.",

Topology control is an important technique for reducing energy consumption, interference, and maintaining connectivity in the network. This paper provides a survey on state scheduling-based topology control techniques for unattended wireless sensor networks. Topology control algorithms for both flat and hierarchical networks are discussed. The algorithms are further categorized according to the key parameters used for state scheduling. The advantages, disadvantages, and results of the algorithms are tabulated. In addition, we highlight future research directions in designing state scheduling-based topology control algorithms.",

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 – What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 – What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline.",

In this paper, we provide an in depth review of rare event detection from an imbalanced learning perspective. Five hundred and seventeen related papers that have been published in the past decade were collected for the study. The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields.",

Based on a national survey of American adults, this paper explores this question through considering both barriers to Internet use and the possibilities the Internet offers PWD. Findings indicate barriers for many PWD to accessing the Internet. Those with five of six types of disabilities measured are considerably less likely to be online than those who are not disabled. People who are deaf or hearing impaired to do not lag in Internet access once we account for demographics, Web use skills, and Internet experiences. However, the study also finds evidence that once online, PWD engage in a range of uses of the Internet as much as people without disability. Moreover, PWD take distinct interest in certain online activities, such as sharing their own content and reviewing products and services, pointing to ways they may go online to adapt and respond to the wider inaccessible society. These findings indicate great potential for the Internet for people with disabilities and suggest that moving more of them online holds the potential for considerable gains among this group.",

In this paper, a simple and efficient inverse consistent image transformation estimation algorithm is proposed to preserve correspondence of landmarks and accelerate convergence. The proposed algorithm estimates both the forward and backward transformations simultaneously in the way that they are inverse to each other based on the correspondence of landmarks. Instead of computing the inverse functions and the inverse consistent transformations, respectively, we combine them together, which can improve computation efficiency significantly. Moreover, radial basis functions (RBFs) based transformation is adopted in our algorithm, which can handle deformation with local or global support. Our algorithm maps one landmark to its corresponding position exactly using the forward and backward transformations. Moreover, our algorithm is employed to estimate the forward and backward transformations in robust point matching, as well to demonstrate the application of our algorithm in image registration. The experiment results of uniform grids and test images indicate the improvement of the proposed algorithm in the aspect of inverse consistency of transformations and the reduction of the computation time of the forward and the backward transformations. The performance of our algorithm applying to robust point matching is evaluated using both brain slices and lung slices. Our experiments show that by combing robust point matching with our algorithm, the registration accuracy can be improved and the smoothness of transformations can be preserved.",

The following are fundamental limitations of machine intelligence: (1) machines know few links and rules in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space, so it is not realistic to expect machines to discover laws and solve problems in these spaces; and, (2) machines can only process pre-designed algorithms and data structures in the cyber space. They are limited in ability to go beyond the cyber space, to learn linking rules, to know the effect of linking, and to explain computing results according to physical, physiological, psychological and socio laws. Linking various spaces will create a complex space — the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME. Diverse spaces will emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence. From multi-disciplinary perspective, this paper reviews previous ideas on various links, introduces the concept of cyber-physical society, proposes the ideal of the CP3SME including its definition, characteristics, and multi-disciplinary revolution, and explores the methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence. The methodology includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation. The CP3SME aims at an ideal environment for humans to live and work. Exploration will go beyond previous ideals on intelligence and computing.",

While many therapists learn how to implement exposure techniques through clinical training programs or instructional workshops, not all of these educational efforts include a focus on the theory underlying this treatment. The availability of treatment manuals providing step-by-step instructions for how to implement exposure makes it easier for clinicians to use these techniques with less training than they might otherwise receive. This raises questions regarding whether it is necessary to understand the theory behind the use of exposure. This article argues that knowledge of the relevant theory is crucial to being able to implement exposure therapy in ways that optimize both short- and long-term outcome. Specific ways in which theory is relevant to using exposure techniques are discussed.",

abstract = "Background
Present day control and monitoring systems are equipped with a large number of heterogeneous devices and are operated by many users with different roles and responsibilities. The information generated by these devices, although preprocessed and filtered, is usually delivered to users regardless of their actual information needs, thus overwhelming cognitive capacities and potentially affecting safety of the system.
Objectives
This work aims to reduce information load to the users of the data-intensive monitoring systems by delivering selected information to each user based on his/her roles in the system and responsibilities.
Methods
The proposed approach combines Semantic Web (SW) technologies and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for configuration purposes and run-time analyzing. The approach is exemplified with implemented tools and feasibility study based on the performance tests. The paper describes principles of proposed approach, demonstrates illustrative scenarios from building automation domain, gives description of implemented tools, and presents results of the initial performance tests.
Results
The combination of SW and CEP brings two major advantages: (1) the behavior of the system could be easily changed by configuring only underlying ontology and (2) utilization of CEP at runtime makes system event-driven and reactive to frequent changes in the environment. The performance tests demonstrated the response time of implemented tools within one second for 1000 updates per second (which corresponded to 10,000 devices in the performed experiments).
Conclusions
It is expected that the proposed approach is able to make monitoring systems personal oriented and thus safer during the operation. The results of the performance tests suggest feasibility of the approach for such systems as building and home automation, and non-critical industrial automation.",

In particular, two paths of the direct effects on perceived benefits and risks that induce the ultimate intention to disclose personal information via mobile apps were proposed and empirically tested. The analysis showed that self-presentation and personalized services positively influence consumers’ perceived benefits, which in turn positively affects the intention to disclose personal information. Perceived severity and perceived control serve as the direct antecedents of perceived risks that negatively affect the intention of consumers to disclose personal information. Compared with the perceived risks, the perceived benefits more strongly influence the intention to disclose personal information. This study extends the literature on privacy concerns to consumer intention to disclose personal information by theoretically developing and empirically testing four hypotheses in a research model. Results were validated in the mobile context, and implications and discussions were presented.",

The newly detected abnormal symptoms can be further sent to the cloud server for high-accuracy prediction in a privacy-preserving way. Specifically, for the fog servers, we design a new secure outsourced inner-product protocol for achieving secure lightweight single-layer neural network. Also, a privacy-preserving piecewise polynomial calculation protocol allows cloud server to securely perform any activation functions in multiple-layer neural network. Moreover, to solve the computation overflow problem, a new protocol called privacy-preserving fraction approximation protocol is designed. We then prove that the HPCS achieves the goal of patient health status monitoring without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties by balancing real-time and high-accurate prediction using simulations.",

Starting from 2006, a comprehensive regulation of the information issues in Russia began to emerge, having immediate practical effect not only on national parties, but also – due to developments in approaches to jurisdiction – to parties acting in digital environment internationally. The purpose of the research is to consider ‘narrow’ approach to the legal definition of personal data (as the trigger of personal data legislation) in the regulatory environment of the Russian Federation in the context of regulation of informational and telecommunication technologies with a particular focus on ‘Big Data’. The problem considered implies the balance between the principle of formal certainty of legal norms, on the one hand, and technological developments, on the other. The formal definition of personal data shall be interpreted uniformly to ensure consistent and predictable application of law which appears not reliably possible at the moment, although the Russian definition of personal data corresponds to the CETS Convention No. 108 which Russia is a party to. As the analysis of the Russian court practice shows, the courts are applying the broad definition interpreting it as if it has at least two additional criteria: that a set of data should be enough to identify an individual and that only a set of data in possession of a particular operator should be considered. It is suggested that these criteria find reflection in “surgical” amendments to the legislation, and the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act, 1998 can serve as a source of adoption in terms of comparative law. Furthermore, the article discusses whether the ‘narrow’ approach may be viewed as contributing to privacy protection in the age of Big Data, rather than lowering barriers of privacy. The authors explain that the ‘narrow’ approach may be considered positive in this aspect because it allows keeping the existing general privacy regulation workable in a reasonably predictable manner. Besides, the research may serve as an introductory material into the Russian data protection legislation.",

According to this VCRO, there are no extra elements; instead, the control behavior is included in the delay element itself. The presented VCRO is analyzed quantitatively with the expressions of the oscillation frequency in terms of the control voltage and the average power consumption derived. The presented VCRO has a good linearity over the full range from 0V to the power-supply voltage and doesn’t suffer from the need to turn on the MOS transistor. The effects of the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations and the technology scaling on the performance of this VCRO are also investigated. The performance of the presented VCRO is compared with that of other schemes by simulation adopting the Berkeley predictive technology model (BPTM) of the 45nm CMOS technology with a power-supply voltage, VDD, equal to 1V.",

While recommendation plays an increasingly critical role in our living, study, work, and entertainment, the recommendations we receive are often for irrelevant, duplicate, or uninteresting products and services. A critical reason for such bad recommendations lies in the intrinsic assumption that recommended users and items are independent and identically distributed (IID) in existing theories and systems. Another phenomenon is that, while tremendous efforts have been made to model specific aspects of users or items, the overall user and item characteristics and their non-IIDness have been overlooked. In this paper, the non-IID nature and characteristics of recommendation are discussed, followed by the non-IID theoretical framework in order to build a deep and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic nature of recommendation problems, from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. This non-IID recommendation research triggers the paradigm shift from IID to non-IID recommendation research and can hopefully deliver informed, relevant, personalized, and actionable recommendations. It creates exciting new directions and fundamental solutions to address various complexities including cold-start, sparse data-based, cross-domain, group-based, and shilling attack-related issues.",

It does not only provide raw material and food, but also provides large employment opportunities. Therefore, agriculture requires modern technology for increasing the productivity. In this context, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) could be utilized for monitoring the climatic parameters such as (temperature, humidity, light, carbon dioxide, soil moisture, acidity etc.) in an agriculture field. The climatic parameters are very important in terms of growth, quality and productivity of crops. But, any kind of interception, modification, insertion, and deletion on these parameters can have negative effect on crop. Therefore, security and privacy are important issues in agriculture field. In this regard, we design a novel remote user authentication scheme using wireless sensor networks for agriculture monitoring. The protocol is validated through Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and also simulated using Automated Validation Information Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. We formally analyze the security of the scheme using random oracle model. In addition, the informal security analysis shows that the proposed protocol is secure and resists various kinds of malicious attacks.

abstract = "Information technology-based methods, such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), play an important role in industrial transformation and evolution. However, while significant efforts have been made towards CPS application in several other industry sectors, the exploration of CPS benefits and applicability to the construction industry is at the initial stage. While CPS has been identified as a promising solution to address problems in the construction industry, few explorations have been made on CPS application to temporary structures, which have significant safety issues that urgently need to be addressed. With a focus on the enhanced monitoring of temporary structures to prevent potential structural failures, this study proposed a CPS-based temporary structures monitoring (TSM) system that integrates the virtual model of a temporary structure and the physical structure on the construction jobsite. In doing this, the applicability of CPS to temporary structures monitoring is investigated, and end user requirements and system requirements are identified for system design. In addition, a system architecture and a description of the issues surrounding the choice of a system development environment are presented. For better understanding of how the TSM works, aspects of the developed CPS-based TSM are presented with system workflow and simulated examples of the structural monitoring of a scaffolding system. The potential benefits and barriers to CPS implementation in temporary structures, along with future research based on this study, are highlighted.",

By sensing the spectrum, wireless devices sense their radio environment and perform spectrum access accordingly to reduce collisions.

Cooperative sensing is seen as a way to improve the performance of wireless devices improving the radio bandwidth utilization and minimizing interference among wireless devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which provides protocols for cooperative sensing and presents experimental results with IEEE 802.15.4 devices. We present and implement protocols and applications for primary, secondary and cooperative users with a dedicated control channel. Thereby, the secondary user receiver serves as a first cooperative node in the system which reduces collisions between primary and secondary users. We evaluate the system performance with receiver sensing and additional cooperative nodes. We also propose a mechanism to extend the protocol for multiple secondary users sharing the same control channel. Based on the evaluations, we also provide recommendations for usage of cooperative sensing with focus on IEEE 802.15.4.",

abstract = "Utility regulation in the United States (US) was founded partly on a consensus that raw marketplace economics ignored social justice, including universal service goals. The century-old ‘regulatory compact’ in most jurisdictions offers ‘just and reasonable rates’ in exchange for investment in public services. Justice has come to justify such low-income supports as discounted rates, arrearage forgiveness, limitations on service termination, and low/no cost energy efficiency. The consensus for regulation has now evolved to encompass carbon reduction, and has led to, amongst other things, the promotion of domestic forms of renewable energy known as ‘distributed generation’ (DG). However, such technologies potentially threaten the current regulatory balance that includes ameliorating energy poverty, because DG reduces utility sales but not utility fixed costs and so contributes to higher bills for low-income households that cannot afford such DG investments as rooftop solar, solar domestic hot water, and cogeneration. The aim of this paper is to analyze how utility regulation might evolve to encompass modern energy developments, thus addressing both the goals of reducing carbon and amerliorating fuel poverty. It begins by reviewing the origin of US utility regulation and describes the regulatory compact that resulted. It then discusses possible balancing measures, including tax-based subsidies, system benefit charges (taxes) on DG, stricter application of just and reasonable regulatory principles, and low-income-specific approaches to DG.",

In this paper, a three layered big data analytic architecture is designed to analyze the data generated during the construction of the barrier and detection of the intruder using camera sensors. Besides, a cloud layer is designed for storing the analyzed data to study the behavior of the intruder. In order to minimize the number of camera sensors for constructing the barrier, algorithms are designed to construct the single barrier with limited node mobility and the barrier path Quality of Sensing (QoS) is maintained with a minimum number of camera sensors. Simulation results show that our algorithms can construct 100% of the barrier with fewer number of camera sensors and average data processing time can be reduced by using parallel servers even if for larger size of data.",

Drawing on concepts from the sociology of chronic illness, analyses suggest that the biographical and social context relevant to individuals’ experience of living with a long-term condition, history of health service utilisation, and relationships with health professionals are relevant to understanding the impact of self-management education and related policies aimed at bringing about changes in service use.

Four different geometries of transducer have been evaluated by two different measurement techniques. Devices were fabricated by etching planar gold electrodes on low-cost glass-fibre substrates (FR-4) using a standard printed circuit board (PCB) photolithography, wet etching and electroless plating method. Thin films of the P-type semiconducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT-PSS, were cast onto the electrodes by spin-coating. The conducting polymer films were electrically characterised by measuring the film resistance from the underlying gold electrodes using a digital multimeter, and also by determination of the film's current–voltage transfer characteristic (I–V curve) measured with a precision laboratory 4-point probe instrument. This allowed the relative contribution of the contact resistance at the Au/PEDOT-PSS interface to be determined as a proportion of the overall measured resistance. Contact resistance is known to affect the analytical performance of chemiresistor type devices, so in this work the combined effects of electrode geometry, polymer film composition and ageing of the film on bulk film and contact resistances have been investigated. The applicability of the chemiresistor transducers for chemical sensing is demonstrated using a PEDOT-PSS thin film as an ethanol vapour sensitive coating in a simple vapour exposure test, where a reversible conductometric response was observed. Due to the simplicity, low-cost and ultra low-power requirements of these transducers, they may be particularly suited to battery powered mobile and wireless sensing applications, or to applications dependant upon energy harvesting.",

An offer network is an architecture for a future economic system based on the matching of offers and demands without the intermediate of money. Intelligence requires a network of condition-action rules, where conditions represent challenges that elicit action in order to solve a problem or exploit an opportunity. In society, opportunities correspond to offers of goods or services, problems to demands. Tackling challenges means finding the best sequences of condition-action rules to connect all demands to the offers that can satisfy them. This can be achieved with the help of AI algorithms working on a public database of rules, demands and offers. Such a system would provide a universal medium for voluntary collaboration and economic exchange, efficiently coordinating the activities of all people on Earth. It would replace and subsume the patchwork of commercial and community-run sharing platforms presently running on the Internet. It can in principle resolve the traditional problems of the capitalist economy: poverty, inequality, externalities, poor sustainability and resilience, booms and busts, and the neglect of non-monetizable values.",

This paper considers the scenario of a cloud service market where several Cloud Service Providers (CSP) are in operation and are competing against each other to attract and serve the demands generated by the customers. The competition arises from the fact that the customers (the individuals or organizations) who generate demand for services in the market rationally choose the CSP which offers good quality of services at a lower price. For pricing the services offered by the CSPs under this framework, we provide an analytical framework by considering the operational cost incurred by the CSP to service the given demand, the quality of service (QoS) offered and the prices other CSPs are charging. The pricing strategy we propose strikes a reasonable balance between charging too little which would result in irrationally low business profit and charging too much which would result in customer loss and thereby eventually loss of market share. In addition, the pricing strategy proposed promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy integration using a bi-level optimization strategy. The first level consisting of a Slow Timescale Optimization Procedure (STOP) addresses the economic efficiency related issues for cloud service pricing. The second level involving a Fast Timescale Optimization Procedure (FTOP) performs energy efficient job scheduling. We carry out numerical simulations to validate the proposed pricing strategy and compare it with an oracle benchmark policy, with fair profit sharing among the CSPs. We compare the proposed energy aware scheduling policy with a baseline scheduling policy. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed bi-level strategy and discuss the results.",

Thus, there is a need for sophisticated fine-grained access control mechanisms to cater these access demands and thereby experience the full potential of e-health systems. In order to realize a flexible access control scheme, integrating access delegation is of paramount importance. However, access delegation has to be enforced in a controlled manner so that it will not jeopardize the security of the system. In this paper, we addressed this issue through proposing an attribute based access control scheme integrated with controlled access delegation capabilities. We demonstrate how the proposed scheme could function by considering a health information sharing scenario which constitutes a collaborative environment. The proposed scheme capable of provisioning multi-level access delegation with each delegating user having the capability of controlling further delegations by the delegatee. In addition, the scheme is also integrated with a mechanism to limit the total number of delegations allowable for a given attribute to accommodate for inappropriate user behaviors. Thus, users can claim access to resources by providing a proof that they possess attribute sets (attributes may or may not be delegated) that satisfy the relevant attribute based access policies which govern the access to the shared resources. The proposed scheme is also equipped with on-demand attribute revocation mechanism along with preventing attacks via attribute collusion. Furthermore, we have shown that the proposed access control scheme is secure and also exhibits superior delegation capabilities compared to the existing attribute based schemes coupled with access delegation capabilities.",

For such systems to become a reality, however, advances must be made in high performance computing (HPC), large-scale distributed systems, and big data solutions, also tackling challenges such as improving the energy efficiency of the IT infrastructure. Monitoring the power consumed by underlying IT resources is essential towards optimising the manner IT resources are used and hence improve the sustainability of such systems. Nevertheless, monitoring the energy consumed by USSs is a challenging endeavour as the system can comprise thousands of heterogeneous server resources spanning multiple data centres. Moreover, the amount of monitoring data, its gathering, and processing, should never become a bottleneck nor profoundly impact the energy efficiency of the overall system. This work surveys state of the art on energy monitoring of large-scale systems and methodologies for monitoring the power consumed by large systems and discusses some of the challenges to be addressed towards monitoring and improving the energy efficiency of USSs.

This paper proposes a novel CEP engine conceived with ease of use, extensibility, portability, and scalability requirements in mind. More specifically, we propose a Lightweight Stage-based Event Processor (LiSEP) based on a layered architectural design. Thanks to the adoption of Staged Event-Driven Architecture principles, core event processing logic is decoupled from low-level thread management issues.

In this study, we propose and design a low-cost and widely deployable strategy for empowering emergency rescuers through an intelligent mobile psychological self-help tool. This tool will help reduce the gap between the limited number of qualified professional counsellors and the high demand for timely psychological support by rescuers. We start with a thorough investigation of user requirements, extant work, and relevant IS design theories to inform our system design choices, among which we identified that “virtual advisor identity” (VAI) needs further research. We then empirically examined how VAI influences the empowerment effect of ERMS. Involving 120 emergency rescuers who have just finished rescue tasks, our experiment shows that VAI has important effects on a user’s cognitive and emotional routes, which are significant empowering enablers that lead to positive empowerment outcomes. Interestingly, virtual peer advisor empowers users mostly through evoking emotional resonance from them, whereas virtual expert advisor is better at empowering users through cognitive channels. Important theoretical and practical implications of the findings are then discussed.",

Acquiring external knowledge from service suppliers can be a way to tackle this problem. The objective of this study is to understand how manufacturing companies aiming at a servitization-driven business model innovation (BMI) integrate such knowledge from service suppliers. We focus on different types of collaboration that can occur and on the knowledge sharing (KS) dynamics of this collaboration. We employ a multiple-case study approach to analyze nine BMI processes from companies that transformed their traditional business model (BM) to a servitized BM. As a result, we obtain a theoretical framework that presents six possible KS dynamics for the servitization design by originally combining two main approaches for servitization-driven BMI (i.e. product-oriented and service-oriented product-service systems) and three main configurations of relationships with service suppliers based on traditional new product development classifications of buyer-supplier integration (i.e. white, grey and black box configurations). Implications of combining a BMI and a buyer-supplier KS perspectives to investigate the process of servitization for manufacturing companies are then discussed.",

Applications such as location-based services and quantified self harness such data to bring meaningful context to users’ behavior. As social applications are becoming prevalent, there is a trend for users to share their mobile data. The nature of online social networking poses new challenges for controlling access to private data, as compared to traditional enterprise systems. First, the user may have a large number of friends, each associated with a unique access policy. Second, the access control policies must be dynamic and fine-grained, i.e. they are content-based, as opposed to all-or-nothing. In this paper, we investigate the challenges in sharing of mobile data in social applications. We design and evaluate a middleware running on Google App Engine, named Mosco, that manages and facilitates sharing of mobile data in a privacy-preserving manner. We use Mosco to develop a location sharing and a health monitoring application. Mosco helps shorten the development process. Finally, we perform benchmarking experiments with Mosco, the results of which indicate small overhead and high scalability.",

People's attitudes towards privacy and protecting their personal data can vary significantly according to differing circumstances. In addition, notions of privacy and trust are changing over time. The authors provide numerous examples of the challenges facing policy-makers and identify some possible responses, but they see a need for improvements in the policy-making process in order to deal more effectively with varying contexts. They also identify some useful policy-making tools. They conclude that the broad brush policies of the past are not likely to be adequate to deal with the new challenges and that we are probably entering an era that will require development of “micro-policies”. While the new technologies will pose many challenges, perhaps the biggest challenge of all will be to ensure coherence of these micro-policies.",

These include inequality, poverty, corruption and migration, as well as climate change, loss of habitat and the ageing society. A conceptual framework for open governance systems enabled by ICT is proposed, drawing on evidence and examples from around the world as well as a critical appraisal of both academic and grey literature. The framework constructs a system of open assets, open services and open engagement, and this is used to move the e-government debate forward from a preoccupation with lean and small governments which ‘do more with less’ to examine the potential for open governance systems to also ‘do more with more’. This is achieved by enabling an open government and open public sector, as part of this open governance system, to ‘do more by leveraging more’ of the existing assets and resources across the whole of society, and not just within the public sector, many of which are unrealised and untapped, so in effect are ‘wasted’. The paper argues that efficiencies and productivity improvements are essential at all levels and across all actors, as is maximising both public and private value, but that they must also be seen at the societal level where trade-offs and interactions are required, and not only at the individual actor level.",

abstract = "Safety is an important issue that has increasingly been focused on. The reasons are the numerous accidents in process industries which require a hard look at current practices such as process design, process control, risk analysis and control, and risk assessment. Critical faults in process industries could lead to loss of lives, environmental damage and significant financial losses of property and equipment. Accidents typically result from the absence or breach of defenses or breach of security restrictions. The so-called defense-in-depth principle embodies the idea of multiple lines of defense and safety barriers along the accident scene; and this principle avoids ensuring the dependence of safety on a single element. Additionally, for several accidents, the identification of concealed faults and/or non observability of critical faults have been reported, during the evolution of faults following the accident, as relevant factors in the occurrence of catastrophic accidents. Finally, as process industries, are complex systems that interact with the environment, the disturbances caused by the environment must be properly diagnosed and treated by these systems. Based on these issues, this work initially proposes a safety control architecture that integrates the concept of reactivity associated with de principles of defense-in-depth, and safety-diagnosability addressing aspects related to critical faults prevention, mitigation and description of the development of failures. We believe that the safety control architecture is a change in paradigm contributing to risk analysis, risk and hazard control, and risk assessment.",

To construct a substantive theory of postpartum fatigue.
Design
Grounded theory.
Setting
Participants were recruited in the hospital after delivery and interviewed in their homes.
Participants
Thirteen primiparae (n = 5) and multiparae (n = 8) women between 2 and 5 weeks postpartum from diverse ethnic, age, obstetric, and financial contexts were theoretically sampled.
Results
Persevering was the central human process around which the grounded theory emerged. The process of persevering was explained through the relationships of influencing factors, postpartum fatigue, coping techniques, self‐transcendence, and caregiving. Participants persevered in caregiving of infants and older children in spite of an overwhelming desire to rest and sleep using self‐identified coping techniques in combination with the belief that their children brought purpose and meaning to their lives.
Conclusions
The theory “Persevering Through Postpartum Fatigue” contributes a more complete understanding of the complex phenomenon of postpartum fatigue as it is expressed in the everyday lives of women during the postpartum period. The results may be used to develop and implement health‐promoting nursing interventions to reduce postpartum fatigue and its health‐related consequences.",

The Smart City has been praised but also criticized as a discourse for its narrow epistemology. Limitations have led to reductionist benchmarking that lends itself to comparison, yet limits practitioners’ ability to translate findings into ontologically diverse action. In the related fields of information systems and management studies, a pragmatist research paradigm has been used to address this challenge. This article explores that pragmatist paradigm, describing how it can expand the current limits of the current Smart City discourse to include local politics, technologies, and the relational genealogies that characterize sociotechnical systems. The pragmatist methodology I explore here uses excerpts from practitioner oral histories—organized visually using actor-network theory—to define and explain the emergence of two Smart City initiatives. This approach is capable of a more situated and contingent practitioner explanation of the complexity of urban projects. Ultimately, the article concludes with reflections on the use of pragmatism for Smart City cases to provide a counter perspective to the dominant discourse.",

While it is widely known what cloud computing is, how data centers can build the cloud infrastructure and how applications can make use of this infrastructure, there is no common picture on what fog computing and particularly a fog node, as its main building block, really is. One of the first attempts to define a fog node was made by Cisco, qualifying a fog computing system as a “mini-cloud” located at the edge of the network and implemented through a variety of edge devices, interconnected by a variety, mostly wireless, communication technologies. Thus, a fog node would be the infrastructure implementing the said mini-cloud. Other proposals have their own definition of what a fog node is, usually in relation to a specific edge device, a specific use case or an application. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art in technologies for fog computing nodes, paying special attention to the contributions that analyze the role edge devices play in the fog node definition. We summarize and compare the concepts, lessons learned from their implementation, and end up showing how a conceptual framework is emerging towards a unifying fog node definition. We focus on core functionalities of a fog node as well as in the accompanying opportunities and challenges towards their practical realization in the near future.",

abstract = "Authenticated key establishment is a central requirement for securing IoT devices. For efficiency and management reasons, it might be desirable to avoid public-key-based solutions that are ubiquitous in traditional Internet settings but have many drawbacks for resource-constrained (RC) nodes. We introduce a novel Vicinity-based Pairing (VP) mechanism that allows authenticating arbitrary ‘unloaded’ RC-nodes by delegating trust from already authenticated and secured, we call it ‘loaded’, RC-nodes. For authenticating RC-nodes, VP exploits the correlation between channel profiles from devices that are in close physical proximity. In our setting, only devices that are within a few centimetres from the ‘loaded’ RC-nodes are authenticated after a user initiates such a process. Subsequently, the embedded end device can extract an unique shared symmetric key with another device such as a SCADA gateway, again by exploiting channel parameters. Based on extensive experiments, we propose new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from channel parameters for use in VP. We describe the first MITM-resistant device pairing protocol purely based on a single wireless interface with an extensive adversarial model and protocol analysis. We show that existing wireless devices can be retro-fitted with the VP protocol via software updates, i.e. without changes to the hardware. Implementation results of our embedded prototype demonstrates that the approach has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost and efforts of securing low-resource devices that are common in the IoT.",

Many remote user authentication schemes have been proposed for authenticating the legitimate users of a wireless sensor network. Most of the recently proposed schemes are vulnerable to one or more security attacks and are inefficient in terms of processing time. In this paper, the scheme proposed by Xue et al. has been reviewed and it has been found that the scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack, stolen smart card attack, server spoofing attack. This paper proposes a robust and efficient password based authentication scheme which is secure against all well known security attacks. Moreover, the scheme has a low computation and communication cost and does not suffer from time synchronization problem.

Although a diverse collection of cloud resources (e.g., servers) is available, choosing the most optimized and cost-effective set of cloud resources for a given web application and set of quality of service (QoS) goals is not a straightforward task. Optimizing cloud resource allocation is a critical task for offering web applications using a software as a service model in the cloud, where minimizing operational cost while ensuring QoS goals are met is critical to meeting customer demands and maximizing profit. Manual load testing with different sets of cloud resources, followed by comparison of test results to QoS goals is tedious and inaccurate due to the limitations of the load testing tools, challenges characterizing resource utilization, significant manual test orchestration effort, and challenges identifying resource bottlenecks. This paper introduces our work using a modeling framework – ROAR (Resource Optimization, Allocation and Recommendation System) to simplify, optimize, and automate cloud resource allocation decisions to meet QoS goals for web applications, including complex multi-tier application distributed in different server groups. ROAR uses a domain-specific language to describe the configuration of the web application, the APIs to benchmark and the expected QoS requirements (e.g., throughput and latency), and the resource optimization engine uses model-based analysis and code generation to automatically deploy and load test the application in multiple resource configurations in order to derive a cost-optimal resource configuration that meets the QoS goals.",

These systems are extremely sensitive to software vulnerabilities, as their exploitation could lead to injury, damage to equipment, or environmental catastrophe. This paper proposes a hardware-based security architecture called SOFIA, which protects software running on microprocessors used in CPSes. SOFIA provides mechanisms to protect software integrity and control flow integrity. This allows the processor to defend against a large number of attacks, including code injection, code reuse, and fault-based attacks on the program counter. In addition, the architecture also defends against software copyright infringement and reverse engineering. All protection mechanisms are enforced in hardware using cryptographic techniques. We are the first to propose a mechanism to enforce control flow integrity at the finest possible granularity using cryptographic techniques. A SOFIA core has been created by implementing the proposed architectural features on a LEON3 microprocessor. The SOFIA core requires that its software conforms to a strict format. To this end, we additionally designed and implemented a software toolchain to compile source code that adheres to the formatting rules. Several benchmarks were compiled with the SOFIA toolchain, and were executed on a SOFIA core running on an FPGA, showing an average total execution time overhead of 106% compared to an unmodified LEON3 core. Our hardware evaluation shows a clock speed reduction of 23.2%.",

Over the past two decades, research has focused on simplifying dependability analysis by looking at how we can synthesise dependability information from system models automatically. This has led to the field of model-based dependability analysis (MBDA). Different tools and techniques have been developed as part of MBDA to automate the generation of dependability analysis artefacts such as fault trees. Firstly, this paper reviews the standard fault tree with its limitations. Secondly, different extensions of standard fault trees are reviewed. Thirdly, this paper reviews a number of prominent MBDA techniques where fault trees are used as a means for system dependability analysis and provides an insight into their working mechanism, applicability, strengths and challenges. Finally, the future outlook for MBDA is outlined, which includes the prospect of developing expert and intelligent systems for dependability analysis of complex open systems under the conditions of uncertainty.",

Leveraging the increasing variety of connectivity options available to devices solves many problems such as capacity, spectrum efficiency, coverage and reliability. Anytime decisions are made for selection, handover, scheduling or routing many performance metrics along with energy efficiency and cost for access must be considered. The increased number of choices in an HWN makes the problem more difficult than traditional homogeneous networks since each Radio Access Technology (RAT) has unique characteristics. For instance, Bluetooth networks have low range and speed but are cheap compared to 4G networks. These types of observations can be factored into decision making in HWNs. Quality of Service and Experience should be considered so that the best possible configuration of connectivity, price and user application is made. All of this should occur autonomously. This paper provides a survey of recent works in HWNs with these ideas in mind. Existing approaches are categorized by function. Limitations and strengths of solutions are highlighted and comparisons between approaches are made to provide a starting point for further research in the area.",

One important task which can be performed by nodes in WSNs is to find a common solution to a problem by using distributed processing. In this paper, we study the problem of distributed estimation, where a group of nodes are required to collectively estimate a sparse parameter vector of interest, and we solve it by an estimation algorithm based on the set membership (SM) and affine projection (AP) methods. At each iteration of the algorithm, in addition to the current data, the proposed algorithm uses data obtained from previous measurements to attain faster convergence rate. A method is also proposed to select the constraint bound for set membership such that the computational load is uniformly distributed among the nodes of network. Then the distributed estimation algorithm is analyzed and a closed form expression for the steady state mean square deviation (MSD) is developed. The performance of proposed method is assessed via computer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides faster convergence rate and smaller steady state MSD value when compared to conventional methods such as diffusion least mean squares (LMS), distributed set membership normalized LMS (DSM-NLMS), and distributed APA. Moreover, it achieves lower computational load compared to the AP method. These advantages make the proposed method useful in sparse parameter vector estimation whenever the nodes have sufficient memory size.",

These algorithms are the backbone of data protection and secrecy for highly sensitive and classified data. The selection of a suitable crypto-algorithm will dynamically affect the lifespan and performance of a device in terms of battery-life, hardware memory, computation latency and communication bandwidth. In the current developments of the resource constrained environments, the trend is shifting towards lightweight algorithmic hardware designs. To select a suitable cryptographic algorithm for an application or an environment, the understandings of both the algorithmic requirements in terms of hardware and the specifications of the development platform intended has to be established. However, there are numerous ciphers in the literature that has various functionality, specifications and strength. Moreover, there are numerous literatures that cover the trend and specifications of security solutions in hardware constrained environment, employing known cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of modern symmetric cryptographic solutions used in resource constrained environment (RCE), including literatures from the area of wireless sensor network (WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) and other resource constrained platforms. This paper aims to provide a survey of the ciphers that were used in the past, and what are the ciphers that are currently active, and their respective specifications and applications in the area of modern world RCEs.

As opposed to UHF broadcast spectrum, which contains unassigned or idle segments known as white spaces, the 400MHz band is characterised by intensive licence usage. However, productive spectrum usage does not guarantee allocative efficiency, which would require knowledge of the highest value service for each licence. 400MHz frequencies are not priced on opportunity cost. It is therefore difficult to ascertain the economically efficient mix of services to deploy in the 400MHz band. Drawing parallels with the high-economic value revealed and generated through the operations of unlicensed white space devices in UHF broadcast spectrum, we identify untapped 400MHz spectrum capacity, which we refer to as narrowband spaces. Encouraging dynamic spectrum usage of narrowband spaces could, similarly to TV white space usage help realise the efficient allocation of the 400MHz band. However, the narrowband nature of the 400MHz licences and high licensing turnover imply a significantly different concept of dynamic spectrum access than that considered for TV Bands. The paper discusses regulatory implications and the type of services suited to exploit narrowband spaces.",

A contention based approach exploiting the unused cellular spectrum, e.g. of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE), is proposed. The proposed approach uses subsets of LTE resource blocks (RBs) as allocation units. It is based on channel aware reservation slotted Aloha over orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) using time/frequency slots, which leads to a reduction of collision probability, prevents collisions in the transmission phase, and allows detecting these collisions at the reservation phase. The proposed method relies on an access point (AP) that indicates the “available” OFDMA subcarriers to the contending devices after receiving this information through coordination with the cellular base station (BS): The BS informs the AP of the LTE RBs that it intends to keep free for a certain time period (e.g., because the current load on the network does not mandate their allocation to primary cellular users). Then, with the proposed approach, the AP transmits pilot signals on the free channels so that they can be used by the contending devices. Simulation results show that a large number of smart meters can be successfully accommodated within a limited coverage area with the proposed approach, while transmitting their measurement data in real-time.",

abstract = "Obesity is a global health issue that affects 2.1 billion people worldwide and has an economic impact of approximately $2 trillion. It is a disease that can make the aging process worse by impairing physical function, which can lead to people becoming more frail and immobile. Nevertheless, it is envisioned that technology can be used to aid in motivating behavioural changes to combat this preventable condition. The ubiquitous presence of wearable and mobile devices has enabled a continual stream of quantifiable data (e.g. physiological signals) to be collected about ourselves. This data can then be used to monitor physical activity to aid in self-reflection and motivation to alter behaviour. However, such information is susceptible to noise interference, which makes processing and extracting knowledge from such data challenging. This paper posits our approach that collects and processes physiological data that has been collected from tri-axial accelerometers and a heart-rate monitor, to detect physical activity. Furthermore, an end-user use case application has also been proposed that integrates these findings into a smartwatch visualization. This provides a method of visualising the results to the user so that they are able to gain an overview of their activity. The goal of the paper has been to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning in distinguishing physical activity. This has been achieved by (i) focusing on wearable sensors to collect data and using our methodology to process this raw lifelogging data so that features can be extracted/selected.

abstract = "Given the computational complexity and sophisticated implementation of traditionally parametric channel estimators, it has been gradually recognized that the existing data detection methodologies based on the finite impulse response (FIR) propagation channel modeling may become infeasible for ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors, especially in some large-scale distributed scenarios. By exploiting the implicit information involved in the received signals, in this investigation, we present a non-parametric UWB data detection scheme for the distributed radar sensor networks. A novel characteristic representation is suggested first. From a pattern classification point of view, a group of quantitative features are then extracted by making full use of the inherent property of UWB propagations. Thus, UWB data detection is formulated as a pattern classification problem in a multidimensional feature space. By thoroughly utilizing the self-similarity of the representative patterns, the ant swarm intelligence inspired clustering algorithm, with the new designed ant movement strategy, is adopted to perform unsupervised data detections. The developed scheme is independent of any a priori modeling information, which essentially avoids the expensive parametric estimators and thus enables practically feasible realizations. To alleviate the computational burden, the principle component analysis (PCA) is further employed to compress the feature space. The simulation results validate the new algorithm, which is superior to the other popular non-parametric data analysis schemes.",

In addition, we aim to identify the important open research issues. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted by a multiphase study selection process using the published literature since the introduction of DDS in 2003. Results: We reviewed 468 papers that are discovered using a well-planned review protocol, and 34 of them were assessed as primary studies related to our research questions.

While dealing with big sensing data streams, a Data Stream Manager (DSM) must always verify the security (i.e. authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) to ensure end-to-end security and maintain data quality. Existing technologies are not suitable, because real time introduces delay in data stream. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Prime Number Based Security Verification (DPBSV) scheme for big data streams. Our scheme is based on a common shared key that updated dynamically by generating synchronized prime numbers. The common shared key updates at both ends, i.e., source sensing devices and DSM, without further communication after handshaking. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our DPBSV scheme show that it can significantly improve the efficiency of verification process by reducing the time and utilizing a smaller buffer size in DSM.",

abstract = "In many areas, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has made the decisive steps from prototyping to true manufacturing technology. AM processes excel based on aspects like outstanding geometrical flexibility and lack of tooling, which allows significant lead time reductions both in initial product design and in case of design adaptations. However, in production today, most of these advantages are realized based on homogeneous materials. Attempts at advancing the state of the art address the topic of material combinations and functionally graded materials. The challenges faced by such approaches differ in their level of severity, and are influenced in this respect by the actual AM process chosen. Beyond composites with spatially varying properties, the next level of complexity is the integration of geometrically defined 3D structures within the volume of a part, and specifically functional structures at that. Endeavours of the latter kind are currently receiving increased attention under headlines like “Structural Electronics” or “3D Electronics Printing”. Here, the surface or volume integrated structure typically is a sensor or electronic system. Beyond this system, the AM process then either provides a complex 3D substrate and thus addresses the packaging issue and/or replaces a conventional PCB, or it generates an engineering component directly and closely integrates it with electronic and sensor systems. So far, the backbone of most solutions realized have been hybrid production systems that integrate different manufacturing processes in a single piece of equipment. The present work provides a brief introduction to the various AM techniques and discusses a disambiguation based on their general capability of producing functional structures on a volume integration level. A classification of such structures is suggested that accounts for their level of complexity in relation to the typical, layer-wise manufacturing scheme adopted in AM. Examples stemming from a global research landscape are discussed in the context of this classification. In this, two special foci are selected reflecting related activities at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials (Fraunhofer IFAM): One of these is a combination of manufacturing processes, with functional printing and other direct write techniques linked to AM processes in a dedicated manufacturing cell. The other addresses integration of pre-fabricated electronic components like RFID systems into metal components produced by means of selective laser melting (SLM).The study closes with an overview of future research trends towards producing components with integrated electronics. In doing so, special emphasis is given to AM techniques that allow for in-process switching of materials and thus have the potential of realizing complex systems not by combination of processes, but within the boundaries of a single process. Also addressed are potential application scenarios that profit specifically from the combination of AM and sensor integration.",

Typically these systems are used to gather large amounts of data, while the detection of anomalies (such as system failures, intrusion, or unanticipated behavior of the environment) in the data (or other types or processing) is performed in centralized computer systems. In spite of the great interest that it attracts, the systematic porting and analysis of centralized anomaly detection algorithms to a decentralized paradigm (compatible with the aforementioned sensor systems) has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. We approach this task from a new angle, assessing the viability of localized (in-node) anomaly detection based on machine learning. The main challenges we address are: (1) deploying decentralized, automated, online learning, anomaly detection algorithms within the stringent constraints of typical embedded systems; and (2) evaluating the performance of such algorithms and comparing them with that of centralized ones. To this end, we first analyze (and port) single and multi-dimensional input classifiers that are trained incrementally online and whose computational requirements are compatible with the limitations of embedded platforms. Next, we combine multiple classifiers in a single online ensemble. Then, using both synthetic and real-world datasets from different application domains, we extensively evaluate the anomaly detection performance of our algorithms and ensemble, in terms of precision and recall, and compare it to that of well-known offline, centralized machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the ensemble performs better than each individual decentralized classifier and that it can match the performance of the offline alternatives, thus showing that our approach is a viable solution to detect anomalies, even in environments with little a priori knowledge.",

abstract = "Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer’s cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.",

abstract = "Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is envisaged to play an important role in the safety of drivers and passengers when moving on the roads. However, VANET still faces many challenges before it could be deployed. One such challenge is shortage of radio frequency spectrum channels. VANET has been allocated 7 channels for dedicated short range communication at 5.9 GHz band. The 7 channels are likely to get congested in high vehicle densities when many vehicles are contending for the same medium. Consequently, affecting the transmission of safety and emergency messages. To alleviate the problem of scarcity channels, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) through cognitive radio (CR) technology has been proposed. One of the core functions of a CR is to identify spectrum holes in licensed frequency bands that can be accessed by unlicensed users through spectrum sensing. In VANET, spectrum sensing is challenging because of the mobility nature of vehicles, dynamic topological changes as well as other unique characteristics not found in other networks. However, these challenges have not been fully studied and how they affect spectrum sensing in cognitive vehicular network (CVN). In this paper, we discuss challenges associated with spectrum sensing in CVN. We describe the primary system activity model used by many schemes proposed in literature. Furthermore, we present an in depth analysis of state-of-art cooperative spectrum sensing techniques for CVN from 2010 to May 2016. In addition, we present some of the open issues in spectrum sensing for CVN.",

The paper examines the techniques that foster information imbalances, such as media and propaganda, knowledge production, educational systems, legal and organizational structures, exclusive information networks, and surveillance. We conclude that in the absence of greater transparency, the deleterious effects of unequal access to information will continue and deepen.

It plays an important role in trust management that automatically ensures trust relationships among system entities and enhances system security. But trust evidence collection and process may cause privacy leakage, which makes involved entities reluctant to provide personal evidence that is essential for trust evaluation. Current literature pays little attention to Privacy-Preserving Trust Evaluation (PPTE). Existing work still has many limitations, especially on generality, efficiency and reliability. In this paper, we propose two practical schemes to guard privacy of trust evidence providers based on additive homomorphic encryption in order to support a traditional class of trust evaluation that contains evidence summation. The first scheme achieves better computational efficiency, while the second one provides greater security at the expense of a higher computational cost. Accordingly, two trust evaluation algorithms are further proposed to flexibly support different application cases. Specifically, these algorithms can overcome attacks raised by internal malicious evidence providers to some extent even though the trust evaluation is partially performed in an encrypted form. Extensive analysis and performance evaluation show the security and effectivity of our schemes for potential application prospect and their efficiency to support big data process.",

In the scheme, the control information interaction for the mobile handoff is achieved in the link layer, and the routing of the control information is automatically performed through the network topology, which saves the power and the delay time consumed by the routing establishment. In addition, neither does the mobile entity need a care-of address during the mobility process, nor is involved in the mobile handoff process, which reduces the mobile entity’s power consumption and prolongs its life span. From the theoretical and simulative perspectives, the paper analyzes the performance parameters, including the mobility handoff cost, the mobility handoff delay time and packet loss rate, and the analytical results show that the performance of the scheme is better than other schemes.",

Exploring new features such as non-linearity, integration, supply-chaining and flexibility, more recently focus has been on distributed and collaborative holonic and multi-agent approaches. This production evolution reflects the evolution in manufacturing design and the integration of manufacturing with the ubiquitous culture introduced by e-Work, communication and information systems. More recently, there is another influential vector, typically not considered in the technological analysis of manufacturing advances: the tendency to move from the traditional process- and product-oriented approaches to service-oriented approaches. Such tendency is being spread in research labs and increasingly, in current management decisions, especially in computer and cyber industries. In this article, we analyze closely the coalition between e-Work and service-oriented approach towards a new manufacturing architecture composed by a grid of services which operates in parallel to a main process that defines the manufactured artifact—targeting an interesting blending of product and service. The need to explore and provide different design approaches for this emerging product-service architecture (PSA) is discussed as a future challenge, which demands multidisciplinary tools for analysis and planning.",

abstract = "The exponential growth in the demands of users to access various resources during mobility has led to the popularity of Vehicular Mobile Cloud. Vehicular users may access various resources on road from the cloud which acts as a service provider for them. Most of the existing proposals on vehicular cloud use unicast sender-based data forwarding, which results in an overall performance degradation with respect to the metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and reliable data transmission. Most of the applications for vehicular cloud have tight upper bounds with respect to reliable transmission. In view of the above, in this paper, we formulate the problem of reliable data forwarding as a Bayesian Coalition Game (BCG) using Learning Automata concepts. Learning Automata (LA) are assumed as the players in the game stationed on the vehicles. For taking adaptive decisions about reliable data forwarding, each player observes the moves of the other players in the game. For this purpose, a coalition game is formulated among the players of the game for taking adaptive decisions. For each action taken by a player in the game, it gets a reward or a penalty from the environment, and accordingly, it updates its action probability vector. An adaptive Learning Automata based Contention Aware Data Forwarding (LACADF) is also proposed. The proposed scheme is evaluated in different network scenarios with respect to parameters such as message overhead, throughput, and delay by varying the density and mobility of the vehicles. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is better than the other conventional schemes with respect to the above metrics.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel disease-specific feature selection method which consists of a one-versus-one (OvO) features ranking stage and a feature search stage wrapped in the same OvO-rule support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier. The proposed method differs from traditional approaches in that it focuses on the selection of effective feature subsets for distinguishing a class from others by making OvO comparison. The electrocardiograms (ECG) from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH-AR) are used to evaluate the proposed feature selection method. The ECG features adopted include inter-beat and intra-beat intervals, amplitude morphology, area morphology and morphological distance. Following the recommendation of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), all the heartbeat samples of MIT-BIH-AR are grouped into four classes, namely, normal or bundle branch block (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). The division of training and testing data complies with the inter-patient schema. Experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed feature selection method is 86.66%, outperforming those methods without feature selection. The sensitivities for the classes N, S, V and F are 88.94%, 79.06%, 85.48% and 93.81% respectively, and the corresponding positive predictive values are 98.98%, 35.98%, 92.75% and 13.74% respectively. In terms of geometric means of sensitivity and positive predictivity, the proposed method also demonstrates better performance than other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.",

Various context-aware applications have been designed on vehicular ad hoc networks, offering a wide range of services to drivers, including traffic management, collision avoidance, and convenient supports, just to name a few. This paper reviews and classifies existing context-aware applications as used in vehicular networks. A classification framework with three dimensions including the environment, system-and-application, and context-awareness is proposed. This framework is then used to review the existing context-aware transportation systems for each dimension, which in turn consists of some parameters. Based on this framework, existing context-aware research projects are reviewed and classified. Finally, a clear vision of research directions in this area is described.",

Following the dark days of 9/11, security and surveillance became paramount. More recently, in Europe, there has been a policy commitment to restore privacy to centre stage. This paper examines the legal tools available to ensure that privacy and personal data protection are respected in attempts to ensure the security of our society, and finds that improvements are needed in our legal and regulatory framework if privacy is indeed to be respected by law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies. It then goes on to argue that privacy impact assessments should be used to sort out the necessity and proportionality of security and surveillance programmes and policies vis-à-vis privacy.",

The meaning of ‘public security’ is not entirely clear and there are various laws which authorise the invasion of privacy for public security reasons. Technology is developing at such a fast pace and in a more diffused manner without taking on board its privacy implications whilst technological privacy enhancement mechanisms are not catching up. The law of privacy is not sufficiently elaborate and is slow in coming to terms to deal with these novel situations posed by rapid technological advances. The paper thus develops universally legally binding minimum core principles that could be applied indiscriminately to all privacy intrusive technology.",

In WSNs, congestion is caused by the following factors: packet collision, node buffer overflow, transmission channel contention, transmission rate, many-to-one data transmission scheme and dynamic time variation transmission channel. Indeed, congestion has a significant impact on Quality of Services (QoS) parameters such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption in wireless nodes. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of major congestion control mechanisms used in WSNs and classifies the available methods into four categories i.e. traffic control protocols, resource control protocols, queue assisted protocols and priority-aware protocols. This review paper compares the important techniques with each other in terms of congestion detection, congestion notification and congestion mitigation as well as directions for future researches and works.",

Nevertheless, the increase in the use of context-aware technologies has sparked the growth in assistive applications resulting in a need to enable adaptation to reflect the changes in user behaviours. This paper introduces a systematic approach to service personalisation for mobile users in pervasive environments and presents a service-oriented distributed system architecture. The developed approach makes use of semantic technologies for user modelling and personalisation reasoning. In the paper we characterise user behaviours and needs in pervasive environments upon which ontological user models are created with special emphasis being placed on ontological modelling of dynamic and adaptive user profiles. We develop a rule-based personalisation mechanism that exploits semantic web rule mark-up language for rule design and a combination of semantic and rule-based reasoning for personalisation. We use two case studies focusing on providing personalised travel assistance for people using Help-on-Demand services deployed on a smart-phone to contextualise the discussions within the paper. The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype system, which includes Help-on-Demand services, content management services, user models and personalisation mechanisms in addition to application specific rules. Experiments have been designed and conducted to test and evaluate the approach with initial results demonstrating the functionality of the approach.",

The Trusted Domain platform fits existing legacy technologies by managing their interoperability and access controls, and it seeks to avoid the security issues of relying on third-party servers outside the home. It is a distributed system that enables secure end-to-end communication with home automation devices, and it supports device revocations as well as a structure of intersecting sets of nodes for scalability. Devices in the Trusted Domain are registered in a list that is distributed using a robust epidemic protocol optimized for constrained resources and network load sharing. The resource-intensive encryption operations are reduced to a minimum by sending short signed update queries and only synchronizing when necessary. An experiment on an embedded implementation examines timing, footprint, and behavioral properties of the protocol. The protocol has been formally verified by the UPPAAL model-checking tool.",

Classification and authentication are popular provided services of many mobile applications which have high probability to involve the sensitive information of the users. In this paper, we propose a new cloud-enabled and Privacy-preserving sparse representation classification (P2-SRC) system to protect the privacy of both the “data contributors” and “application users” when cloud server is untrusted. Different from the state-of-the-art approaches which only consider the attacks on data values, our proposed system, P2-SRC, addresses multiple types of privacy attacks including Content Privacy Attacks, Source Privacy Attacks and Label Privacy Attacks. As a result, besides the data values, in P2-SRC, the identities and activities of the users are also protected. According to our evaluations on two different classification applications (face recognition and activity recognition), P2-SRC achieves almost the same classification accuracy compared with traditional SRC approach which indicates the security add-ons do not affect the accuracy of the SRC classifier. We also demonstrate that it outperforms the most related work, Pickle, significantly on recognition accuracy and privacy protections. Meanwhile the implementation of P2-SRC in a face recognition application on smartphones demonstrates that P2-SRC based authentication system accounts for only 0.000041% of the total energy supply of a normal smartphone and the average responding time is around 1.1 s for each recognition request.",

We warn and advise the regulator that research platforms and the use of other equipment for the collection and processing of personal data in the Union for research may escape from data protection legislation once the new data protection regulation applies. This is due to the revised territorial application rules in the new regulation. We therefore plead for more reflection and clear terminology and for keeping the criterion of the use of equipment for the territorial application of data protection legislation. Rejecting this criterion may result in considerable better (competitive) positions for non-Union companies and institutions collecting and using personal data collected in the Union for research as compared to Union research organisations.",

So generalized multigranulation rough set theory is a desirable fusion method, in which upper and lower approximations are approximated by granular structures satisfying a certain level of information. However, the relationship between a equivalence class and a concept under each granular structure is very strict. Therefore, more attention are paid to fault tolerance capabilities of double-quantitative rough set theory and the feasibility of majority principle. By considering relative and absolute quantitative information between the class and concept, we propose two kinds of generalized multigranulation double-quantitative decision-theoretic rough sets(GMDq-DTRS). Firstly, we define upper and lower approximations of generalized multigranulation double-quantitative rough sets by introducing upper and lower support characteristic functions. Then, important properties of two kinds of GMDq-DTRS models are explored and corresponding decision rules are given. Moreover, internal relations between the two models under certain constraints and GMDq-DTRS and other models are explored. The definition of the approximation accuracy in GMDq-DTRS is proposed to show the advantage of GMDq-DTRS. Finally, an illustrative case is shown to elaborate the theories advantage of GMDq-DTRS which are valuable to deal with practical problems. Generalized multigranulation double-quantitative decision-theoretic rough set theory will be more feasible when making decisions in real life.",

Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements. Research, technology, and policy recommendations are also outlined.",

The data is being inundated proactively from several sources in various forms; especially social media and in modern data science vocabulary is being recognized as Big Data. Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the growing role of cloud computing in Big Data ecosystem. Also, we propose a novel XCLOUDX {XCloudX, X…X}classification to zoom in to gauge the intuitiveness of the scientific name of the cloud-assisted NoSQL Big Data models and analyze whether XCloudX always uses cloud computing underneath or vice versa. XCloudX symbolizes those NoSQL Big Data models that embody the term “cloud” in their name, where X is any alphanumeric variable. The discussion is strengthen by a set of important case studies. Furthermore, we study the emergence of as-a-Service era, motivated by cloud computing drive and explore the new members beyond traditional cloud computing stack, developed in the past couple of years.",

In experiment, the birefringence in sensing fiber was modulated by ultrasound signals at 3MHz and 5MHz, and the test distance and driving voltage were set respectively according to the ultrasound frequency. Agreement between theoretical and experimental results was obtained for ultrasound wave propagating from different distances (40mm to 10mm) and different DFUS driving voltage (5V to 20V).

It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.",

Since the patient-related data in the form of text, image, voice, etc. is significant in the process of healthcare services, efficiently managing these media data from various WBAN is vital for various applications. Recently, Cloud-assisted WBAN has become popular that can supply massive computing, flexible storage and various software services to WBAN. Still, there are some challenging issues exist in this platform to deliver and share the huge media healthcare data to remote terminals timely with guaranteed QoS support. In the paper, we propose an efficient network model that combines WBAN and Cloud for valid data sharing. The proposed network architecture is designed as four layers: perception layer, network layer, cloud computing layer, and application layer. In the network, the integration of TCP/IP and Zigbee in the coordinator devices is utilized. Consequently, WBAN coordinators can compatibility inter-operate with various local networks such as WiFi and LTE network to support high mobility of users. Besides, we integrate Content Centric Networking (CCN) with our proposed architecture to improve the ability of the WBAN coordinator. Thus, it can support uninterrupted media healthcare content delivery. In addition, adaptive streaming technique was also utilized to reduce packet loss. Various simulations were conducted using OPNET simulator to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture in terms of transmitting a huge amount of media healthcare data in real-time under traditional IP-based network.",

Three large-scale performance tests are conducted to reveal the contributions of gender, age, educational level of attainment, Internet experience, and amount of Internet use on both medium- and content-related Internet skills. Age appears to have a negative influence on medium-related skills. However, there is a positive contribution to the level of content-related skills, meaning that older generations perform better than the younger. Unfortunately, they are impeded by their low level of medium-related skills in such a way that the actual result is negative. This noteworthy conclusion, to our knowledge, has hardly received any attention in digital divide research. Educational attainment appears significant for both medium- and content-related Internet skills. This conclusion contrasts somewhat with other research that claims that people learn digital skills more in practice than in formal educational settings. Internet experience only contributes to medium-related skills. It appears that content-related skills do not grow with years of Internet experience and the number of hours spent online weekly. The latter only has some effect on medium-related skills.",

The new generation of GPS-based tolling systems allow for a much higher degree of road sensing than has been available up to now. We propose an adaptive sampling scheme to collect accurate real-time traffic information from large-scale implementations of on-board GPS-based devices over a road network. The goal of the system is to minimize the transmission costs over all vehicles while satisfying requirements in the accuracy and timeliness of the traffic information obtained. The system is designed to make use of cellular communication as well as leveraging additional technologies such as roadside units equipped with WiFi and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). As opposed to fixed sampling schemes, which transmit at regular intervals, the sampling policy we propose is adaptive to the road network and the importance of the links that the vehicle traverses. Since cellular communications are costly, in the basic centralized scheme, the vehicle is not aware of the road conditions on the network. We extend the scheme to handle non-cellular communications via roadside units and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Under a general traffic model, we prove that our scheme always outperforms the baseline scheme in terms of transmission cost while satisfying accuracy and real-time requirements. Our analytical results are further supported via simulations based on actual road networks for both the centralized and V2V settings.",

abstract = "A few years ago, the Internet of (Web) Service vision came to offer services to all aspects of life and business. The increasing number of Web services make service recommendation a directive research to help users discover services. Furthermore, the rapid development of social network has accelerated the development of social recommendation approach to avoid the data sparsity and cold-start problems that are not treated very well in the collaborative filtering approach. On the one hand, the pervasive use of the social media provides a big social information about the users (e.g., personnel data, social activities, relationships). Hence, the use of trust relation becomes a necessity to filter and select only the useful information. Several trust-aware service recommender systems have been proposed in literature but they do not consider the time in trust level detection among users. On the other hand, in the reality, the majority of users prefer the advice not only of their trusted friends but also their expertise in some domain-specific. In fact, the taking into account of user’s expertise in recommendation step can resolve the user’s disorientation problem. For these reasons, we present, in this paper, a Web service decentralized discovery approach which is based on two complementary mechanisms. The trust detection is the first mechanism to detect the social trust level among users. This level is defined in terms of the users’ interactions for a period of time and their interest similarity which are inferred from their social profiles. The service recommendation is the second mechanism which combines the social and collaborative approaches to recommend to the active user the appropriate services according to the expertise level of his most trustworthy friends. This level is extracted from the friends’ past invocation histories according to the domain-specific which is known in advance in the target user’s query. Performance evaluation shows that each proposed mechanism achieves good results. The proposed Level of social Trust (LoT) metric gives better precision more than 50% by comparing with the same metric without taking into account the time factor. The proposed service recommendation mechanism which based on the trust and the domain-specific expertise gives, firstly, a RMSE value lower than other trust-aware recommender systems like TidalTrust, MoleTrust and TrustWalker. Secondly, it provides a better response rate than the recommendation mechanism which based only on trust with a difference equal to 4%.",

To improve both execution efficiency and searching accuracy, the proposed algorithm searches the compressing method of the Lucene index and then filters that index. Simulations are conducted on a Storm platform to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can increase the response speed by 67.79% with an accuracy of 95.94%, and the response speed decreases by 11.6–53.2%.",

By virtue of the great success in computer vision fields achieved by deep learning approach, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it is a good way to tackle the SR problem using CNNs. In this paper, a 7-layer dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) with skip-connections is proposed to recover the high-resolution image from the interpolated low-resolution image. Dilated convolutions allow us to arbitrarily control the field-of-view (FOV) of the network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dilated convolution and skip-connections for image super-resolution. We explore different FOV of the network by adjusting the dilation rate and different combination of contextual information using skip-connections to achieve a trade-off between performance and speed. We also design a cascade model (CDCNN) to address the different magnification factors problems. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a notable improvement in terms of both quantitative and qualitative measurements.",

At first, we present taxonomy of the cipher design space and accurately define the scope of lightweight ciphers for low-resource devices. Moreover, this paper discusses the performance metrics that are commonly reported in the literature when comparing cipher implementations. The sources of inaccuracies and deviations are carefully examined. In order to mitigate the confusion in the composite metrics, we developed a general metric which includes the basic metrics. Our analysis designated the energy/bit metric as the most appropriate metric for energy-constrained low-resource designs. Afterwards, the software and hardware implementations of the block cipher algorithms are surveyed, investigated, and compared. The paper selects the top performing ciphers in various metrics and suggests the Present cipher as a good reference for hardware implementations. What transpires from this survey is that unresolved research questions and issues are yet to be addressed by future research projects.",

Artificial neural network (ANN) approaches have the ability to solve complex decision-making problems that involve uncertainty and a large amount of information in a fast and reliable way. The application of this evolutionary CI technique to analyze a large amount of data is an important strategy to solve several problems in healthcare management. This paper proposes the modeling, performance evaluation, and comparison analysis of an ANN technique known as the radial basis function network (RBFNetwork) to identify possible cases of gestational diabetes that can lead to multiple risks for both the pregnant women and the fetus. This method achieved promising results with a precision of 0.785, F-measure of 0.786, ROC area of 0.839, and Kappa statistic of 0.5092. These indicators show that this ANN-based approach is an excellent predictor for gestational diabetes mellitus. This research provides a comprehensive decision-making model capable of improving the care provided to women who are at a risk of developing gestational diabetes, which is the most common metabolic problem in gestation with a prevalence of 3–18%. Thus, this work can contribute to the reduction of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity rates.",

A primary concern in HIEs is the need for explicit authorization of information exchange in an auditable manner. However, we find that existing approaches for authorization in health information systems exhibit several drawbacks in meeting the needs of HIE, with non-cryptographic approaches lacking a secure and reliable mechanism for access policy enforcement, while cryptographic approaches being too expensive, complex and limited in specifying policies. This paper aims to overcome these drawbacks by presenting a simple and efficient patient-centric authorization protocol for information sharing in cloud-based HIE systems. The proposed protocol is built using a novel trapdoor hash-based proxy signature scheme, and ensures that the authorization is authentic with respect to both providers and patients, and complies with the established access control policies. Features of the proposed protocol include auditability, non-interactive and on-demand operation, and specification and secure/reliable enforcement of flexible access control policies. A detailed security and performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol is provably secure against forgery under the discrete log assumption, and achieves the best overall performance compared to other well-known schemes in the literature.",

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.",

In this paper we examine the process of setting up such a comparison and the metric used. Performance comparisons on Cloud and non-Cloud systems, deployed for biomedical scientists, have been conducted to identify improvements of efficiency and performance. Prior to the experiments, network latency, file size and job failures were identified as factors which degrade performance and experiments were conducted to understand their impacts. Organizational Sustainability Modeling (OSM) is used before, during and after the experiments to ensure fair comparisons are achieved. OSM defines the actual and expected execution time, risk control rates and is used to understand key outputs related to both Cloud and non-Cloud experiments. Forty experiments on both Cloud and non-Cloud systems were undertaken with two case studies. The first case study was focused on transferring and backing up 10,000 files of 1 GB each and the second case study was focused on transferring and backing up 1000 files 10 GB each. Results showed that first, the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud was lower than on the non-Cloud system. Second, there was more than 99% consistency between the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud while no comparable consistency was found on the non-Cloud system. Third, the improvement in efficiency was higher on the Cloud than the non-Cloud. OSM is the metric used to analyze the collected data and provided synthesis and insights to the data analysis and visualization of the two case studies.",

This paper proposes a new linear time-invariant model-based CHD evaluation method, which allows evaluating the CHD development dynamically over the whole lifetime. Currently identified model can give the dynamic evaluation of 43–77 years with about 5% errors in comparison with the clinical gold standard, the SYNTAX score. In addition, the model also gives a quantitative weight to each risk factor, which is also helpful for risk control in both clinics and ubiquitous healthcare. Current application of this approach in clinics has proved its efficiency in the pre-diagnosing and post-clinical ubiquitous health management.",

In this work, local authentication and remote authentication are respectively designed for cloud assisted wearable devices. In the local authentication mode, hash based selective disclosure mechanism and Chebyshev chaotic map are jointly applied to achieve mutual authentication between a wearable device and a smart phone. In the remote authentication mode, Merkle hash tree based selective disclosure mechanism is designed to improve the structure of data fields in the certificate, and a yoking-proof is established to realize interactions between two wearable devices and a smart phone, and is further transmitted to the cloud server for simultaneous verification. Meanwhile, security formal analysis is performed based on the BAN logic for proving that the proposed remote authentication protocol has theoretical design correctness. It indicates that the proposed authentication scheme is available and flexible for ubiquitous wearable devices.",

To address this, we introduce design models as a special class of conceptual models that support design processes for IS in general and UIS in particular. Design models for UIS are concise abstract conceptual models of key situations that conceive social, informational, physical, and service properties as requirements for targeted Information Systems. In this paper, we show how design models can be derived from narratives of key situations, guided by information systems ontologies, and domain specific input theories. This conceptual level offers an innovative approach for designing Ubiquitous Information Systems (UIS) in general and Healthcare Ubiquitous Information Systems (H-UIS) in particular. The proposed design approach is applied for developing H-UIS for reducing Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) by improving the communications between patients and healthcare professionals. Using the domain specific input theory of Health Promotion Model (HPM), the modeling guidelines for design models are generated and utilized in the development of a H-UIS to avoid ADEs. The H-UIS improves several processes involving information technologies for healthcare professionals. The system is empirically evaluated and results show high level of interest among users and initial positive adoption effects.

Low power transmissions are known to be very error prone. However, high reliability of communications is needed for several healthcare applications. It has been observed that the fluctuations of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) at the nodes of a BAN on a moving person show certain regularities and that the magnitude of these fluctuations are significant (5 – 20 dB). In this paper, we present BANMAC, a medium access control (MAC) protocol based on cross-layer design approach where medium access decisions are tightly integrated with physical layer conditions. BANMAC monitors and predicts the channel fluctuations and schedules transmissions opportunistically when the RSS is likely to be higher. We report the design and implementation details of BANMAC integrated with the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack. We present experimental data which show that the packet loss rate (PLR) of BANMAC is significantly lower as compared to that of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. For comparable PLR, the energy consumption of BANMAC is also significantly lower than that of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.",

Radio Frequency Identification or simply RFID has become an integral part of modern computing. RFID is notable in that it is the first practical technology to tightly couple physical entities and digital information. In this survey, we cater to the computing professional who is not familiar with the specifics of RFID, which we discuss in the context of supply chain management, its most popular application. We begin with a primer on supply chains, with particular reference to the relationship between efficiency and information flow. We recognize universal identification with bar codes and electronic data interchange as the two principle computing technologies that have played a central role in the optimization of supply chains. We then discuss RFID and supporting network technologies and identify their novel features and capabilities. We proceed by examining the performance improvements in supply chain management due to RFID and differentiate between different levels of tagging. We explore consumer applications and services using item-level RFID in particular. Such applications not only offer novel opportunities for business but also raise important social and policy challenges primarily related to privacy protection, which we discuss in more detail. We conclude by exploring how European law is attempting to address the new issues arising from the use of RFID and look ahead at the challenges encountered when computing with RFID before it can be made an effective end-user technology.",

While many papers in security focus on privacy and security technologies, few address the DR process, particularly for a Big Data system. However, all these studies that have investigated DR methods belong to the “single-basket” approach, which means there is only one destination from which to secure the restored data, and mostly use only one type of technology implementation. We propose a “multi-purpose” approach, which allows data to be restored to multiple sites with multiple methods to ensure the organization recovers a very high percentage of data close to 100%, with all sites in London, Southampton and Leeds data recovered. The traditional TCP/IP baseline, snapshot and replication are used with their system design and development explained. We compare performance between different approaches and multi-purpose approach stands out in the event of emergency. Data at all sites in London, Southampton and Leeds can be restored and updated simultaneously. Results show that optimize command can recover 1 TB of data within 650 s and command for three sites can recover 1 TB of data within 1360 s. All data backup and recovery has failure rate of 1.6% and below. All the data centers should adopt multi-purpose approaches to ensure all the data in the Big Data system can be recovered and retrieved without experiencing a prolong downtime and complex recovery processes. We make recommendations for adopting “multi-purpose” approach for data centers, and demonstrate that 100% of data is fully recovered with low execution time at all sites during a hazardous event as described in the paper.",

Despite their enormous potential, they are currently mostly used only to monitor single individuals. Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals. In this paper, C-SPINE, a framework for Collaborative BSNs (CBSNs), is proposed. CBSNs are BSNs able to collaborate with each other to fulfill a common goal. They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Specifically, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-specific protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as filtering, time-dependent data integration and classification. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multi-sensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals’ meeting.",

To meet these research challenges, we propose a novel TOP-N Gene-based Collaborative Filtering (GeneCF) algorithm based on Gi of patients. The GeneCF algorithm is aimed for matching more accurate recommendations about genes to the patients, with exceptional precision and coverage achieved. The GeneCF algorithm has been tested and evaluated on a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) gene expression database.

A single-step procedure was performed using commercial polymer films to develop laser-induced graphene which was used as electrodes in sensor patches for taste sensing purposes. The cost of these sensor patches is less than two dollars based on the requirement for low-cost polymer films and Kapton tapes for developing the sensor patches. Five different chemicals corresponding to the five fundamental tastes of sour, sweet, salty, bitter and umami were tested with the developed sensors. The electrical parameters of the circuitry formed between the electrode-electrolyte interfaces during the experimental procedure were obtained by using the complex non-linear least square curve fitting technique by fitting a simulation curve to the Cole–Cole curve obtained from the experimental results. The sensor patches operating on a capacitive principle, exhibited significant differences in terms of their impedimetric responses for the kinetic processes taking place during the experiments, with different concentrations for each chemical. Four different concentrations were tested for each chemical to analyze the performance of the sensor for that particular chemical. A comparison between the responses of the five chemicals for each concentration was done to inspect the differences between their responses. An analysis of the differences in the conductivity response by the sensor patch for the five chemicals at a specific concentration was also done. The sensor patches did not show any hysteresis in their output responses, while obtaining significant repeatability when testing the chemicals with them. The response time of the sensor patches was around two seconds with the recovery time is 10min for the sensor being thoroughly washed and dried in between experiments The obtained experimental results from these sensor patches and their low cost, and easy fabrication process make them promising for their utilization in taste sensing purposes.",

IDNet is the first system that exploits a deep learning approach as universal feature extractors for gait recognition, and that combines classification results from subsequent walking cycles into a multi-stage decision making framework. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art techniques, leading to misclassification rates (either false negatives or positives) smaller than 0.15% with fewer than five walking cycles.

We work under the hypothesis that a risk-prone situation produces sudden and significant deviations in standard physiological and behavioural user patterns. These changes can be captured by a group of sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate. We introduce a dataset, called PRIDE, which provides a baseline for the development and the fair comparison of personal risk detection mechanisms. PRIDE contains information on 18 test subjects; for each subject, it includes partial information about the user’s behavioural and physiological patterns, as captured by Microsoft Band©. PRIDE test subject records include sensor readings of not only when a subject is carrying out ordinary daily life activities, but also when exposed to a stressful scenario, thereby simulating a dangerous or abnormal situation. We show how to use PRIDE to develop a personal risk detection mechanism; to accomplish this, we have tackled risk detection as a one-class classification problem. We have trained several classifiers based only on the daily behaviour of test subjects. Further, we tested the accuracy of the classifiers to detect anomalies that were not included in the training process of the classifiers. We used a number of one-class classifiers, namely: SVM, Parzen, and two versions of Parzen based on k-means. While there is still room for improvement, our results are encouraging: they support our hypothesis that abnormal behaviour can be automatically detected.",

Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) is a widely used application nowadays. Through the services provided by such e-health systems, doctors can obtain the variation of patients’ conditions and make treatments quickly and accordingly. Recently, researchers have employed the Chebyshev chaotic maps in the authentication process of TMISs. Unfortunately, many kinds of security weaknesses such as off-line guessing attack, destitution of user anonymity and session key agreement happen in relative work. To overcome the disadvantages, we propose a secure remote authentication scheme employing the chaotic maps. We use the formal proof under random oracle model, and the famous verification tool Proverif to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Besides, informal analysis including ten security properties and performance comparison are shown to supplement the security properties. From the formal proof, we can see that the attacker has a negligible probability to crack the scheme over the active guessing attack. The formal verification demonstrates that our scheme can resist the attackers simulated by the tool Proverif. Moreover, we compare our scheme with several recent schemes, and the comparison results show that our scheme reaches the level of security requirements and also has suitable cost in performance. Thus, it is more applicable to telecare medicineenvironments.",

abstract = "Pulse wave collection from multi-points of radial artery under different static pressures is an essential method to diagnose diseases. However, there are some problems in the currently-used measuring instruments. Single-type sensor has limitations to pulse wave acquisition. It is not enough to set three sampling points to detect variation trend of radial artery pulse wave. Adaptation to different wrist surfaces and mutual interference of sensors are neglected. This paper proposes a novel flexible compound pressure sensor array for measuring radial artery pulse wave to overcome the problems mentioned above. Our compound pressure sensor consists of a piezoelectric sensor and a piezoresistive sensor which are used to measure pulse wave and static pressure separately. A bending structure of the sensor could guarantee the signal intensity and prevent the occurrence of inverted waveform. In this study, poroelastic materials are used to achieve flexible connection and decrease interference among sensors. In addition, the amplitude characteristics of pulse wave in radial artery are described and the arrangement and size of the sensor array is designed based on statistical data. Anti-interference, repeatability and validation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the sensor array. The results show that the flexible compound pressure sensor array not only reflects depth information of radial artery pulse wave under a wide range of static pressures, but also has good repeatability and anti-interference performance.",

Experiments on four datasets (Coil20, Extended YaleB, USPS, PIE), acquired conjunction with two classification architectures based on the overcomplete AISA features, show that the classification accuracy is mostly higher than those obtained from the other ICA related features and two other sparse representation features with a small number of training samples via nearest neighbor (NN) classification method.",

In the present paper, we propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multi-objective large-scale immune algorithm parallelized utilizing the message passing interface (MPI). The proposed algorithm comprises three layers: objective, group and individual layers. First, to tackle each objective in a multi-objective problem, a subpopulation is used for optimization, and an archive population is used to optimize all the objectives simultaneously. Second, the numerous variables are divided into several groups. Finally, individual evaluations are allocated across many core processing units, and calculations are performed in parallel. Consequently, the computation time is greatly reduced. The proposed algorithm integrates the idea of immune algorithms, exploring sparse areas in the objective space, and uses simulated binary crossover for mutation. The proposed algorithm is employed to optimize the 3D terrain deployment of a wireless sensor network, which is a self-organization network. In our experiments, through comparisons with several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms—the cooperative coevolutionary generalized differential evolution 3, the cooperative multi-objective differential evolution, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decision variable analyses and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III—the proposed algorithm addresses the deployment optimization problem efficiently and effectively.",

A novel and simple lossless source coding scheme, called PVA (Pre-processing and Valid word length Adaptive coding), is proposed for WDAS under limited communication bandwidth. The proposed coding scheme improves the utilization of communication bandwidth and realizes the real-time compression and transmission by the technique of common binary fields finding, repeating fields reducing and data stream recombination. PVA scheme also improves the precision of the measured signals compared to the normal oversampling method under the same bandwidth. It is thus effective for the applications which are in high demand of fidelity.

Then we calculate the error between the recovery output data and the input data. By judging the obtained error and the acceptable error, the SAECS model can choose autonomously the most appropriate sparsity and the most appropriate length of measurement vector. This SAECS model can then reconstruct the original signal that can satisfy the acceptable error requirement with the minimum length of measurement vector in CS theory. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method by using sampled pressure data from human body model.

Outdoor localization usually needs GPS as the core means and draws support from other sensors or methods.

However, there is an obvious gap between these two localization architectures. In this study, we devise an “IOS” (I ndoor, O utdoor, and S emi-open) detection system. For the lightweight need, a WiFi-based sub-detector is implemented. Using only WiFi sensor and a weak learner, the sub detector is easy to use and energy saving. For the precision demand, an aggregated IOS detector based on a semi-CRF (semi-Markov conditional random fields) algorithm is designed. The attribute of semi-CRF uncovers the interdependency between IOS states, so that it guarantees the accuracy of the detection. The evaluation results show that IOS detector can achieve an over 96% accuracy in tested environments. This detection technique holds the potential to realize the seamless localization from indoor to outdoor, and vice versa.",

In our model, global region statistics are utilized as segmentation criteria in order to classify regions with similar mean intensities but different variances. Additionally, we propose an edge indicator function based on a guided filter (instead of a Gaussian filter) that can preserve the underlying edges of the image obscured by noise. The proposed edge indicator function is integrated with non-convex regularization to overcome the influence of noise, resulting in more accurate segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed model utilizes a Markov random field to model the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels, which increases the robustness of the model under high-noise conditions.

PD-NOMA utilizes the power domain for user multiplexing, which allows users to share resources to increase the system spectral efficiency, so as to improve system throughput. In this paper, we introduce an PD-NOMA application scenario, i.e., supporting group communication in public safety network. Because of the power-difference requirements of users in the PD-NOMA system, for the group communications, the number of users who can share these resources is limited; and the cryptographic keys thus cannot be distributed to user equipment efficiently. To solve this problem, we investigate combining PD-NOMA and spatial multiplexing technologies to meet the demand for high spectral efficiency. That is, we present a scheme for combining PD-NOMA with space shift keying (SSK) modulation, namely PD-NOMA-SSK, to help meet the demand for high spectral efficiency by exploiting the additional spatial domain. At the same time, we also suggest that the system throughput can be further enhanced by using PD-NOMA-SSK with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiplexing technology. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed schemes by comparing them with the conventional SSK and MIMO multiplexing schemes.",

The raised alerts have to be analyzed to timely respond to the security incidents. Their analysis, however, is time-consuming and costly. This problem increases with the large number of alerts often raised by anomaly detection systems. To timely and effectively handle security incidents, alerts should be accompanied by information which allows the understanding of incidents and their context (e.g., root causes, attack type) and their prioritization (e.g., criticality level). Unfortunately, the current state of affairs regarding the information about alerts provided by existing anomaly detection systems is not very satisfactory. This work presents an anomaly analysis framework that facilitates the analysis of alerts raised by an anomaly detection system monitoring a database system. The framework provides an approach to assess the criticality of alerts with respect to the disclosure of sensitive information and a feature-based classification of alerts according to their associated type of attack. The framework has been deployed as a web-based alert audit tool that provides alert classification and risk-based ranking capabilities, significantly easing the analysis of alerts. We validate the classification and ranking approaches using synthetic data generated through an existing healthcare management system.",

Drug transmitters have limited resources in terms of energy and reservoir and these limitations should be taken into consideration when designing a drug delivery system. Drug molecules may also be expensive and releasing a large amount of them can have harmful effects on the healthy parts of the body. In this paper, we consider a multiple transmitter local drug delivery system in which the nearest transmitters to a randomly located tumor are activated to release drug molecules and guarantee the Least Effective Concentration (LEC) in every part of the tumor. We propose two different scenarios: a single transmitter drug delivery system for which the optimal rate of the transmitting nanomachine and the optimal density of deployed nanomachines are derived through formulations and simulations. Poisson distributed as well as regular square and hexagon grid deployments are investigated. We then extend it to a multiple transmitter drug delivery system for which the optimal allocated rate to each releasing transmitter is derived in order to minimize the total rate of release and maintain LEC in every part of the tumor. It is shown that activating multiple transmitters leads to a reduction in the total optimal release rate of drug molecules as well as improving the time duration between consecutive administrations.",

These nodes are small in size, operating on limited processing capabilities with scarce working memory and battery life and not very powerful radio transceivers. They can only communicate with each other through wireless media. Radio waves are insecure in nature; therefore, by using such waves for communication there are always opportunities for different attacks on the network. Most wireless techniques are founded on the cluster-based sensor network. Forwarding cluster head's (CHs) data in a secure manner is very important because CHs collect data from the cluster members and send it to the sink node or base station. For securing CH's data, we propose a mechanism termed ICMDS (Inter-Cluster Multiple Key Distribution Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks), which enables the securing of the entire network. In ICMDS, we use two phases of security implementations for the sensor node's authenticity while communicating with the CH. A recovery phenomena is also stated at the time when a CH ceases to function due to its high energy consumption.",

abstract = "Recent studies in nanotechnology show that the membrane selection process and distance adaptation algorithms can be used to maintain the simultaneous molecular communication in multi-user nanonetworks. However, such methods prevent the cooperation between different nanodevices, thus, degrade the performance. Moreover, the existing frameworks are not suitable for dense nanonetworks containing huge number of nano-devices. To the best of our knowledge, a simultaneous communication framework that enables cooperation has not been covered based on the challenges caused by the diffusion nature of the Concentration Shift Keying (CSK)-based molecular communication. First of all, the transmission of the molecular signal through all available channels is one of the most important challenge as it increases the interference between devices. Moreover, the experienced latency and attenuation of the chemical signal complicate the decoding process at the receiver side and necessitate a more complex nanomachine model. Additionally, synchronization between nanodevices becomes problematic. Having these challenges in mind, we propose an interference-free, simultaneous and selective communication model for Flow-Based Architecture (FBA)-based Nanonetwork. The proposed framework uses a molecule blocking filter structure that enables inter-group synchronization and limits the side effects of the diffusion nature. The packet-based communication is used in the proposed framework, and we defined a complete packet architecture that consists of synchronization bits, the address of the receiver and the data. The filters transmission control mechanism is also presented as a Markov chain-based active flow control structure. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated from both user perspective and network perspective. We observed that the proposed framework can support up to 8 simultaneous selective molecular communications in a 10-user nanonetwork.",

Instead of generating an FPGA configuration for a given arbitrary query during system runtime, we deploy a general query structure on the FPGA consisting of multiple small reconfigurable partitions (RP). During deployment of the hybrid database system, for each RP various query operators are prepared as reconfigurable modules (RM). At system runtime, the proposed approach dynamically chooses and reconfigures RMs into the RPs regarding a given query. As a result the reconfiguration overhead during system runtime is significantly reduced and enables the utilization of our hybrid architecture in real-world scenarios.",

The fuzzy noise removal method is composed of fuzzy noise detection and noise filtering. Region detection and degree detection are presented for fuzzy noise detection, and a modified weight median filter is proposed for filtering noise. Then the high-pass enhancement filter is introduced for image sharpening in the proposed homomorphic filtering method. A variety of degraded images and a real X-ray images have been handled by the proposed method, as well as the several existing methods. The comparisons of those experimental results show that the performance of our method overwhelms those of the existing ones.",

Cryptographer prefers to secure algorithms against known attacks; however designer focuses on efficient implementation. It has been established in several researches that an attack on implementation of a cipher requires far less effort than exploiting mathematical weakness of the structure. Implementation vulnerabilities are utilized by side channel attacks (SCA). In practical environment a block cipher is implemented in one of the modes of encryption like ECB, CBC, CTR. Our research focuses on finding leakage points in different modes of encryption including GCM to build hypothetical power consumption model for correlation power analysis (CPA) attack. CPA is simulated on AES-128-ECB in PIC18F4520 which yields secret key extraction in 2346 traces. Algorithmic level countermeasures for Counter mode and GCM mode are also presented. Proposed Counter and GCM mode implementation in FPGA yields 0.179% and 6.66% area overhead respectively. Authentication structure of proposed GCM is tolerant against fault injection attacks and propagates error with high probability. Single bit modifies approximately 51% bits in subsequent multiplications and disturbing the Tag by 48%.

In this paper, we survey different middleware approaches and propose MidSHM, a middleware for WSN-based SHM applications using the service-oriented architecture (SOA). SOA uses loosely coupled services that can be reused flexibly to develop different applications. MidSHM is a three-layered middleware with each of the layers containing various services that address issues such as in-network processing, fault tolerance, dynamicity, quality of service etc. We describe operations of various services and use two application examples to illustrate the usability and flexibility of MidSHM.

In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm named oriented cuckoo search algorithm (OCS) is designed. In OCS, the global search capability is dominated by the combination of two different random distributions. To provide a deep investigation, ten different random distributions are employed and compared with CEC2013 test suits. Numerical results show the hybrid distribution combined with Lévy distribution and Cauchy distribution achieves the best performance. Furthermore, OCS with this hybrid distribution is also incorporated into the methodology of DV-Hop algorithm to improve the precision performance.

Many useful functions of this theory, including sampling, aggregation, and plausibility, are integrated into the localization method. From there, the algorithm determines whether a set of given measurements belong to a particular county. Motivated by the flexible nature of Dempster-Shafer Theory, a multitude of network setups and combinations of available measurement features are tested to verify the performance of the proposed method. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained from extensive simulations.

Unfortunately, raw data and low level features cannot meet the video based task. In this paper, a semantic based model is proposed for representing and organizing video big data. The proposed surveillance video representation method defines a number of concepts and their relations, which allows users to use them to annotate related surveillance events. The defined concepts include person, vehicles, and traffic sighs, which can be used for annotating and representing video traffic events unambiguous. In addition, the spatial and temporal relation between objects in an event is defined, which can be used for annotating and representing the semantic relation between objects in related surveillance events. Moreover, semantic link network is used for organizing video resources based on their associations. In the application, one case study is presented to analyze the surveillance big data.",

Secondly, combining our state machines with the specific parameters of S-MAC, we propose an analytical probabilistic model to investigate the latency and stability performances of S-MAC employing three different mechanisms: without sleeping mechanism, with sleeping mechanism, and with adaptive-listening mechanism. Also we analyze the latency and stability performances of S-MAC with different dutyCycle values. This research shows two interesting results: 1) Sleeping mechanism inside S-MAC does have negative impacts on its latency and stability; fortunately, adaptive listening mechanism can optimize them to some extent. 2) Latency and stability performances of S-MAC can be further improved through manipulating dutyCycle values.

Variations in face image due to change in illumination, expression and presence of occlusions along with aging present many challenges to face recognition system. In this paper a new approach to robust face recognition using Polar FFT features modeled as symbolic data is proposed. Initially the face segment is cropped from the image using Viola-Jones algorithm and is converted into gray scale image of size 120 × 120 pixels. 2D-DFT is performed on pre-processed image. The dominant magnitude of 2D-DFT coefficients are computed using polar fourier transform technique and are represented as 1D P-FFT. The magnitude that represents maximum value in 1D P-FFT is considered as a feature value. The extracted feature value is used to construct a symbolic object to represent a face image. Further, a new symbolic similarity measure is devised and employed for assigning test symbolic object to a face class. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with AR database and an average accuracy of 96.25% is achieved. 100% and 97% verification rate is achieved on the ORL and LFW face databases respectively. The various experiments conducted on AR, ORL and LFW databases using the proposed symbolic data modeling approach shows that this method has a very high degree of recognition and is better compared to some of the recently reported face recognition techniques.",

Finding the optimal performance settings typically requires investigating all possible combinations of design parameters, while the number of required experiments increases exponentially for each considered design parameter.

In particular, the paper applies the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm implemented in the SUrrogate MOdeling (SUMO) toolbox inside a wireless testbed. Moreover, to cope with the unpredictable nature of wireless testbeds, the paper applies an experiment outlier detection which monitors outside interference and verifies the validity of conducted experiments. The proposed techniques are implemented and evaluated in a wireless testbed using a realistic wireless conferencing scenario. The performance gain and experimentation time of a SUMO optimized experiment is compared against an exhaustively searched experiment. In our proof of concept, it is shown that the proposed SUMO optimizer reaches 99.79% of the global optimum performance while requiring 8.67 times less experiments compared to the exhaustive search experiment.",

Since these threats are seldom reported, people are not much aware of them. Existing surveys on Bluetooth security outline only a few threats without much illustration and categorization. In this paper, we have performed a comprehensive survey to identify major security threats in Bluetooth communication and presented them with illustrations. Although Bluetooth device manufacturers are doing their part to keep the technology secure, the users should also be aware of these security threats and take a minimum level of precaution. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of existing threats in Bluetooth technology and suggest probable solutions.",

Mobile e-health applications provide users and healthcare practitioners with an insightful way to check users/patients’ status and monitor their daily activities. This paper proposes a cloud-based mobile e-health calorie system that can classify food objects in the plate and further compute the overall calorie of each food object with high accuracy. The novelty in our system is that we are not only offloading heavy computational functions of the system to the cloud, but also employing an intelligent cloud-broker mechanism to strategically and efficiently utilize cloud instances to provide accurate and improved time response results. The broker system uses a dynamic cloud allocation mechanism that takes decisions on allocating and de-allocating cloud instances in real-time for ensuring the average response time stays within a predefined threshold. In this paper, we further demonstrate various scenarios to explain the workflow of the cloud components including: segmentation, deep learning, indexing food images, decision making algorithms, calorie computation, scheduling management as part of the proposed cloud broker model. The implementation results of our system showed that the proposed cloud broker results in a 45% gain in the overall time taken to process the images in the cloud. With the use of dynamic cloud allocation mechanism, we were able to reduce the average time consumption by 77.21% when 60 images were processed in parallel.",

Currently, many methods need to deploy a large number of reference tags beforehand and some are limited by antennas’ spacing. Further, the signal propagation along Non-Line of Sight introduces multipath effects which will challenge the accuracy of RFID localization system. In this work, we propose a method based on measured phase to track mobile RFID tags with millimeter level (mm-level) accuracy. We first partition the surveillance region into square grids at mm-level and suppose that there is a virtual tag as the same as the tracked one in each grid. On this basis, for the case where the tags move along a known track with constant speed, we only need to locate the tag's initial position. We leverage phase periodicity to obtain some candidates and then eliminate position ambiguity by double difference true phase. And for the case where the tag's moving track is unknown to the system, we adopt a first-order Taylor series expansion to calculate the relative displacements of the tracked tag and then locate the initial position as the same process as tracking the known trajectory. In our experiment, our solution can achieve a mean error distance of 0.26cm and 0.55cm for known and unknown movement tracks respectively.",

Empirical experiments on two different datasets including a LinkedIn dataset and movie star dataset show that the proposed method is effective and accurate. Different from the manually generated annotation repository such as Wikipedia and LinkedIn, the proposed method can automatically mine the semantic relation between entities and does not need any prior knowledge such as ontology or the hierarchical knowledge base.

Web applications have become the most popular way to deliver essential services to customers, and the increasing dependency of individuals on web applications makes them an attractive target for adversaries. The adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the database-driven applications to craft injection attacks which include SQL, XQuery and XPath injections. A large amount of work has been done on identification of SQL injection vulnerabilities resulting in several tools available for the purpose. However, a limited work has been done so far for the identification of XML injection vulnerabilities and the existing tools only identify XML injection vulnerabilities which could lead to a specific type of attack. Hence, this work proposes a black-box fuzzing approach to detect different types of XQuery injection vulnerabilities in web applications driven by native XML databases. A prototype XQueryFuzzer is developed and tested on various vulnerable applications developed with BaseX as the native XML database. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the prototype is effective against detection of XQuery injection vulnerabilities. Three new categories of attacks specific to XQuery, but not listed in OWASP are identified during testing.",

abstract = "The challenging problem of time synchronization in wireless sensor networks is considered in this paper, where a new distributed protocol is proposed for both local and multi-hop synchronization. The receiver-to-receiver paradigm is used, which has the advantage of reducing the time-critical-path and thus improving the accuracy compared to common sender-to-receiver protocols. The protocol is fully distributed and does not rely on any fixed reference. The role of the reference is divided amongst all nodes, while timestamp exchange is integrated with synchronization signals (beacons). This enables fast acquisition of timestamps that are used as samples to estimate relative synchronization parameters. An appropriate model is used to derive maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for both the offset-only, and the joint offset/skew estimation. The model permits to directly estimating relative parameters without using or referring to a reference’ clock. The proposed protocol is extended to multi-hop environment, where local synchronization is performed proactively and the resulted estimates are transferred to the intermediate/end-point nodes on-demand, i.e. as soon as a multi-hop communication that needs synchronization is initiated. On-demand synchronization is targeted for multi-hop synchronization instead of the always-on global synchronization model, which avoids periodic and continuous propagation of synchronization signals beyond a single-hop. Extension of local MLE estimators is proposed to derive relative multi-hop estimators. The protocol is compared by simulation to some state-of-the-art protocols, and results show much faster convergence of the proposed protocol. The difference has been on the order of more than twice compared to CS-MNS, more than ten times compared to RBS, and more than twenty times compared to TPSN. Results also show scalability of the proposed protocol concerning the multi-hop synchronization. The error does not exceed few microseconds for as much as 10 hops in R4Syn, while in CS-MNS, and TPSN, it reaches few tens of microseconds. Implementation and tests of the protocol on real sensor motes confirm microsecond level precision even in multi-hop scenarios, and high stability (long lifetime) of the skew/offset model.",

abstract = "The minimum-latency broadcast problem in duty-cycled wireless sensor networks has received significant attention over the last few years. A common approach for the problem is to assign collision-free transmitting times to forwarding nodes for disseminating a message from one source node to all other nodes according to their given duty-cycle schedules and transmission ranges. However, preventing collision for all transmissions may increase latency in the broadcast schedules. This paper proposes a novel strategy of Collision-Tolerant Scheduling (CTS) that offers an opportunity to reduce broadcast latency by allowing collisions at non-critical nodes to speed up the broadcast process for critical ones. The completion of broadcast scheduling, i.e. all nodes receive a broadcast message, is ensured by additionally transmitting the message to non-critical nodes experiencing collision. We employ the scheduling strategy in two proposed broadcast schemes: Degree-based CTS (DCTS) and MIS-based CTS (MCTS), which select forwarding nodes based on the node degree and maximal independent set information, respectively. The results of both theoretical analysis and simulation reveal the remarkable advantages of CTS in minimizing broadcast latency in duty-cycled WSNs. DCTS and MCTS guarantee approximation ratios of (Δ−1)T and 12T in terms of broadcast latency, where Δ and T denote the maximum node degree and the number of time slots in a working period, respectively. The two schemes reduce to at least 94 percent of the broadcast latency compared with existing schemes, while slightly increasing the number of transmissions due to the additional transmissions. Thanks to the latency reduction, the proposed schemes require 93 percent less energy than existing ones.",

Generally, in order to increase the predictive accuracy and reliability, as many factors or features as possible are considered and added to the regression model, however, this leads to the poor efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability. Besides, some existing methods associated with support vector regression (SVR) usually require us to solve the convex quadratic programming problem with a higher computational complexity. In this paper, we proposed a novel two-phase multi-kernel SVR using linear programming method (MK-LP-SVR) for feature sparsification and forecasting so as to solve the aforementioned problems. The multi-kernel learning method is mainly utilized to carry out feature sparsification and find the important features by computing their contribution to forecasting while the whole model can be used to predict output values for given inputs. Based on a simulation, 6 small, and 6 big data sets, the experimental results and comparison with SVR, linear programming SVR (LP-SVR), least squares SVR (LS-SVR), and multiple kernel learning SVR (MKL-SVR) showed that our proposed model has considerably improved predictive accuracy and interpretability for the regression forecasting on the independent test sets.",

By upgrading end-users to prosumers (producer+consumer) and involving them in the process of service creation, both service consumers and service providers can benefit from a cheaper, faster, and better service provisioning. The EU-IST research project OPUCE (Open Platform for User-Centric Service Creation and Execution) aims at building a unique service environment by integrating recent advances in networking, communication and information technology where personalized services can be dynamically created and managed by prosumers. This paper particularly discusses the design and development of a service repository, which is at the very core of the OPUCE platform. The repository consists of two main components: a fully functioned XML registry supporting facet-based access to service descriptions, and a novel semantic service browser that supports prosumers who are not technically experienced to explore and discover services in an intuitive and visualized manner. We demonstrate the benefits of our design by conducting usability and performance studies.",

We can estimate the WCET only after establishing the micro-architecture of the ASIP. At the same time, an ASIP micro-architecture can be derived only knowing the assignment of tasks to ASIP. To address this circular dependency, we propose an Uncertainty Model for the WCETs, which captures the performance of tasks running on a range of possible ASIP implementations.

By using a wireless charging vehicle (WCV) to periodically recharge each sensor node’s battery, a wireless sensor network may remain operational forever. In this paper, we aim to jointly optimize a dynamic multi-hop data routing, a traveling path (for the WCV to visit all the sensor nodes in a cycle), and a charging schedule (charging time for each sensor node) such that the ratio of the WCV’s vacation time over the cycle time can be maximized. The key challenge of this problem (caused by time-varying data routing) is the integration and differentiation terms in problem formulation, which yields a very challenging non-polynomial program. To remove these non-polynomial terms, we introduce the concept of (N+1)-phase solution, which adopt a special dynamic routing scheme. We prove that an optimal (N+1)-phase solution can achieve the same objective value as that by an optimal time-varying solution. We further prove that the optimal traveling path must follow the shortest Hamiltonian cycle. Finally, we linearize the problem for data routing and charging schedule and thus obtain an optimal solution in polynomial-time.",

abstract = "Context
One of the main targets of cyber-attacks is data exfiltration, which is the leakage of sensitive or private data to an unauthorized entity. Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field.
Objective
This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research.
Method
We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers.
Results
We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest).
Conclusion
This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures. We assert the need for developing such an evaluation framework.",

A tool is developed for producing test videos with hazardous content, and then those test videos are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm, as well as an existing post-processing tool that is currently being used for detecting such patterns. To perform the detection in real time, the proposed algorithm was implemented on a dual core processor, using a pipelined/parallel software architecture. Results indicate that the proposed method provides better detection performance, allowing for the masking of seizure inducing patterns in real time.",

By applying the working mechanism of the biological immune system to the event-driven dynamic clustering algorithm for WSNs, where event as antigen, the records of clusters and routing paths of past events in the node׳s memory as antibodies, antibodies have the function of collecting and preserving memories, as such it is convenient to response to antigens that are similar to the previous antigen timely. When similar events happen and satisfy the affinity and energy rules, the sensor nodes can directly call antibodies in the memory to build clusters of events and transfer data quickly. Besides, we change the cycle of the network dynamically according to the updating cluster cycle rule. The proposed RDICMR algorithm saves a lot of energy in the process of building clusters and data transmission, increases the amount of data transmission and prolongs the lifetime of the network.",

abstract = "Cooperative cyberdefense has been recognized as an essential strategy to fight against cyberattacks. Cybersecurity Information Sharing (CIS), especially about threats and incidents, is a key aspect in this regard. CIS provides members with an improved situational awareness to prepare for and respond to future cyberthreats. Privacy preservation is critical in this context, since organizations can be reluctant to share information otherwise. This is particularly critical when CIS is facilitated through an untrusted infrastructure provided by a third party (e.g., the cloud). Despite this, current data formats and protocols for CIS do not guarantee any form of privacy preservation to participants. In this paper we introduce PRACIS, a scheme for CIS networks that guarantees private data forwarding and aggregation. PRACIS leverages the well-known Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) standard data format. Remarkably, PRACIS can be seamlessly integrated with existing STIX-based message brokering middleware such as publish-subscribe architectures. PRACIS achieves these goals by combining standard format-preserving and homomorphic encryption primitives. We discuss experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation developed for a subset of STIX. Results show that entities may create up to 689 incidents per minute, far beyond the estimated average of 81. Moreover, aggregation of 104 incidents can be carried out in just 2.1 s, and the transmission overhead is just 13.5 kbps. Overall, these results suggest that the costs incurred by PRACIS are easily affordable in real-world scenarios.",

EGMM integrates GMM with Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the best K value for GMM and filter the LOS signal set accurately. The experiment is conducted with iBeacon devices, and the average error distance of EGMM can be enhanced as 64% of those generated by existing Gaussian filtering. The average positioning error of EGMM is about 0.48 m, which is adequate for indoor positioning.",

Mainly, dc is used to calculate the density of each data point and to identify the border points in the clusters. CFSFDP necessitates using different methods for estimating the densities of different datasets and the estimation of dc largely depends on subjective experience. To overcome the limitations of CFSFDP, this paper presents a method for CFSFDP via heat diffusion (CFSFDP-HD). CFSFDP-HD proposes a nonparametric method for estimating the probability distribution of a given dataset. Based on heat diffusion in an infinite domain, this method accounts for both selection of the cutoff distance and boundary correction of the kernel density estimation.

Secure data transmission is crucial for the real-time and exact control of active distribution networks. However, traditional data encryption methods have difficulty with the real-time control and mass data transmission of the active distribution networks. Additionally, content filtering based on text classification has a strong dependence on the size and type of data. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel distributed content filtering algorithm based on data labeling and policy expression (DCF-DLPE). In DCF-DLPE, we design a secure private protocol with data labeling and build a policy rule expression. Four representative datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The comparative results show that for the larger dataset, DCF-DLPE outperforms the DES, AES (256-bit) and Blowfish encryption methods in the average time-consumption. Experimental results also show that compared with text classification algorithms, DCF-DLPE has a clear advantage in terms of filtering accuracy, sensitivity and precision. It is more important that, compared with text classification algorithms, performance of the DCF-DLPE algorithm is independent of the size and type of the dataset.",

In practical use, partial least squares-based gene selection approaches can obtain gene subsets of good qualities, but are considerably time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to integrate partial least squares based recursive feature elimination (PLS–RFE) with two feature elimination schemes: simulated annealing and square root, respectively, to speed up the feature selection process. Inspired from the strategy of annealing schedule, the two proposed approaches eliminate a number of features rather than one least informative feature during each iteration and the number of removed features decreases as the iteration proceeds. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches, we perform extensive experiments on six publicly available microarray data with three typical classifiers, including Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest-Neighbor and Support Vector Machine, and compare our approaches with ReliefF, PLS and PLS–RFE feature selectors in terms of classification accuracy and running time. Experimental results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches accelerate the feature selection process impressively without degrading the classification accuracy and obtain more compact feature subsets for both two-category and multi-category problems. Further experimental comparisons in feature subset consistency show that the proposed approach with simulated annealing scheme not only has better time performance, but also obtains slightly better feature subset consistency than the one with square root scheme.",

First, using a hierarchical tree-based structure supporting parallel processing and efficient feature descriptors, irrelevant shapes are pruned and a subset of shapes relevant to the query is selected, then using more sophisticated feature descriptors, accurate retrieval is performed. Contour representation of an object is considered as most significant visual shape similarity measure by the humans. Using boundary information, we generate two simplified and efficient feature descriptors for fast pruning, and a sophisticated feature descriptor for effective and accurate retrieval. Tests performed on standard datasets unveil that the proposed technique is computationally more efficient than the state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining comparable matching and retrieval performance. Its performance is scalable for huge datasets and is robust against affine transformations, articulations and occlusion.",

abstract = "One of the main problems of working with metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors in wireless sensor networks is power consumption. Duty-cycling, i.e., switching off the power of the gas sensor and minimizing the node’s active time is a well-known power saving technique. But the initial action period of the gas sensor after it is switched back on imposes a lower limit on the active time, and therefore a limit on the power savings. The length of a sensor’s initial action period depends on atmospheric conditions, but values of several tens of seconds or even minutes are common. In this paper a correction technique is presented which enables measurements taken during the sensor’s initial action period to be used, thus allowing the node’s active time to be reduced to less than that period. To check the validity of the proposed correction, the responses of two sensors are compared, one continuously powered and the other switched on and off. When the correction is applied to the switched sensor’s response, there appears a trade-off between sensor precision and power consumption. The measurements taken with the two sensors after 5s of power-on time are strongly correlated (r2=0.95).",

Although a number of current avionics systems follow federated architectures, the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) paradign is becoming the dominant style in the more modern developments. The reason is that the IMA concept promotes modular designs where applications with different levels of criticality can execute in an isolated manner in the same hardware. This approach complies with the requirements of cost, safety, and weight of the avionics systems. FACE standard (Future Airborne Capability Environment) defines the architectural baseline for easing integration in avionics systems, including the communication functions across distributed components. As specified in FACE, middleware will be integrated into avionics systems to ease development of portable components that can interoperate effectively. This paper describes the usage of publish-subscribe middleware (precisely, DDS – Data Distribution Service for real-time systems) into a fully distributed partitioned system. We describe, from a practical point of view, the integration of the middleware communication overhead into the hierarchical scheduling (as compliant with ARINC 653) to allow the usage of middleware in the partitions. We explain the design of a realiable communication setting, exemplified on a distributed monitoring application in a partitioned environment. The obtained implementation results show that, given the stable communication overhead of the middleware, it can be integrated in the time windows of partitions.",

In addition, our method can identify targeting genes while eliminating redundant ones in an efficient way. We use ten publicly available microarray datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that our method can handle gene selection effectively.

abstract = "As one of the most popular research topics, sparse representation and dictionary learning technique has received an increasing amount of interest in recent years. Sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been shown to be an effective method and produce impressive performance on face recognition. SRC directly used the entire set of training samples as the dictionary for sparse coding. Recent research has shown that learning a dictionary from the training samples instead of using a predefined one can produce state-of-the-art results. However, all of these dictionary learning methods are designed to achieve low classification errors and implicitly assumes that the losses of all misclassification are the same. In many real-world face recognition applications, this assumption may not hold as different misclassifications could lead to different losses. Motivated by this concern, in this paper we propose a cost-sensitive dictionary learning algorithm for SRC, by which the designed dictionary is able to produce cost-sensitive sparse coding, resulting in improved classification performance in such scenarios. Our method considers the cost information during the sparse coding stages. Specifically, we introduce a new “cost” penalizing matrix and enforce the cost-sensitive requirement throughout the learning process. The optimal solution is efficiently obtained following the alternative optimization method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The NGIC comprises a cooperative control unit (CCU), an enhanced control unit (ECU), an inhibited control unit (ICU) and an auxiliary control unit (ACU). To shorten the rise time of the process variable, the ECU first takes effect with a rapid step action when the set-point changes or a large error appears. After a prescribed time, the ICU takes effect with an opposite step action to reduce the system overshoot or to avoid oscillation. When the control system achieves a prescribed steady state or the control time exceeds a pre-defined limitation, the ACU becomes effective to improve the control precision of the NGIC by applying a central proportional law with a guided final control output. As a super managing unit, the CCU coordinates all the work of the ECU, the ICU and the ACU to make the NGIC eliminate the control error with short rise time, small overshoot and short settling time. To testify the control performance of the NGIC, we apply the NGIC to a bio-reactor process with large time variation. The simulation results indicate that the NGIC has better control performance than the conventional PID, internal model controller (IMC) and artificial neural network (ANN) controller. Hence, the NGIC is significant to improve the control effect for some complex practical processes.",

It provides dynamic, on-demand and scalable resources that enable the processing of complex workflow-based experiments. With the ever growing size of the experimental data and increasingly complex processing workflows, the need for reproducibility has also become essential. Provenance has been thought of a mechanism to verify a workflow and to provide workflow reproducibility. One of the obstacles in reproducing an experiment execution is the lack of information about the execution infrastructure in the collected provenance. This information becomes critical in the context of Cloud in which resources are provisioned on-demand and by specifying resource configurations. Therefore, a mechanism is required that enables capturing of infrastructure information along with the provenance of workflows executing on the Cloud to facilitate the re-creation of execution environment on the Cloud. This paper presents a framework to Reproduce Scientific Workflow Execution using Cloud-Aware Provenance (ReCAP), along with the proposed mapping approaches that aid in capturing the Cloud-aware provenance information and help in re-provisioning the execution resource on the Cloud with similar configurations. Experimental evaluation has shown the impact of different resource configurations on the workflow execution performance, therefore justifies the need for collecting such provenance information in the context of Cloud. The evaluation has also demonstrated that the proposed mapping approaches can capture Cloud information in various Cloud usage scenarios without causing performance overhead and can also enable the re-provisioning of resources on Cloud. Experiments were conducted using workflows from different scientific domains such as astronomy and neuroscience to demonstrate the applicability of this research for different workflows.",

This work proposes the concept of the Virtual Machine (VM) cluster migration, meaning that services could be migrated to various clouds based on different constraints such as computational resources and better economical offerings. Since cloud services are instantiated as VMs, an application can be seen as a cluster of VMs that integrate its functionality. We focus on the VM cluster migration by exploring a more sophisticated method with regards to VM network configurations. In particular, networks are hard to managed because their internal setup is changed after a migration, and this is related with the configuration parameters during the re-instantiation to the new cloud platform. To address such issue, we introduce a Software Defined Networking (SDN) service that breaks the problem of network configuration into tractable pieces and involves virtual bridges instead of references to static endpoints. The architecture is modular, it is based on the SDN OpenFlow protocol and allows VMs to be paired in cluster groups that communicate with each other independently of the cloud platform that are deployed. The experimental analysis demonstrates migrations of VM clusters and provides a detailed discussion of service performance for different cases.",

Besides this paper, for the first time, proposes the idea to take advantage of the predicted class labels of the training samples for classification of the test sample, it devises a weighted fusion scheme to fuse the predicted class labels of the training sample and test sample. The paper also interprets the rationale of MMSEC. As MMSEC generalizes better than conventional MSE, it can lead to more robust classification decisions.

The network is modeled as a connected weighted and undirected graph. Infeasible and suboptimal edges are discarded first by preprocessing techniques to reduce the processing complexity of the algorithm. Then the edges of the graph are processed based on a dynamic graph algorithm, which can maintain a single-source shortest path tree for the online edge deletions, such that total costs can be minimized while ensuring the delay-constraint and the tree structure.

We thus propose a strategy to analyze users’ interactions in dynamic networks where entities act according to their interests and activity dynamics. Our strategy, named Random rElationship ClASsifier sTrategy (RECAST), allows classifying users interactions, separating random ties from social ones. To that end, RECAST observes how the real system differs from an equivalent one where entities’ decisions are completely random. We evaluate the effectiveness of the RECAST classification on five real-world user contact datasets collected in diverse networking contexts. Our analysis unveils significant differences among the dynamics of users’ wireless interactions in the datasets, which we leverage to unveil the impact of social ties on opportunistic routing. We show that, for such specific purpose, the relationships inferred by RECAST are more relevant than, e.g., self-declared friendships on Facebook.",

Specifically, we propose a 3D context-based object tracking method that learns a set of 3D context key-points, which have spatial–temporal co-occurrence correlations with the tracked object, for collaborative tracking in binocular video data. We first learn 3D context key-points via the spatial–temporal constrain in their spatial and depth coordinates. Then, the position of the object of interest is determined by a probability voting from the learnt 3D context key-points. Moreover, with depth information, a simple yet effective occlusion handling scheme is proposed to detect occlusion and recovery.

abstract = "Identifying malicious users in online social networks (OSNs) is a challenging task that demands a great deal of skill and knowledge because these users can have multiple forms: Sybils, bots, spammers, phishers, impersonations or fake accounts. Different types of research methodologies have been proposed to solve this problem; hence, there are varied solutions. Most of the work on OSNs has focused on trust, distrust to detect and preventing these types of attacks. Some researchers have found that a suspected node can generate private/public keys to prevent its identity from being stolen by an adversary; however, they have not explained how these keys are generated and managed. We propose a new and efficient centralized key management protocol to prevent Sybil attack and to provide a secure communication service among users in OSNs. The core tenet of this method is the existence of a ‘roadblock’ that any user intending to join a group must go through, which includes a task that only a human user can accomplish. Hence, automatically controlled accounts are prevented from joining, and the group will consist only of users that have been confirmed as genuine. The mechanism is very effective in recognizing bot accounts, which enables it to guard the network against malicious behavior by fake accounts.",

Then, we investigate, report, and highlight the state-of-the-art research efforts directed at IoT from a security perspective. A taxonomy is devised by classifying and categorizing the literature based on important parameters (e.g., threats, requirements, IEEE standards, deployment level, and technologies). Furthermore, a few credible case studies are outlined to alert people regarding how seriously IoT devices are vulnerable to threats. We enumerate the requirements that need to be met for securing IoT. Several indispensable open research challenges (e.g., data integrity, lightweight security mechanisms, lack of security software’s upgradability and patchability features, physical protection of trillions of devices, privacy, and trust) are identified and discussed. Several prominent future research directions are provided.",

But the most current remote attestation mechanisms cannot achieve real-time trust attestation of sensing nodes and cannot track the node, if the node is an untrusted one, and these mechanisms also have poor environmental adaptability, so the current remote attestation mechanisms are not suitable for the sensing layer nodes in the Internet of Things. To solve the above problems, a remote attestation mechanism for the sensing layer nodes in the Internet of Things is presented in this paper. Firstly, the formal description of the sensor nodes is given; secondly, based on the formal description, a real-time trust measurement for the sensing nodes is proposed and the real-time trust measurement for the sensing nodes is realized; thirdly by encapsulating the properties and trust value of sensing node, the real-time tracing of the trust of nodes are realized in data transmission process. The security of this mechanism is proved in the standard model, meanwhile, this mechanism will not expose the privacy of nodes in the process of attestation, and it can trace the untrusted nodes. The simulation experiment shows that this mechanism can resist the attacks to the sensing nodes and can effectively improve the trust rate of data transmission, and this mechanism has good dynamic adaptability to network environment. This mechanism is simple and efficient, meanwhile the mechanism is flexible and easy to implement.",

This methodology can recognize the specific technologies with development potential in the eyewear industry, and identify holders of key relevant patents. This study finds that consumers value functions including motion tracking, reminders, eye state detection, and non-eye disease detection. Key technologies with development potential for satisfying customer demand include eyewear, communications protocols, and sensors. Thus, embedding micron-scale sensors directly into contact lenses to monitor user physiological data can satisfy customer demand and is considered as emerging technology in the smart eyewear industry. Furthermore, patent portfolios of these technologies vary among different countries and regions, with the US and EU focusing on eye tracking, motion tracking, and identity verification, while China focuses on eye fatigue detection, distance measurement, and wireless frequency technologies.

One step further is achieving Continuous Authentication (CA), i.e., ensuring that the user remains the same during a certain period. The hardness of this task varies with the attacker characterization, that is, the amount of information about the attacker that is available to the authentication system. In this vein, we explore different ECG-based CA mechanisms for known, blind-modelled and unknown attacker settings. Our results show that, under certain configuration, 99.5 % of true positive rate can be achieved for a blind-modelled attacker, 93.5 % for a known set of attackers and 91.8 % for unknown ones.",

The novel technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) connects objects to the Internet and its most advanced applications refine obtained data for the user. We propose that Internet of Things technology can be used to promote basic nursing care in the hospital environment by improving the quality of care and patient safety.
Objectives
To introduce the concept of Internet of Things to nursing audience by exploring the state of the art of Internet of Things based technology for basic nursing care in the hospital environment.
Data sources and review methods
Scoping review methodology following Arksey & O’Malley’s stages from one to five were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of current literature. We searched eight databases using predefined search terms. A total of 5030 retrievals were found which were screened for duplications and relevancy to the study topic. 265 papers were chosen for closer screening of the abstracts and 93 for full text evaluation. 62 papers were selected for the review. The constructs of the papers, the Internet of Things based innovations and the themes of basic nursing care in hospital environment were identified.
Results
Most of the papers included in the review were peer-reviewed proceedings of technological conferences or articles published in technological journals. The Internet of Things based innovations were presented in methodology papers or tested in case studies and usability assessments. Innovations were identified in several topics in four basic nursing care activities: comprehensive assessment, periodical clinical reassessment, activities of daily living and care management.
Conclusions
Internet of Things technology is providing innovations for the use of basic nursing care although the innovations are emerging and still in early stages. Internet of things is yet vaguely adopted in nursing. The possibilities of the Internet of Things are not yet exploited as well as they could. Nursing science might benefit from deeper involvement in engineering research in the area of health.",

The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector, their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards its propagation is presented.",

To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications. Our survey is different from existing surveys in that we focus on recent advances and ongoing research directions in cognitive radio in the context of Machine to Machine and Internet of Things. We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity. This paper intends to help new researchers entering the domain of CR and IoT by providing a comprehensive survey on recent advances.",

COMFIT is composed of two different modules: (1) the App Development Module, a model-driven architecture (MDA) infrastructure, and (2) the App Management and Execution Module, a module that contains cloud-based web interface connected to a server hosted in the cloud with compilers and simulators for developing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The App Development Module allows the developers to design IoT applications using high abstraction artifacts (models), which are tailored to either the application perspective or the network perspective, thus creating a separation between these two concerns. As models can be automatically transformed into code through the App Development Module, COMFIT creates an environment where there is no need of additional configurations to properly compile or simulate the generated code, integrating the development lifecycle of IoT applications into a single environment partially hosted in the client side and partially in the cloud. In its current version, COMFIT supports two operating systems, namely Contiki and TinyOS, which are widely used in IoT devices. COMFIT supports automatic code generation, execution of simulations, and code compilation of applications for these platforms with low development effort. Finally, COMFIT is able to interact with IoT-lab, an open testbed for IoT applications, which allows the developers to test their applications with different configurations without the need of using local IoT devices. Several evaluations were performed to assess COMFIT’s key features in terms of development effort, quality of generated code, and scalability.",

While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).",

abstract = "This paper presents Everything-as-a-Resource (*aaR) as a paradigm for designing collaborative applications on the Web. Abstracting these applications’ various physical and logical entities, resources are defined in a way that permits their discovery, composition, and participation in business scenarios. Compared to Everything-as-a-Service (*aaS), resources are categorized into computational, consumed, and produced, have trackable lifecycles as per their respective category, and are customized in order to consider the characteristics of future resource-based collaborative applications to develop. From a capacity perspective, a computational resource processes data, a produced resource abstracts data, and a consumed resource captures data. Along with their capacities, resources expose methods that other resources and/or applications’ stakeholders call. The proper call of methods is ensured through restrictions like limited and non-shareable. This paper exemplifies the *aaR paradigm with a case study that revolves around the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the healthcare domain. The case study is implemented in a RESTful fashion along with some standard Web technologies and protocols. The evaluation of IoTR4HealthCare system is benchmarked against two existing systems using cost and latency criteria.",

To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented to experimentally analyze and compare the resource efficiency of different SAT verification approaches in terms of a number of performance metrics, including computation and communication overhead.",

In this sense, key features such as traceability, unique identification, energy efficiency, heterogeneity of devices, scalability and ubiquity, are necessary at the network structure for efficient performance of IoT applications. As a single technology, it is not capable to provide all these features, then, the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) arises as an important approach for these solutions. In this paper, a framework aiming to provide the network features required for IoT applications is proposed, considering the challenges that comes from the integration of these two technologies. In this framework, two components are considered, the Fuzzy Q-Algorithm and the Fuzzy System-Based Route Classifier. The former comprises a fuzzy system to enhance an anti-collision protocol for RFID, and the latter is a fuzzy system that classifies routes and assists routing protocols in applications that use WSNs and RFID. Experiments show that framework provides the following benefits: improves the performance of RFID tags identification, lowers packet loss rates, decreases the nodes energy consumption, and shows improvements in network load balancing. Moreover, these benefits provide greater energy efficiency and quality of service for IoT applications.",

Introducing efficient mechanisms for collecting, processing, and delivering data generated by sensors, medical equipment, wearable devices, and humans, is a key enabling factor for advanced healthcare services. The adoption of IoT in smart health, however, opens the doors to some security concerns. In fact, by considering the confidentiality and sensitivity of medical data, a healthcare system must fulfill advanced access control procedures with strict security and data quality requirements. To this end, a flexible policy enforcement framework, based on the IoT paradigm, is defined hereby. It is able to face security and quality threats in dynamic large scale and heterogeneous smart hearth environments. As a key feature of the proposed framework, cross-domain policies have been defined using a specification language based on XML. In this way, it becomes possible to ease the management of interactions across different realms and policy conflicts. Moreover, to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, a running example, based on a smart health application, is detailed throughout the manuscript. This helps to highlight the different facets of the conceived enforcement framework. A preliminary performance analysis also demonstrates its feasibility in large scale environments.",

The approach is realized as a language for describing GUIs, interpreters for rendering GUIs, and a graphical tool for creating and editing GUIs. The work is evaluated in a number of research projects in the domain of e-health; we conclude that the GUI language is practically viable for building professional-grade GUIs. Furthermore, the presented editor is compared directly to a market leading product in a controlled experiment. From this, we conclude that the editor is accessible to new users, and that it can be more efficient to use than the commercial alternative.",

The adoption of IoT in medical care field will bring great convenient to both doctors and patients for effective illness monitoring and diagnosis. Due to the high value of medical data and the openness character of health IoT, the protection of data confidentiality is of crucial importance. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed secure data management with keyword search system for health IoT. Since the patients are usually managed by diverse medical institutions, the proposed system enables distributed access control of protected health information (PHI) among different medical domains. On the other hand, the accumulation of electronic health records (EHR) makes effective data retrieval a challenge task. Our scheme could provide efficient keyword search function on cross-domain PHI. For the resource limited devices in health IoT, it is an essential requirement to design lightweight algorithms in the secure data management system. The proposed system realizes lightweight data encryption, lightweight keyword trapdoor generation and lightweight data recovery, which leaves very few computations to user's terminal. The security of this system is reduced to the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The comparison analysis is made between this scheme and other existing systems. The extensive experiments on both laptop and smart phone platforms show that the proposed scheme has greatly improved the computation efficiency and requires much less communication cost.",

abstract = "This paper seeks to provide some explanation as to how demand-, supply- and institutions-related factors in China have affected the creation and diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT)-related products and services. Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms—and underperforms—the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.",

As such, computer systems may store a huge amount of information, which makes data analysis and storage a challenge. Information aggregation and correlation are two basic mechanisms to reduce the problem size, for example by filtering out redundant data or grouping similar one. These processes require high processing capabilities, and thus their application in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios is not straightforward due to resource constraints. Furthermore, privacy issues may arise when the data at stake is personal. In this paper we propose PAgIoT, a Privacy-preserving Aggregation protocol suitable for IoT settings. It enables multi-attribute aggregation for groups of entities while allowing for privacy-preserving value correlation. Results show that PAgIoT is resistant to security attacks, it outperforms existing proposals that provide with the same security features, and it is feasible in resource-constrained devices and for aggregation of up to 10 attributes in big networks.",

The proclaimed goal of metadata collection is to support the quality of service, thus enhancing the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To most users, it is not obvious that metadata express people’s lives to a large degree. Traditionally, security has focused on protecting communication content rather than the metadata associated with it. This provides a thin layer of privacy protection. Thus, a demand exists for privacy-preserving technologies that prevent metadata collection and aggregation. This paper focuses on a service’s ability to observe communication metadata that can be exploited to learn users’ identities and behavior patterns. Thus, a novel system, Misty Clouds, is proposed as a platform for creating anonymous Internet connections to address both security and performance issues. The performance evaluation shows that the desired level of anonymity can be achieved with tolerable performance overheads. Through a comparison analysis, it is shown that the new algorithm outperforms an existing algorithm, Tor. Additionally, the features that can facilitate the growth of Misty Clouds into a holistic privacy-preserving platform are discussed. Furthermore, a user survey was conducted to study users’ perceptions and attitudes.",

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

Yet, the wide adoption of this promising vision, especially for application areas such as pervasive health care, assisted living, and smart cities, is hindered by severe privacy concerns of the individual users. Hence, user acceptance is a critical factor to turn this vision into reality. To address this critical factor and thus realize the cloud-based Internet of Things for a variety of different application areas, we present our comprehensive approach to privacy in this envisioned setting. We allow an individual user to enforce all her privacy requirements before any sensitive data is uploaded to the cloud, enable developers of cloud services to integrate privacy functionality already into the development process of cloud services, and offer users a transparent and adaptable interface for configuring their privacy requirements.",

The concept of the Internet of Things and Services envisions physical devices and appliances to be used as easily as a web service and seamlessly integrated into networked applications with required functionality. Technologically this concept is clear, and several smart applications are currently under development (see e.g. iCore, Hydra, Confidence or IoT@Work projects). However, the business perspective of information as an asset in its own right remains an open issue. To handle this issue we apply an originally value-based requirement technique, e3-value, to model value creation and value exchange within an e-business network of multiple business actors. Using this approach the business activity can be reduced to its core elements, which in the simplest case comprise the value proposition, distribution channels and the customers of the company, explaining how a multi-actor network creates, distributes and consumes value by production of a good or providing a service.",

Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudIoT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudIoT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudIoT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms–both proprietary and open source–and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet.",

This study aims at analyzing the influence of the IIoT on these business models from a business level perspective. In particular, it focuses on the interrelationships between business model component changes. While the sparse body of extant management literature examines just a subset of business model elements as affected by the IIoT, a framework comprising an entire set of elements is provided. Besides, their direct and indirect interrelationships, and the most important changes in each of the elements, are investigated. For this purpose, an exploratory multiple case study approach is employed, which is based on relevant IIoT-related experiences of 76 German manufacturing companies. By triangulating data from semi-structured expert interviews and archival company material, the study provides in-depth insights and a better understanding of IIoT-driven effects on manufacturing business models. It contributes to extant management literature by revealing the value proposition, internal infrastructure management, and customer relationships predominantly influenced by the IIoT. Moreover, it is shown that IIoT-triggered business model changes are offer-driven, particularly by production and process optimization within customers' production systems. These value proposition changes result in subsequent modifications of the remaining business model elements.",

In this paper, the objective is to find temporal patterns whose true prevalence values vary similar to a reference support time sequence satisfying subset constraints through estimating temporal pattern support bounds and using a novel fuzzy dissimilarity measure.

Although Bluetooth LE specification targets a specific set of applications mainly devoted to monitoring purposes, innovative solutions can lead to the adoption of such technology in different applications, such as multimedia streaming, allowing IoT objects to exploit new functionalities. In this direction this article presents BlueVoice, an application targeted to Bluetooth LE devices to enable speech streaming services. In the article BlueVoice is presented by first detailing the services set extension needed to support the new envisioned multimedia service, then a description of application choices is given, followed by an evaluation of its performance in real IoT objects. Thanks to the selected speech encoding technique, connection design choices and packetization strategies, BlueVoice application requires a communication bandwidth of 64.3 kbps to transmit audio at 16 kHz in ADPCM format. BlueVoice performance has been evaluated in terms of power consumption, memory and processing requirements, showing feasibility of the developed solution in resource constrained devices, thus confirming the correct choices in the application design. The set of performance information obtained show that BlueVoice is a viable solution to enable speech communications in ubiquitous wireless IoT nodes based on the Bluetooth LE technology.",

Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed.

Because of the increasing number of elderly and disabled people, there is an urgent need for a real-time health monitoring infrastructure for analyzing patients’ healthcare data to avoid preventable deaths. Healthcare Industrial IoT (HealthIIoT) has significant potential for the realization of such monitoring. HealthIIoT is a combination of communication technologies, interconnected apps, Things (devices and sensors), and people that would function together as one smart system to monitor, track, and store patients’ healthcare information for ongoing care. This paper presents a HealthIIoT-enabled monitoring framework, where ECG and other healthcare data are collected by mobile devices and sensors and securely sent to the cloud for seamless access by healthcare professionals. Signal enhancement, watermarking, and other related analytics will be used to avoid identity theft or clinical error by healthcare professionals. The suitability of this approach has been validated through both experimental evaluation, and simulation by deploying an IoT-driven ECG-based health monitoring service in the cloud.",

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.",

Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art PPDA techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of PPDA techniques.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) is about making “things” smart in some functionality, and connecting and enabling them to perform complex tasks by themselves. The functionality can be encapsulated as services and the task executed by composing the services. Two noteworthy functionalities of IoT services are monitoring and actuation. Monitoring implies continuous executions, and actuation is by triggering. Continuous executions typically involve stream processing. Stream input data are accumulated into batches and each batch is subjected to a sequence of computations, structured as a dataflow graph. The composition may be processing several batches simultaneously. Additionally, some non-stream OLTP transactions may also be executing concurrently. Thus, several composite transactions may be executing concurrently. This is in contrast to a typical Web services composition, where just one composite transaction is executed on each invocation. Therefore, defining transactional properties for executions of IoT service compositions is much more complex than for those of conventional Web service compositions. In this paper, we propose a transaction model and a correctness criterion for executions of IoT service compositions. Our proposal defines relaxed atomicity and isolation properties for transactions in a flexible manner and can be adapted for a variety of IoT applications.",

In this paper, we propose a routing protocol for Emergency Response IoT based on Global Information Decision (ERGID) to improve the performances of reliable data transmission and efficient emergency response in IoT. Specifically, we design and realize a mechanism called Delay Iterative Method (DIM), which is based on delay estimation, to solve the problem of ignoring valid paths. Moreover, a forwarding strategy called Residual Energy Probability Choice (REPC) is proposed to balance the load of network by focusing on the residual energy of node. Simulation results and analysis show that ERGID outperforms EA-SPEED and SPEED in terms of end to end (E2E) delay, packet loss and energy consumption. Additionally, we also carry out some practical experiments with STM32W108 sensor nodes, and observe that ERGID can improve the real-time response ability of network.",

This paper aims at enhancing DQ in IoT by providing an overview of its state-of-the-art. Data properties and their new lifecycle in IoT are surveyed. The concept of DQ is defined and a set of generic and domain-specific DQ dimensions, fit for use in assessing IoT's DQ, are selected. IoT-related factors endangering the DQ and their impact on various DQ dimensions and on the overall DQ are exhaustively analyzed. DQ problems manifestations are discussed and their symptoms identified. Data outliers, as a major DQ problem manifestation, their underlying knowledge and their impact in the context of IoT and its applications are studied. Techniques for enhancing DQ are presented with a special focus on data cleaning techniques which are reviewed and compared using an extended taxonomy to outline their characteristics and their fitness for use for IoT.

Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model.",

Without losing its generality, the method discussed is experimentally evaluated in the paradigm of the Health domain. The focus is on the need for an overview of available data formats and transmission methods and selection of the optimal combination, which can result to reduction/minimization of costs.

A systematic literature review identified four key privacy themes that represent issues related to the collection of individuals' data through the IoT: unauthorised surveillance, uncontrolled data generation and use, inadequate authentication and information security risks. These four themes are used to critically analyse the Australian Privacy Principle's (APPs) protection of individual data. Findings indicate that (1) the APPs do not adequately protect individual privacy of data collected through the IoT, and (2) future privacy legislation must consider the implications of global reach of IoT services, and ubiquity and security of IoT data collection with respect to individual privacy.",

Our approach, called Geographical Routing for Mobile Tourist (GRMT), selects a route that is best served with medical centers, and goes through the path that is as shortest as possible in regards with the distance. We have modeled and simulated the proposed approach using simulation program. Simulated experimental results show that GRMT allows tourists to select geographical routes that are served with the highest number of close medical centers although the selected route is slightly longer in distance.",

It becomes more challenging for the emerging users because of scarcity of bandwidth. To overcome the unforbidden challenges in the advanced technologies like smart cities, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio provides the solution to achieve high throughput and continuous connectivity for reliable communication. A primary challenge in the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is the identification of dependable Data Channels (DCHs) for Secondary Users (SUs) communication amongst the available channels, and the continuation of communication when the Primary Users (PUs) return. The objective of every SU is to intelligently choose reliable DCHs, thereby ensuring reliable connectivity and successful transfer of data frames across the cognitive networks. The proposed Reliable, Intelligent and Smart Cognitive Radio protocol consumes less computational time and transmits energy with high throughput, as compared to the benchmark Cognitive Radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocols. This paper provides new applications of CR technology for IoT and proposes new and effective solutions to the real challenges in CR technology that will make IoT more affordable and applicable.",

Information retrieved from such an object, turns it into a potential smart object, certainly able to auto identify itself and, if security problems are suitably treated, most probably able to connect to the global Internet. This way, one can get an ubiquitous framework to access, monitor and control any of those smart objects over an Internet of connected things.

The use of smart phones with Internet access, along with strong security concerns - such as authenticity, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, entity authentication and non-repudiation - turn this whole context into a decentralized and mobile healthcare system. Using the simple IoT architecture presented, combining smart objects, the security solution and mobile communications, one may remotely take care of patients’ well being, establishing an ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living for Mobile Health applications.

abstract = "Micro-controllers such as Arduino are widely used by all kinds of makers worldwide. Popularity has been driven by Arduino’s simplicity of use and the large number of sensors and libraries available to extend the basic capabilities of these controllers. The last decade has witnessed a surge of software engineering solutions for “the Internet of Things”, but in several cases these solutions require computational resources that are more advanced than simple, resource-limited micro-controllers. Surprisingly, in spite of being the basic ingredients of complex hardware–software systems, there does not seem to be a simple and flexible way to (1) extend the basic capabilities of micro-controllers, and (2) to coordinate inter-connected micro-controllers in “the Internet of Things”. Indeed, new capabilities are added on a per-application basis and interactions are mainly limited to bespoke, point-to-point protocols that target the hardware I/O rather than the services provided by this hardware. In this paper we present the Arduino Service Interface Programming (ASIP) model, a new model that addresses the issues above by (1) providing a “Service” abstraction to easily add new capabilities to micro-controllers, and (2) providing support for networked boards using a range of strategies, including socket connections, bridging devices, MQTT-based publish–subscribe messaging, discovery services, etc. We provide an open-source implementation of the code running on Arduino boards and client libraries in Java, Python, Racket and Erlang. We show how ASIP enables the rapid development of non-trivial applications (coordination of input/output on distributed boards and implementation of a line-following algorithm for a remote robot) and we assess the performance of ASIP in several ways, both quantitative and qualitative.",

This paper introduces the IoT technology for use in the emergency management community. Considering the information required for supporting three sequential and distinct rhythms in emergency response operations: mobilization rhythm, preliminary situation assessment rhythm, and intervention rhythm, the paper proposes a modified task-technology fit approach that is used to investigate how the IoT technology can be incorporated into the three rhythms and enhance emergency response operations. The findings from our research support our two hypotheses: H1: IoT technology fits the identified information requirements; and H2: IoT technology provides added value to emergency response operations in terms of obtaining efficient cooperation, accurate situational awareness, and complete visibility of resources.",

Since IoT are always related to user’s daily life or work, the privacy and security are of great importance. The pervasive, complex and heterogeneous properties of IoT make its security issues very challenging. In addition, the large number of resources-constraint nodes makes a rigid lightweight requirement for IoT security mechanisms. Presently, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a popular solution to achieve secure data transmission, storage and sharing in the distributed environment such as IoT. However, the existing ABE schemes are based on expensive bilinear pairing, which make them not suitable for the resources-constraint IoT applications. In this paper, a lightweight no-pairing ABE scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed to address the security and privacy issues in IoT. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the ECDDH assumption instead of bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption, and is proved in the attribute based selective-set model. By uniformly determining the criteria and defining the metrics for measuring the communication overhead and computational overhead, the comparison analyses with the existing ABE schemes are made in detail. The results show that the proposed scheme has improved execution efficiency and low communication costs. In addition, the limitations and the improving directions of it are also discussed in detail.",

In this paper, an analysis of MAC and routing protocols for IoT is provided with focus on the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the IETF RPL standards. It is shown that existing routing metrics do not account for the complex interactions between MAC and routing, and thus novel metrics are proposed. This enables a protocol selection mechanism for selecting the routing option and adapting the MAC parameters, given specific performance constraints. Extensive analytical and experimental results show that the behavior of the MAC protocol can hurt the performance of the routing protocol and vice versa, unless these two are carefully optimized together by the proposed method.",

abstract = "A new form of computation is being evolved to include massive number of diverse set of conventional computing systems, sensors, devices, equipments, software and information services and apps. This new form of computing environment is known as the “Internet-of-Things” (IoT). The adoption of IoT is fast and the “things” are becoming integral part of people day-to-day life as well as essential elements in the businesses everyday activities and processes. Open characteristics of IoT environments raises privacy concern as “things” are autonomous with some degree of authority to sharing their capabilities and knowledge to fulfil their individual or collective tasks. As such privacy becomes central and an inherit computational aspect of the “things”. The work presented here is based on modelling IoT as Cooperative Distributed Systems (CDS). It proposes a novel approach of analysing and modelling privacy concepts and concerns. Privacy protection is captured as a form of “sensitive information” management at the interaction level. A privacy protection management framework for CDS at the interaction level is proposed. The application of the framework has been demonstrated by extending Contract Net Protocol (CNP) to support privacy protection for CDS.",

abstract = "Current advancements and growth in the arena of the Internet of Things (IoT) is providing great potential in the novel epoch of healthcare. The future of healthcare is expansively promising, as it advances the excellence of life and health of humans, involving several health regulations. Continual increases of multifaceted IoT devices in healthcare is beset by challenges, such as powering IoT terminal nodes used for health monitoring, data processing, smart decisions, and event management. In this paper, we propose a healthcare architecture which is based on an analysis of energy harvesting for health monitoring sensors and the realization of Big Data analytics in healthcare. The rationale of the proposed architecture is two-fold: (1) comprehensive conceptual framework for energy harvesting for health monitoring sensors; and (2) data processing and decision management for healthcare. The proposed architecture is a three-layered architecture that comprises: (1) energy harvesting and data generation; (2) data pre-processing; and (3) data processing and application. The proposed scheme highlights the effectiveness of energy-harvesting based IoT in healthcare. In addition, it also proposes a solution for smart health monitoring and planning. We also utilized consistent datasets on the Hadoop server to validate the proposed architecture based on threshold limit values (TLVs). The study demonstrates that the proposed architecture offers substantial and immediate value to the field of smart health.",

abstract = "The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where a selection of appropriate features and High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently select features and analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.",

There is a main requirement that make a wireless protocol ideal for use in the IoT, that is the energy efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has a high potential in becoming an important technology for the IoT in low power, low cost, small devices. However, specific techniques can be used in such a way as to further reduce the energy consumption of BLE. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic based mechanism that determine the sleeping time of field devices in a home automation environment based on BLE. The proposed FLC determines the sleeping time of field devices according to the battery level and to the ratio of Throughput to Workload (Th/Wl). Simulation results reveal that using the proposed approach the device lifetime is increased by 30% with respect to the use of fixed sleeping time.",

abstract = "Case-Based Learning (CBL) has become an effective pedagogy for student-centered learning in medical education, which is founded on persistent patient cases. Flippped learning and Internet of Things (IoTs) concepts have gained significant attention in recent years. Using these concepts in conjunction with CBL can improve learning ability by providing real evolutionary medical cases. It also enables students to build confidence in their decision making, and efficiently enhances teamwork in the learing environment. We propose an IoT-based Flip Learning Platform, called IoTFLiP, where an IoT infrastructure is exploited to support flipped case-based learning in a cloud environment with state of the art security and privacy measures for personalized medical data. It also provides support for application delivery in private, public, and hybrid approaches. The proposed platform is an extension of our Interactive Case-Based Flipped Learning Tool (ICBFLT), which has been developed based on current CBL practices. ICBFLT formulates summaries of CBL cases through synergy between students' and medical expert knowledge. The low cost and reduced size of sensor device, support of IoTs, and recent flipped learning advancements can enhance medical students' academic and practical experiences. In order to demonstrate a working scenario for the proposed IoTFLiP platform, real-time data from IoTs gadgets is collected to generate a real-world case for a medical student using ICBFLT.",
