abstract = "Enormous potential of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology has made it feasible to perceive and analyze real time health conditions in ubiquitous manner. Moreover, incorporation of IoT in healthcare industry has led researchers around the world to develop smart applications like mobile healthcare, health-aware recommendations, and intelligent healthcare systems. Inspired from these aspects, this research presents an intelligent healthcare framework based on IoT Technology to provide ubiquitous healthcare to person during his/her workout sessions. The intelligence of the presented framework lies with its ability to analyze real time health conditions during workouts and predict probabilistic health state vulnerability. For predictive purpose, the proposed framework indulges the utilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which is comprised of three phases namely, monitor, learn, and predict. In addition to this, the presented framework is supported by a mathematical foundation to predict probabilistic vulnerability, in terms of Probabilistic State of Vulnerability (PSoV). In order to determine the validity and applicability of the proposed framework, experiments were performed where 5 people with different attributes are monitored for 14 days using numerous smart sensors. Results, upon comparison with various state-of-the-art techniques, depict that the proposed system is superior in performance and is highly effective in delivering healthcare services during workouts.",

abstract = "The term of Internet of Things (IoT) remarkably increases the ubiquity of the internet by integrating smart object-based infrastructures. How to achieve efficient fine-grained data access control while preserving data privacy is a challenge task in the scenario of IoT. Despite ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) can provide fine-grained data access control by allowing the specific users whose attributes match the access policy to decrypt ciphertexts. However, existing CP-ABE schemes will leak users’ attribute values to the attribute authority (AA) in the phase of key generation, which poses a significant threat to users’ privacy. To address this issue, we propose a new CP-ABE scheme which can successfully protect the user’s attribute values against the AA based on 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer technique. In addition, we use Attribute Bloom Filter to protect the attribute type of the access policy in the ciphertext. Finally, security and efficiency evaluations show that the proposed scheme can achieve the desired security goals, while keeping comparable computation overhead.",

A systematic literature review identified four key privacy themes that represent issues related to the collection of individuals' data through the IoT: unauthorised surveillance, uncontrolled data generation and use, inadequate authentication and information security risks. These four themes are used to critically analyse the Australian Privacy Principle's (APPs) protection of individual data. Findings indicate that (1) the APPs do not adequately protect individual privacy of data collected through the IoT, and (2) future privacy legislation must consider the implications of global reach of IoT services, and ubiquity and security of IoT data collection with respect to individual privacy.",

Radio Frequency IDentification, putting an identification label into every object, enables a smart system to get information, either real-time or virtual-linked information, without any physical contact. Information retrieved from such an object, turns it into a potential smart object, certainly able to auto identify itself and, if security problems are suitably treated, most probably able to connect to the global Internet. This way, one can get an ubiquitous framework to access, monitor and control any of those smart objects over an Internet of connected things. RFID tags in medical context enable a rapid and precise identification of each smart entity, enabling a ubiquitous and quick access to Personal Health Records over an Internet of Things. The use of smart phones with Internet access, along with strong security concerns - such as authenticity, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, entity authentication and non-repudiation - turn this whole context into a decentralized and mobile healthcare system. Using the simple IoT architecture presented, combining smart objects, the security solution and mobile communications, one may remotely take care of patients’ well being, establishing an ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living for Mobile Health applications.

abstract = "Progress in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is shaping more and more the healthcare domain. ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

abstract = "The term IoT emerging services is used to refer to the modern kinds of services that IoT can provide to enhance service and experience quality by reducing complexity, speeding up requests, and using techniques involved with cloud, Big Data, and protocols to allows services to function seamlessly. Therefore, IoT utilises protocols found within different network layers. RPL or Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks is one of the most important routing protocols utilised on the network layer. This protocol is considered an IPV6 distance vector proactive routing protocol. The trickle timer algorithm is one of its major components. This algorithm is used to control and track the control messages’ flow throughout the network. However, one weakness of the trickle algorithm is that it suffers from short listen problem that makes some nodes starve for delay and long latency in propagating transmissions. Based on existing literature, there have been several research studies on this trickle method. Development of the Enhanced Trickle algorithm (E-Trickle) was done to get rid of the listen only period. However, there still is relatively low activity on studying the trickle algorithm’s performance merits. Our proposed elastic trickle timer algorithm will try to fill this gap by dealing only with the listen to only period problems. The power consumption and convergence time are mainly affected. Therefore, our proposed algorithm was incorporated in the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Different network densities were used to evaluate the simulation experiments. Its implementation was done on 20, 40, 60, and 80 nodes using different ratios for reception success (RX) (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%), and grid network and random topologies were used. The Cooja 2.7 simulator was used to implement the simulation experiments, and RPL performance was studied through the elastic trickle timer algorithm. Measurement of the simulation experiments was done on various performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), convergence time, and power consumption. Comparison of the results was done using the standard trickle timer algorithm. Using random and grid topologies, the results revealed greater enhancements in terms of convergence time. Simulation results revealed that when the network was made up of 20 nodes, there was 35% less convergence time. Moreover, when 40 nodes were randomly placed, there was 62% less convergence time, and 71% less convergence time when 40 nodes were situated in a grid topology. Additionally, there was 70% less convergence time when the network was made up of 60 nodes and approximately 76% less convergence time when there were 80 nodes. Moreover, the simulation results revealed that in terms of energy consumption, the new algorithm exhibited superior performance characteristics.",

Popularity has been driven by Arduino’s simplicity of use and the large number of sensors and libraries available to extend the basic capabilities of these controllers. The last decade has witnessed a surge of software engineering solutions for “the Internet of Things”, but in several cases these solutions require computational resources that are more advanced than simple, resource-limited micro-controllers. Surprisingly, in spite of being the basic ingredients of complex hardware–software systems, there does not seem to be a simple and flexible way to (1) extend the basic capabilities of micro-controllers, and (2) to coordinate inter-connected micro-controllers in “the Internet of Things”. Indeed, new capabilities are added on a per-application basis and interactions are mainly limited to bespoke, point-to-point protocols that target the hardware I/O rather than the services provided by this hardware. In this paper we present the Arduino Service Interface Programming (ASIP) model, a new model that addresses the issues above by (1) providing a “Service” abstraction to easily add new capabilities to micro-controllers, and (2) providing support for networked boards using a range of strategies, including socket connections, bridging devices, MQTT-based publish–subscribe messaging, discovery services, etc. We provide an open-source implementation of the code running on Arduino boards and client libraries in Java, Python, Racket and Erlang. We show how ASIP enables the rapid development of non-trivial applications (coordination of input/output on distributed boards and implementation of a line-following algorithm for a remote robot) and we assess the performance of ASIP in several ways, both quantitative and qualitative.",

The term Internet of Things was originated from a vision strongly coupled with supply-chain concerns and RFID tagged objects. However the idea of such Internet of Things has evolved in a wider sense, referring now to a ubiquitous object society combining RFID, sensor networks and pervasive computing technologies. This scenario involves different requirements such as heterogeneity and dynamicity of objects, sensors, applications and protocols as well as the need for allowing the dynamic evolution of such applications. These issues seemed to be easily addressed if the principles of service-oriented computing (SOC), like loose coupling and heterogeneity, are used for constructing such architectures and applications. In this paper we underline what benefits SOC can offer to constructing a middleware for the Internet of Things. These concepts have been applied in a service-oriented middleware that tries to leverage the existing Internet of Things architectural concepts by using SOC principles in order to bring more flexibility and dynamicity. We describe the approaches used in that middleware and the lessons learned from that experience.

While the number of IoT service users has increased dramatically, little is understood about what motivates the continued use of such services. The primary objective of this study is to develop and refine a conceptual framework from the perspective of network externalities and privacy to provide a theoretical understanding of the motivations that drive continued use of IoT services. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 508 users concerning their perceptions of IoT services. The results indicate network externalities play a significant role in influencing consumers' perception of usage benefits and thus adoption, whereas privacy concerns have a relatively weak effect on adoption. Implications for IS researchers and practice are discussed.",

The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet.

The architectural prototype for smart student healthcare is designed for application scenario. The results are computed after processing the health measurements in a specific context. In our case study, systematic student perspective health data is generated using UCI dataset and medical sensors to predict the student with different disease severity. Diagnosis schemes are applied using various state-of-the-art classification algorithms and the results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure.

The process of acquiring, analysing and managing data obtained by sensors and actuators in industrial environments can benefit from modern Cloud-based platforms towards a complete implementation of the Industrie 4.0 concept. The analysis of huge data sets produced by these sensors (Big Data) could allow quick and accurate decision making. For example, productivity improvements can be achieved by analysing device performance and degradation for real-time feedback on configuration and optimization. This work proposes a Cloud-based architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) applications to improve the deployment of smart industrial systems based on remote monitoring and control. By using specific technologies available as a service, we demonstrate the proposed architecture on an automated electric induction motor use case. This approach includes layers for sensor network data gathering, data transformation between standard protocols, message queuing, real-time data analysis, reporting for further analysis, and real-time control. Particularly, by using the proposed architecture, we remotely monitored, controlled and processed data produced by sensors and actuators coupled to the motor. Preliminary results indicate this foundation can support predictive methods and management of automated systems in the Industrie 4.0 context.",

In this context, we present a system that enables PHDs to share information in home networks and with the Internet based on a new Internet of Things protocol, namely the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is used along with the IEEE 11073 family of standards, which is the main exchange data model for PHD communication. We discuss how the proposed system can be integrated to other connected health systems, such as a Universal Plug and Play healthcare system. We detail how the CoAP communication model was adapted to the IEEE 11073 model. We also present a real PHD prototype and its evaluation results. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution, showing how its network overhead is around 50% lighter when compared to other protocols. Finally, we tested the proposed solution based on different scenarios, including a proof-of-concept integration with a service in the cloud, using different wireless physical interfaces.",

This paper introduces the IoT technology for use in the emergency management community. Considering the information required for supporting three sequential and distinct rhythms in emergency response operations: mobilization rhythm, preliminary situation assessment rhythm, and intervention rhythm, the paper proposes a modified task-technology fit approach that is used to investigate how the IoT technology can be incorporated into the three rhythms and enhance emergency response operations. The findings from our research support our two hypotheses: H1: IoT technology fits the identified information requirements; and H2: IoT technology provides added value to emergency response operations in terms of obtaining efficient cooperation, accurate situational awareness, and complete visibility of resources.",

As wireless internet has spread widely over the world, it can be readily used to communicate information related to, for example, human health. Indeed, some institutes have demonstrated the measurement of physical vital signals (e.g., temperature, pulse, and heartbeat) of the body for monitoring through a smartphone. However, biochemical analytes such as proteins and bacteria are currently difficult to measure based on antigen-antibody binding due to several technological barriers. Among them, the terminal unit of detection for, for instance, pathogens is mostly bulky, insensitive, or even expensive for sophisticated devices. We have studied the use of CMOS image sensor (CIS) for detecting the signal produced from an immuno-analytical system, which could resolve the detection issue hindering monitoring via IoT. In this study, an immunosensor system using CIS for detection means was fabricated to pocket-sized dimensions and then employed for determining a food-borne pathogen, the Vibrio species, in real samples. The analysis was controlled and monitored using a smartphone that was also used to upload the result as data to the internet server for sharing with the public. To our knowledge, this study could be the first exemplification of pathogen monitoring via IoT in the field of healthcare.",

abstract = "The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where a selection of appropriate features and High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently select features and analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.",

abstract = "Big data, Internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing have been recognized a family of technologies for a connected world. Besides hailed hope for the future, there are also challenges to security due to complexity and unpredictability of the Internet, clouds, and data. One of the challenges is information and data exchange, for example, identifying untrustworthy cloud users and analyzing abnormal user behavior during information exchange. This paper addresses exchange mechanism, which is a useful theoretic basis to make secure electronic commerce and electronic business transactions possible. To ensure and verify the property of fairness, a crucial property of exchange mechanism, this paper proposes a specific model for behavior analysis based on the extensive game with imperfect information. Rationality and fairness properties are built in the corresponding game and the game tree. To verify the properties, a tree analysis method is proposed, and a linear time algorithm is given. As a case study, some flaws of the ASW protocol are found.",

In the context of big data, the success of healthcare applications solely depends on the underlying architecture and utilization of appropriate tools as evidenced in pioneering research attempts. Novel research works have been carried out for deriving application specific healthcare frameworks that offer diversified data analytical capabilities for handling sources of data ranging from electronic health records to medical images. In this paper, we have presented various analytical avenues that exist in the patient-centric healthcare system from the perspective of various stakeholders.

abstract = "Healthcare applications in IoT systems have been receiving increasing attention because they help facilitate remote monitoring of patients. In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system.",

Also, existing protocols suffer from a number of deficiencies such as insecure or inefficient identification techniques, throughput delay and inadaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel identification technique based on a hybrid approach (group-based approach and collaborative approach) and security check handoff (SCH) for RFID systems with mobility. The proposed protocol provides customizability and adaptability as well as ensuring the secure and scalable deployment of an RFID system to support a robust distributed structure such as the IoT. The protocol has an extra fold of protection against malware using an incorporated malware detection technique. We evaluated the protocol using a randomness battery test and the results show that the protocol offers better security, scalability and customizability than the existing protocols.",

The aim is to ensure the security of patients’ healthcare data, realize access control for normal and emergency scenarios, and support smart deduplication to save the storage space in big data storage system. The medical files generated by the healthcare IoT network are encrypted and transferred to the storage system, which can be securely shared among the healthcare staff from different medical domains leveraging a cross-domain access control policy. The traditional access control technology allows the authorized data users to decrypt patient’s sensitive medical data, but also hampers the first-aid treatment when the patient’s life is threatened because the on-site first-aid personnel are not permitted to get patient’s historical medical data. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. In normal application, the healthcare staff with proper attribute secret keys can have the data access privilege; in emergency application, patient’s historical medical data can be recovered using a password-based break-glass access mechanism. To save the storage overhead in the big data storage system, a secure deduplication method is designed to eliminate the duplicate medical files with identical data, which may be encrypted with different access policies. A highlight of this smart secure deduplication method is that the remaining medical file after the deduplication can be accessed by all the data users authorized by the different original access policies. This smart healthcare big data storage system is formally proved secure, and extensive comparison and simulations demonstrate its efficiency.",

abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

Therefore, the sink node which based on embedded multi-core SoC for IoTs and maximizing its computing performance has brought into focus in recent years. In this paper, we design a multi-core Task-Efficient Sink Node (TESN) based on heterogeneous architecture and the Weighted-Least Connection (WLC) task schedule strategy has been proposed to improve its efficiency. There are two types of cores in the sink node, master core and slave cores. The master core deals with tasks allocation and the seven slave cores deal with data processing. All of the cores are communicating with each other through mailbox. By considering each core’s real-time processing information and computing performance, the proposed WLC can balance each core’s load and reduce network congestion. The XilinxV5 platform is used to evaluate the performance of WLC and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms for multi-core sink node. The experiment results show that the WLC strategy improves the processing speed obviously, achieves load balance and avoids large scale congestion of sink node in the sensor networks of IoTs.",

Design of an engineering system, which is typically a multi-domain system, can become complicated due to its complex structure and possible dynamic coupling between domains. An integrated and concurrent approach should be considered in the design process, in particular in the conceptual and detailed design phases. In the context of multi-domain design, attention has been given recently to such subjects as multi-criteria decision making, multi-domain modeling, evolutionary computing, and genetic programing. More recently, machine condition monitoring has been considered for integration into a scheme of design evolution even though many challenges exist for this to become a reality such as lack of systematic approaches and the existence of technical barriers in massive condition data acquisition, transmission, storage and mining. Recently, the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing (CC) are being developed quickly and they offer new opportunities for evolutionary design for such tasks as data acquisition, storage and processing. In this paper, a framework for the closed-loop design evolution of engineering systems is proposed in order to achieve continuous design improvement for an engineering system through the use of a machine condition monitoring system assisted by IoT and CC. New design requirements or the detection of design weaknesses of an existing engineering system can be addressed through the proposed framework. A design knowledge base that is constructed by integrating design expertise from domain experts, on-line process information from condition monitoring and other design information from various sources is proposed to realize and supervise the design process so as to achieve increased efficiency, design speed, and effectiveness. The framework developed in this paper is illustrated by using a case study of design evolution of an industrial manufacturing system.",

However, before finding wide applications, EHR systems have to tackle privacy and efficiency challenges. For one thing, the confidentiality of EHRs is one of most important issues concerned by patients. For another, wearable devices in mobile cloud computing are often resource-constrained to some extent. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme which is proven secure in the standard model under the decisional parallel bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption. In the proposed scheme, an EHR owner can generate offline ciphertexts before knowing EHR data and access policies, which performs a majority of computation tasks. Furthermore, the online phase can rapidly assemble the final ciphertexts when EHR data and access policies become known. Our EHR access control scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes. Extensive performance comparisons and simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is very suitable for mobile cloud computing.",

abstract = "The concept of Internet of Things (IOT), which is already at our front doors, is that every object in the Internet infrastructure (II) is interconnected into a global dynamic expanding network. Sensors and smart objects are beside classical computing devices key parties of the IOT. We can already exploit the benefits of the IOT by using various weareables or smart phones which are full of diverse sensors and actuators and are connected to the II via GPRS or Wi-Fi. Since sensors are a key part of IOT, thus are wireless sensor networks (WSN). Researchers are already working on new techniques and efficient approaches on how to integrate WSN better into the IOT environment. One aspect of it is the security aspect of the integration. Recently, Turkanović et al.’s proposed a highly efficient and novel user authentication and key agreement scheme (UAKAS) for heterogeneous WSN (HWSN) which was adapted to the IOT notion. Their scheme presented a novel approach where a user from the IOT can authenticate with a specific sensor node from the HWSN without having to communicate with a gateway node. Moreover their scheme is highly efficient since it is based on a simple symmetric cryptosystem. Unfortunately we have found that Turkanović et al.’s scheme has some security shortcomings and is susceptible to some cryptographic attacks. This paper focuses on overcoming the security weaknesses of Turkanović et al.’s scheme, by proposing a new and improved UAKAS. The proposed scheme enables the same functionality but improves the security level and enables the HWSN to dynamically grow without influencing any party involved in the UAKAS. The results of security analysis by BAN-logic and AVISPA tools confirm the security properties of the proposed scheme.",

abstract = "The recent advances in internet of things (IoT) and industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) paradigm provide a promising opportunity for upgrading today’s elderly electricity industrial systems and even allow the fourth stage of the industrial revolution, referred to as smart grid industry (SGI) 4.0. In SGI 4.0 paradigm, the WSNs are considered as promising solutions due to their advantages, such as cable replacement, ease of deployment, flexibility, and cost reduction. However, harsh and complex smart grid (SG) environments pose great challenges to guarantee reliable communication for WSNs-based SG applications due to equipment noise, electromagnetic interference, multipath effects and fading in SG environments. This results in deteriorating the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements as well as the network lifetime of multi-hop communication-based WSNs for SG applications. Thus, for SGI 4.0 paradigm to come true, a WSN-based highly reliable communication infrastructure is crucial that will wirelessly connect and integrate power system components for more efficient, reliable, and intelligent operations of the next-generation electricity power grids. To address these challenges, in this paper a novel multi-mobile sinks-based QoS-aware data gathering protocol (called MQRP) for WSNs-based SG applications has been proposed to empower SGI 4.0. The extensive simulations study is carried through a network simulation tool called EstiNet9.0. The obtained experimental facts show that the proposed scheme has not only improved the QoS performance metrics, such as packet delivery ratio, memory utilization, control message overhead, residual energy, network lifetime, and throughput, but also reduced packet error rate and end-to-end delay compared to existing data collection schemes.",

Context refers to the particular settings that give additional information on the reasons behind the set of data that is obtained and its value to the end user. Context is often derived through inferences and reasoning techniques, the aim being disambiguation, reducing doubts, and improve confidence levels. In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare. The context broker that is presented in this paper addresses some critical healthcare issues: availability, cost and quality. This broker is for general and specialised healthcare needs in specific medical fields, and it is especially useful in emergency situations. It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria. The context broker collects queries from users (patients or their dependents), and refers them to the best and most affordable hospitals on the basis of their geographical location, financial status, quality of care and the availability of the requested medical services at the time their request is made.",

Online data sharing in healthcare industry not only increases the efficiency but also reduces the time constraints. In the healthcare wireless sensor network, patient’s report is available online for health professionals without any delay after patient’s checkup. Data privacy becomes an important issue in healthcare industry due to direct involvement of personal health related data of patients. Modified data may become a serious cause of casualty for patient. Digital signature scheme is a technique of public key cryptography that is widely accepted in digital world to retain privacy and integrity. Certificateless public key cryptography was proposed to remove the complication of certificate management in public key cryptography as well as the key escrow problem inherited in identity based cryptography. An aggregate signature scheme is a many to one map which maps different signatures on different messages to a single signature. This feature is very beneficial in an environment which is constrained by limited bandwidth and low computational time/effort, such as wireless sensor network, vehicular ad-hoc network and Internet of things. Our proposed certificateless aggregate signature enjoys the goodness of both the concepts, certificateless and aggregate. We construct a certificateless aggregate signature scheme and prove the security of constructed scheme by using widely-accepted Random Oracle Model under the computationally hard Diffie-Hellman assumption. Random Oracle Model based security analysis proves that our proposed scheme is provably secure against existential forgery on adaptive chosen message and identity attacks under the hardness of computational Diffie-Hellman problem and achieves the required goals such as confidentiality, non-repudiation and integrity. We use batch verification technique for speedy verification of signatures. Since energy consumption for aggregate signature verification in our scheme is lesser than that in many of the related schemes, the proposed CL-AS scheme is compatible with the resource scanty nature of wireless sensor networks. Thus the proposed CL-AS scheme is efficient and suitable for green healthcare wireless sensor networks (HWSNs).",

This will initiate new business opportunities in providing these novel applications and services, which integrate efficiently IoT services into business applications. Because IoT takes the reference scenarios further in terms of scale and features offered, it requires the development of suitable, scalable and available service delivery platforms that permit multiple services to coexist between IoT and 3rd party service providers. However, service delivery over IoT infrastructures is a difficult challenge that requires specific new architecture and mechanisms. This paper proposes a system architecture of hybrid service delivery that enables 3rd party service providers to create, deploy, execute, orchestrate, and manage efficiently the running instances of IoT services. In particular, this work focuses on the design and implementation of: agent-based hybrid service exposure, a hybrid service ontology engine crawler, a service enablers container, service-oriented agent lifecycle management, and an agent-mediated service lifecycle coordinator for messages dispatching and transformation between hybrid service exposure and the service enablers container. More specifically, with smart home scenarios, experimental results show that agent-based service delivery approaches could successfully coordinate between IoT and 3rd party service providers.",

In recent years, the literature associated with healthcare big data has grown rapidly, but few studies have used bibliometrics and a visualization approach to conduct deep mining and reveal a panorama of the healthcare big data field.
Methods
To explore the foundational knowledge and research hotspots of big data research in the field of healthcare informatics, this study conducted a series of bibliometric analyses on the related literature, including papers’ production trends in the field and the trend of each paper’s co-author number, the distribution of core institutions and countries, the core literature distribution, the related information of prolific authors and innovation paths in the field, a keyword co-occurrence analysis, and research hotspots and trends for the future.
Results
By conducting a literature content analysis and structure analysis, we found the following: (a) In the early stage, researchers from the United States, the People’s Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany made the most contributions to the literature associated with healthcare big data research and the innovation path in this field. (b) The innovation path in healthcare big data consists of three stages: the disease early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis phase, the life and health promotion phase, and the nursing phase. (c) Research hotspots are mainly concentrated in three dimensions: the disease dimension (e.g., epidemiology, breast cancer, obesity, and diabetes), the technical dimension (e.g., data mining and machine learning), and the health service dimension (e.g., customized service and elderly nursing).
Conclusion
This study will provide scholars in the healthcare informatics community with panoramic knowledge of healthcare big data research, as well as research hotspots and future research directions.",

abstract = "The importance and usefulness of requirements engineering (RE) techniques (elicitation, analysis, modeling, change management, etc.) have been proven oftentimes in domains such as telecommunications and cybersystems. However, in healthcare, such practices, beyond elicitation, are immature. The introduction of changes to existing healthcare processes or e-systems often fails because users’ needs and operational/organizational goals may not get satisfied. In addition, healthcare is moving toward a value-based paradigm that requires a comprehensive evaluation and re-engineering of current processes, which puts more pressure on healthcare professionals to apply advanced RE techniques, such as goal and process modeling, in order to obtain much desired results effectively. In this paper, we discuss the integration of new technology-depending processes, e.g., that come with off-the-shelf solutions, with existing healthcare processes. We propose the use of an Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) framework to investigate the impact of each potential integration on the organizational goals and user satisfaction. Performance indicators are used to reason about measurable quantities beyond goal satisfaction. The paper implements the AbPI approach with the User Requirement Notation standard and illustrates its feasibility with a real example related to wait time indication in an emergency room. Important research challenges are identified along the way.",

In this paper we will analyse not only the applicability of existing mechanisms such as public key cryptography and pre-shared keys for sensor nodes in the IoT context, but also the applicability of those link-layer oriented key management systems (KMS) whose original purpose is to provide shared keys for sensor nodes belonging to the same WSN.",

abstract = "The rapid growth in the population density in urban cities demands that services and an infrastructure be provided to meet the needs of city inhabitants. Thus, there has been an increase in the request for embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays, base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework, and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban planning or city future development, the offline historical data are analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of throughput and processing time.",

VLC technology has emerged as an alternative solution to radio-frequency (RF) wireless systems, due to its various merits, e.g., ubiquity, power efficiency, no RF radiation, and security. With VLC, critical bio-medical signals, including electrocardiography (ECG), can be transmitted in places where RF radiation is restricted. This potential advantage of VLC could save more lives in emergency situations. A time hopping (TH) scheme is employed to transfer multiple medical-data streams in real time with a simple system design. Multiple data streams are transmitted using identical color LEDs and go into an optical detector. The received multiple data streams are demodulated and rearranged using a TH-based demodulator. The medical data is then monitored and managed to provide the necessary medical care for each patient.",

abstract = "Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

abstract = "The number of people with a chronic disease is rapidly increasing, giving the healthcare industry more challenging problems. To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology–aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-making knowledge using Protégé Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient for patient risk factors extraction and diabetes prescriptions.",

Inferential Bayesian probability could present more complete data of a fall to healthcare providers.

For each HCF type, research gaps and possible future directions are identified.

In such complex circumstances, the perception of interoperability needs to evolve from the consideration of interoperating pairs of systems to the capability of an autonomous system to sense, interpret, understand and act upon arbitrary messages received from a potentially unknown sender. In this sense, interoperability becomes in fact a property of the system. In this paper, we elaborate on an evolved concept of interoperability in context of ubiquitous healthcare systems.

This paper focuses on such an environment and proposes a novel user authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous ad hoc wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme enables a remote user to securely negotiate a session key with a general sensor node, using a lightweight key agreement protocol. The proposed scheme ensures mutual authentication between the user, sensor node, and the gateway node (GWN), although the GWN is never contacted by the user. The proposed scheme has been adapted to the resource-constrained architecture of the WSN, thus it uses only simple hash and XOR computations. Our proposed scheme tackles these risks and the challenges posed by the IOT, by ensuring high security and performance features.",

Henceforth, in this paper, the Cloud Centric IoT (CCIoT) Technology is utilized to assess the health related attributes of a trainee during exercise sessions in a gymnasium. The proposed system have the capabilities to predict the probabilistic vulnerability to health parameters of a trainee during workouts. For this purpose, back-propagation based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique is used as a prediction model, layered into three stages, i.e. Monitoring, Learning, and Prediction. Also, the probabilistic vulnerability is represented in real-time using color-coded technique, depicting the health state of the trainee. The proposed system has been validated using an experiment in which five people were monitored for six days at different gymnasiums. Results are compared with different state-of-the-art techniques for determining the overall effectiveness of the proposed system.",

abstract = "Mobile healthcare networks (MHNs) are increasingly viewed as potential applications for further improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare, with the rapid development of wearable devices. Wearable devices can generate a huge amount of health data, causing big data to be one of the most prominent features. The privacy and security of big data-based MHNs are major concerns of users, and these are the overriding obstacles that stand in the way of the wider adoption of MHNs. For the sake of security, health data is encrypted and stored on an untrusted server. However, the flexibility of the data is thereby affected, such as a search over encrypted health data, or authorization control for a search and verification of the search result. To address these problems, we propose a verifiable keyword search scheme for big data-based MHNs with fine-grained authorization control. In the proposed scheme, when sending the search request to the healthcare provider for the first time, the user needs to check whether he or she has the right to search within encrypted health data. Only authorized users can generate valid trapdoors for searching. Our verification technique is constructed based on an invertible Bloom lookup table and a Merkle hash tree, which can verify the completeness and correctness of the search result even if an empty set is returned by a dishonest healthcare provider. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure against chosen keyword attacks. The proposed scheme is efficient with low computation load, which can be used to perform eyword searches and verify the search results quickly in a big data environment.",

abstract = "In this paper, a secure and efficient authentication and authorization architecture for IoT-based healthcare is developed. Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based DTLS handshake protocol as it is the main IP security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a TI SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The CC2538 module integrated into the TI board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.",

M2M refers to networks, which connect devices together and enable them to make a smart decision. The most viable option of implementing M2M communication is over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. A key challenge for M2M communication over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the performance of Random Access Channel (RACH) because its operation was not designed with the enormous number of M2M devices in mind. To deal with the situation reduces network access success rate, several major access control methods were adopted. However, the suggested methods generally increase the access success rate regardless of delay requirements. On the other hand, access delay is crucial for many M2M applications such as healthcare. This paper investigates the effects of LTE Random Access Methods on healthcare M2M applications when enormous number of devices are introduced. The study clearly shows that to meet the requirements for delay sensitive M2M applications, the random access (RA) resources should be very strictly and carefully allocated.",

Considering these restrictions, IoT resource allocation problem (IRAP) is one of the most critical problems because a good solution to this problem will be very useful for enhancing the performance of such a system. That is why an effective algorithm will be presented in this paper for solving the IoT resource allocation problem of the internet of things. The concepts of data clustering and metaheuristic are employed for the proposed algorithm to allocate the large-scale devices and gateways of IoT to reduce the total communication cost between them. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the other resource allocation algorithms compared in this paper in terms of the total data communication costs.",

Moreover, the pervasive nature of IoT data presents a number of privacy threats because of intermediate data processing steps, including data acquisition, data aggregation, fusion and integration. User profiling and record linkage are well studied topics in online social networks (OSNs); however, these have become more critical in IoT applications where different systems share and integrate data and information.

Adopting a design science research approach we developed the solution based around stakeholders’ collaborative participation in prototyping and then evaluated the design using focus groups. The cloud-based solution supports doctors in evaluating and diagnosing patients’ data and medical history through intermediary health care workers or community clinics. The design also knowledgeably allows informed decisions on a course of treatment with follow up for remote or underserved communities.

Trust management plays an important role in such SCIoT scenarios where smart objects have to establish social relationships. Also, these smart objects select other objects in their vicinity as friend or foe based on their trust upon those objects to establish an effective successful collaboration. In this paper, we contribute to present a survey of existing trust management schemes for SIoT, compare them by outlining their features and identify their drawbacks, etc. Furthermore, as far as our knowledge is concerned, we are the first to propose the definition of SCIoT, a hierarchical model of SCIoT for its important processes and a few application scenarios.

The performance evaluation results show that the IoT implementation yields much lower latencies than the WSN implementation, and the latency does not depend on the location of the trolley or the building size. Also, the IoT approach yields slightly better battery life expectancy than the WSN approach.

abstract = "This paper explains a novel approach for knowledge discovery from data generated by Point of Care (POC) devices. A very important element of this type of knowledge extraction is that the POC generated data would never be identifiable, thereby protecting the rights and the anonymity of the individual, whilst still allowing for vital population-level evidence to be obtained. This paper also reveals a real-world implementation of the novel approach in a big data analytics system. Using Internet of Things (IoT) enabled POC devices and the big data analytics system, the data can be collected, stored, and analyzed in batch and real-time modes to provide a detailed picture of a healthcare system as well to identify high-risk populations and their locations. In addition, the system offers benefits to national health authorities in forms of optimized resource allocation (from allocating consumables to finding the best location for new labs) thus supports efficient and timely decision-making processes.",

The demand-side management (DSM) of energy systems has drawn considerable industrial and academic attention in attempts to form new flexibilities to respond to variations in renewable energy inputs to the system. However, many DSM concepts are still in the experimental demonstration phase. One of the obstacles to DSM usage is that the current information infrastructure was mainly designed for centralized systems, and does not meet DSM requirements. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a novel information infrastructure named the Internet of Energy Things (IoET) in order to make DSM practicable by basing it on the latest wireless communication technology: the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The primary advantage of LPWAN over general packet radio service (GPRS) and area Internet of Things (IoT) is its wide-area coverage, which comes with minimum power consumption and maintenance costs. Against this background, this paper briefly reviews the representative LPWAN technologies of narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Range (LoRa) technology, and compares them with GPRS and area IoT technology. Next, a wireless-to-cloud architecture is proposed for the IoET, based on the main technical features of LPWAN. Finally, this paper looks forward to the potential of IoET in various DSM application scenarios.",

Second, a power level and packet size decision (PPD) algorithm is presented to decide the optimal packet size, by either minimizing the delay at a prescribed transmission power or minimizing energy consumption with a prescribed delay. Third, a global link decision (GLD) scheme is devised to improve overall reliability and decrease overall delay simultaneously through raising availability of battery energy within nodes. Theoretical analysis demonstrated the validity of the GLD scheme. Moreover, experimental results show that the GLD scheme improves the transmission reliability by 8.70% and decreases the delay by 7.74%, without reducing the network lifetime, which was not achieved in previous research studies.",

Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled ubiquitous internet access to biomedical datasets and techniques; in result, the progress in CADx is significant. Unlike the conventional CADx, deep learning techniques have the basic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature as they have the ability to learn mid and high level image representations. We proposed a Computer-Assisted Decision Support System in Pulmonary Cancer by using the novel deep learning based model and metastasis information obtained from MBAN (Medical Body Area Network). The proposed model, DFCNet, is based on the deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) which is used for classification of each detected pulmonary nodule into four lung cancer stages. The performance of proposed work is evaluated on different datasets with varying scan conditions. Comparison of proposed classifier is done with the existing CNN techniques. Overall accuracy of CNN and DFCNet was 77.6% and 84.58%, respectively. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the detection and classification of lung cancer nodules. These results demonstrate the potential for the proposed technique in helping the radiologists in improving nodule detection accuracy with efficiency.",

These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

The former is about filtering the significance in the appropriate format, while the latter provides emerging categories of the whole domain. This path of the data is a bottom-up flow. On the other hand, the path of the process is a top-down flow, starting at the strategic level of business and scientific institutions. Today, the path of the process treasures a sizeable amount of well-known methods, architectures and technologies: the so called Big Data. On the top, Big Data analytics aims variable association (e-commerce), data mining (predictive behaviour) or clustering (marketing segmentation). Digging the Big Data architecture there are a myriad of enabling technologies for data taking, storage and management. However the strategic aim is to enhance knowledge with the appropriate information, which does need of data, but not vice versa. In the way, the magnitude of upcoming data from the IoT will disrupt the data centres. To cope with the extreme scale is a matter of moving the computing services towards the data sources. This paper explores the possibilities of providing many of the IoT services which are currently hosted in monolithic cloud centres, moving these computing services into nano data centres (NaDa). Particularly, data-information processes, which usually are performing at sub-problem domains. NaDa distributes computing power over the already present machines of the IP provides, like gateways or wireless routers to overcome latency, storage cost and alleviate transmissions. Large scale questionnaires have been taken for 300 IT professionals to validate the points of view for IoT adoption. Considering IoT is by definition connected to the Internet, NaDa may be used to implement the logical low layer architecture of the services. Obviously, such distributed NaDa send results on a logical high layer in charge of the information-knowledge turn. This layer requires the whole picture of the domain to enable those processes of Big Data analytics on the top.",

This device will provide guidance and support for the prevention of exacerbations, the major cause of asthma attacks.

The firm desires to target initial niche markets for a subset of this product. This may be a better approach than bearing the high expense for the one time effort of only entering the medical market. Several initial niche markets appear attractive. These include: home care, asthma management, fitness/lifestyle, wellness, and hospital care. The question is, “Which one is more attractive?” By formulating this decision problem as a hierarchical decision model (HDM) with the different niche markets as the alternatives and selecting various levels of criteria we were able to address this question. An expert panel consisting of the firm׳s executive and operational management, subject matter experts, and external industry analysts was selected to obtain its collective judgments. The results representing the expert panel׳s judgment indicated that asthma management and home care markets were most attractive and the other three were given less relative importance. Intermediate results were also of interest, such as the relative importance of: market, financial, product, and corporate alignment objectives; regions within the market objectives; and decision elements that contributed to both financial and product objectives.",

abstract = "In the era of “big data”, recent developments in the area of information and communication technologies (ICT) are facilitating organizations to innovate and grow. These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.",

abstract = "Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), as a dramatic platform for pervasive computing and communication, has been widely applied in healthcare domains. Since the patient-related data in the form of text, image, voice, etc. is significant in the process of healthcare services, efficiently managing these media data from various WBAN is vital for various applications. Recently, Cloud-assisted WBAN has become popular that can supply massive computing, flexible storage and various software services to WBAN. Still, there are some challenging issues exist in this platform to deliver and share the huge media healthcare data to remote terminals timely with guaranteed QoS support. In the paper, we propose an efficient network model that combines WBAN and Cloud for valid data sharing. The proposed network architecture is designed as four layers: perception layer, network layer, cloud computing layer, and application layer. In the network, the integration of TCP/IP and Zigbee in the coordinator devices is utilized. Consequently, WBAN coordinators can compatibility inter-operate with various local networks such as WiFi and LTE network to support high mobility of users. Besides, we integrate Content Centric Networking (CCN) with our proposed architecture to improve the ability of the WBAN coordinator. Thus, it can support uninterrupted media healthcare content delivery. In addition, adaptive streaming technique was also utilized to reduce packet loss. Various simulations were conducted using OPNET simulator to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture in terms of transmitting a huge amount of media healthcare data in real-time under traditional IP-based network.",

abstract = "Health promotion in hospital environments can be improved using the most recent information and communication technologies. The Internet connectivity to small sensor nodes carried by patients allows remote access to their bio-signals. To promote these features the healthcare wireless sensor networks (HWSN) are used. In these networks mobility support is a key issue in order to keep patients under real-time monitoring even when they move around. To keep sensors connected to the network, they should change their access points of attachment when patients move to a new coverage area along an infirmary. This process, called handover, is responsible for continuous network connectivity to the sensors. This paper presents a detailed performance evaluation study considering three handover mechanisms for healthcare scenarios (Hand4MAC, RSSI-based, and Backbone-based). The study was performed by simulation using several scenarios with different number of sensors and different moving velocities of sensor nodes. The results show that Hand4MAC is the best solution to guarantee almost continuous connectivity to sensor nodes with less energy consumption.",

The wireless sensor network (WSN) has a wide range of uses. It can be used, for example, as a powerful tool for gathering several kinds of environmental information. This type of monitoring fits in the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), which aims to optimize the real world processes by monitoring their variables. In this study, a WSN developed in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard was used with the objective of measuring the local temperature. The access to the data was available through a WLAN network in the IEEE 802.11 standard (also known as Wi-Fi), an already existing network or a solution's dedicated network were used. Quality tests of signal and maximum range of communication of the WSN were made, as well as the network's battery lifetime usage estimates. Finally, the study also shows the monitoring of the temperature of some environments.",

We have conducted a systematic mapping using a number of automated searches from the most relevant academic databases to address these questions. This mapping has identified a number of state of the art approaches which provides a good reference for researchers.

In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices. ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.",

In this paper, we propose a system that monitors for any signs of nightmares, attempts to suppress them, or wakes the patient slowly if unsuccessful, thus improving the quality of life of those who suffer from nightmares related to PTSD. Consisting of a combination of temperature control, aromatherapy, and auditory therapy capabilities, the proposed innovation will be integrated in the form of a wearable device. The Internet of Things resource in the realm of home automation technology enables the affordable use of smart sensors as the foundation for the system. Wearable technology ties the individual into the countermeasure network and monitors for nightmare conditions. The system will have the capability of optimization through machine learning and remote management. Due to widespread diagnosis of PTSD in those exposed to trauma, the system has the potential to positively impact millions of people and reduce rates of depression and suicide.",

abstract = "A wide range of specific health issues affects the elderly, but one particularly significant issue in geriatric healthcare is non-adherence to medication regimens, particularly among elderly patients living alone. To address this problem, a range of electronic pillbox devices has been developed. Although these may offer a partial solution to this problem by ameliorating the issue of failing memory, it is important to have a full picture of medication adherence that includes other aspects besides forgetfulness. This article proposes an empathetic u-pillbox system that aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing systems in ensuring adherence to a medication regime and makes an effort to design a holistic elderly healthcare framework by supporting additional functionalities like providing personalized services to the elderly based on an awareness of their individual situations by placing emphases on understanding of the elderly and provision of humanistic care. This system consists of three main processes: data acquisition of the elderly situation and medicine taking state; data analysis and elderly model enhancement; and provision of empathetic services to the elderly, in which cyber-I, human model, data cycle for the spiral quality of model enhancement, knowledge fusion towards wisdom for providing smart services are our critical concepts and techniques. This article will describe the system by going through three scenarios concerning the elderly using and interacting with the proposed u-pillbox system. Although this system is designated for geriatric healthcare, it has a potential extension to general health monitoring and care at home. Moreover, there are many potential applications in clinic or hospital medication care systems. We believe the proposed framework to be a promising approach to one of the great social challenges facing societies in the 21st century.",

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",

Germany announced the Industry 4.0 strategy in 2013. The US government launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) in 2011 and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in 2014. Most recently, the Manufacturing USA initiative was officially rolled out to further “leverage existing resources... to nurture manufacturing innovation and accelerate commercialization” by fostering close collaboration between industry, academia, and government partners. In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed.

Internet technologies and advancements in social interaction tools have led to an increase in the use of the crowd as a provider of business solutions. Yet, we have seen a mere fraction of the possibilities of crowdsourcing technologies. This is because most of the development, discussion, and research around crowdsourcing has focused on active-input crowdsourcing. However, the real transformative pressure will come from passive sources of data generated primarily by developing and growing sensor technologies. This next generation of crowdsourcing will be a game changer for entrepreneurial opportunities. As crowdsourcing systems proliferate, more input will be acquired from sensors, artificial intelligence, bots, and other devices. As a result of this explosion, the variety of product and service opportunities will swell as entrepreneurs become more aware of technologies merging—such as the combination of crowdsourcing, sensors, and big data into a new type of entrepreneurship: sensor-based entrepreneurship. The purpose of this research is to contribute by (1) clarifying the next generation of crowdsourcing and (2) developing and presenting a framework to help sensor-based entrepreneurs plan, develop, and map their new products and services.",

The risk evaluation of CHD is a widely used method for preventing the disease in ubiquitous healthcare and helping diagnosing in clinical reception. However, the traditional risk evaluation methods are neither accurate nor dynamic because they stick to the statistical data and neglect the important temporal effects of the vital signs. This paper proposes a new linear time-invariant model-based CHD evaluation method, which allows evaluating the CHD development dynamically over the whole lifetime. Currently identified model can give the dynamic evaluation of 43–77 years with about 5% errors in comparison with the clinical gold standard, the SYNTAX score. In addition, the model also gives a quantitative weight to each risk factor, which is also helpful for risk control in both clinics and ubiquitous healthcare. Current application of this approach in clinics has proved its efficiency in the pre-diagnosing and post-clinical ubiquitous health management.",

It can be defined as the union and cooperation of paradigms such as Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS) and Internet of Content (IoC). In these paradigms, the role of Service oriented Computing (SoC) deserves special attention. FI can be defined as an association of web services encompassing innovative services such as converged services, intelligent services and related smart services for overcoming the structural limitations of the current internet. Among many key concerns in the services environment, service discovery and optimal service selection are considered to be vital. Service discovery enables the client to get access to the right service at the right time to complete the requested tasks while service selection determines the feasible service composition that fulfils a set of conditions while maintaining a rich Quality of User Experience (QoUE) and good Quality of Service (QoS). This paper proposes the FI middleware named MIFIM (MIddleware for Future Internet Models) incorporated with Aspect Oriented Module (AOM) for addressing the challenges in particular related to the unknown topology and missing data estimation present in IoT service discovery and optimal service selection routine named Composite Service Selection Module (CSSM) for deriving the best service composition in IoS paradigm. The AOM is evaluated in accordance with MUSIC pervasive computing middleware while CSSM is compared with the other optimality approaches. Experimental results were found encouraging and the proposed components were performing reasonably well when compared to the similar solutions.",

We extend this novel concept in this paper and refer it as “Healthcare services on-the-fly”. The concept of game theory has been used among the vehicles to access the healthcare services while traveling. The vehicles act as players in the game and tend to form and split coalitions to access these services. Learning automata (LA) act as the players for interaction with the environment and take appropriate actions based on reward and penalty. Apart from this, Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling algorithm for efficient utilization of resources at cloud level has also been formulated. A stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model is used to represent the coalition formation and splitting with respect to availability of resources at cloud level. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics.

Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system – the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) – and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the ‘missing link’ in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things.",

abstract = "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has several benefits over traditional endoscopy such as its portability and ease of usage, particularly for remote internet of things (IoT)-assisted healthcare services. During the WCE procedure, a significant amount of redundant video data is generated, the transmission of which to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists securely for analysis is challenging as well as wastage of several resources including energy, memory, computation, and bandwidth. In addition to this, it is inherently difficult and time consuming for gastroenterologists to analyze this huge volume of gastrointestinal video data for desired contents. To surmount these issues, we propose a secure video summarization framework for outdoor patients going through WCE procedure. In the proposed system, keyframes are extracted using a light-weighted video summarization scheme, making it more suitable for WCE. Next, a cryptosystem is presented for security of extracted keyframes based on 2D Zaslavsky chaotic map. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed cryptosystem in terms of robustness and high-level security compared to other recent image encryption schemes during dissemination of important keyframes to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists for personalized WCE.",

A possible solution to reduce healthcare costs in a world that is aging is the adoption of telehealth technologies. Several solutions appeared, in the past suggesting the use of smart devices (mobile phones or tablets) for supporting telehealth. Unfortunately, elderly people may have difficulties in the use of such devices even if user interfaces are becoming friendly and intuitive. This work introduces the concept of “Smartstone”, that is the use of a (low-cost) smartphone as a simple, effective, and portable gateway/edge server for mobile healthcare towards cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The Smartstone is designed in order to minimize the user interaction, thanks to its autonomous behavior. The adoption of smart devices as a building block ensures state-of-the-art connectivity and relatively high computational power, complemented by an ensemble of additional onboard sensors. In particular, results about the management of a new photoplethysmographic /bio-impedance monitor and a smart pill dispenser are presented in this work.",

The IoT has already enabled these bodies to develop a new network of intercommunicating objects of consumers’ everyday life. Companies staffing many (potentially thousands) of employees may require hundreds of health and safety systems in continuous use. Building Service Managers, however, do not know which devices needs maintenance or replenishment and require significant amount of time to continuously check that their health and safety systems are maintained according to legislation requirements. The consequences of companies not meeting their health and safety obligations are serious and expensive if any of their employees are seriously injured as a consequence of the health and safety products not being in their original, immaculate order for use. Furthermore, insurance companies will refuse to pay compensation for injury to employees if it has been shown that the health and safety products are not in their original, immaculate order for use. Therefore, design and use an IoT based monitoring system to record the state of health and safety products within companies is an urgent response to market.

Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.",

In order to achieve semantic interoperability in smart homes we have developed Smart Home Ontology, which gives semantics for the data that are exchanged by the systems and devices in a smart home. From technology point of view, we have studied the combination of cloud computing and Internet of Things as they enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual “things”, thus stimulating innovations in both fields.

The system is composed of fundus image pre-processing, image feature extraction, and automatic cataract classification and grading. The wavelet transform and the sketch based methods are investigated to extract from fundus image the features suitable for cataract classification and grading. After feature extraction, a multiclass discriminant analysis algorithm is used for cataract classification, including two-class (cataract or non-cataract) classification and cataract grading in mild, moderate, and severe. A real-world dataset, including fundus image samples with mild, moderate, and severe cataract, is used for training and testing. The preliminary results show that, for the wavelet transform based method, the correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 90.9% and 77.1%, respectively. The correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 86.1% and 74.0% for the sketch based method, which is comparable to the wavelet transform based method. The pilot study demonstrates that our research on fundus image analysis for cataract classification and grading is very helpful for improving the efficiency of fundus image review and ophthalmic healthcare quality. We believe that this work can serve as an important reference for the development of similar health information system to solve other medical diagnosis problems.",

Recent studies confirm a steep and constant increase of the diffusion of smart objects, which are capable to interact with the real world and to communicate and gather information autonomously through Internet connections. In the rush of devising and releasing to the market the next killer application for the IoT domain, critical issues regarding the cybersecurity risks are currently overlooked. Because security, like most software qualities, is not an orthogonal requirement, i.e. one that can be satisfied by adding some features at any development stage, this is going to have a very costly impact, potentially leading to failure, on the technologies currently developed for the IoT domain. In order to cope adequately with such issues, IoT applications need to be designed to be secure since their inception and suitable security assessment tools should be made available. This paper describes an approach based on the exploitation of virtual environments and agent-based simulation for the evaluation of cybersecurity solutions for the next generation of IoT applications in realistic scenarios. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by considering a concrete case study involving the cooperation of real and virtual smart devices inside a virtualized scenario where security issues are first evaluated and then handled.",

Moreover, a sensor-packed manufacturing system in which each process or piece of equipment makes available event and status information, coupled with market research for true advanced Big Data analytics, seem to be the right ingredients for event response selection and operation virtualization.

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a global network in which any things (including humans and the real world things) having unique identifier can communicate each other. The RFID system has very important role in the IoT system for solving the identification issues of things cost-effectively. However, RFID systems have serious security and privacy issues. In the literature, there are many proposals that aim to solve to security and privacy issues of RFID systems. The common drawback of these solution is scalability because they generally require a linear search on the back-end database in order to identify a tag. Some proposals use tree structures to store the keys. They reduce the search complexity from O(n) to O(log n). However, these protocols are susceptible to compromising attack in which an adversary compromising one tag can reveal the secrets of other tags. That means tree-based protocols can provide only a weak level of privacy. In this paper, we propose a scalable authentication protocol for RFID systems. Our solution utilizes Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in order to achieve higher level of privacy with constant identification time. It provides destructive privacy according to the Vaudenay’s privacy and security model. It defends against compromising attack by using PUFs as a secure storage to keep secrets of the tag. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first protocol providing such a privacy level with constant identification time.",

Due to the dynamic nature of the target network environment, the 6TiSCH WG is now calling for an efficient distributed scheduling through a Scheduling Function in which the neighbor nodes negotiate with one another to add/delete cells to satisfy the bandwidth requirement. A Scheduling Function consists of the following two main points: when a node should add/delete one or more cells to its neighbor, and the cells that should be selected. Although several Scheduling Function studies have been conducted, the primary focus of the current works is the first point, while the optimal selection method regarding the cells remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, a reliable distributed cell-selection mechanism for the Scheduling Function in the 6TiSCH networks is proposed. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed mechanism helps in the reductions of the negotiation-error ratio, the number of colliding cells and the signaling overhead compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena.",

In this paper, we show how design models can be derived from narratives of key situations, guided by information systems ontologies, and domain specific input theories. This conceptual level offers an innovative approach for designing Ubiquitous Information Systems (UIS) in general and Healthcare Ubiquitous Information Systems (H-UIS) in particular. The proposed design approach is applied for developing H-UIS for reducing Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) by improving the communications between patients and healthcare professionals. Using the domain specific input theory of Health Promotion Model (HPM), the modeling guidelines for design models are generated and utilized in the development of a H-UIS to avoid ADEs. The H-UIS improves several processes involving information technologies for healthcare professionals.

In this paper, the problem is addressed through a joint interest, physical and energy-aware clustering and resource management framework, capitalizing on the wireless powered communication (WPC) technique. Within the proposed framework the numerous M2M devices initially form different clusters based on the low complexity Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), properly adapted to account for interest, physical and energy related factors. Following that, a cluster-head is selected among the members of each cluster. The proposed approach enables the devices of a cluster with the support of the cluster-head to harvest and store energy in a stable manner through Radio Frequency (RF) signals adopting the WPC paradigm, thus prolonging the operation of the overall M2M network. Each M2M device is associated with a generic utility function, which appropriately represents its degree of satisfaction in relation to the consumed transmission power. Based on the distributed nature of the M2M network, a maximization problem of each device's utility function is formulated as a non-cooperative game and its unique Nash equilibrium point is determined, in terms of devices’ optimal transmission powers. Considering the devices’ equilibrium transmission powers, the optimal charging transmission powers of the cluster-heads are derived. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via modeling and simulation and under various topologies and scenarios, and its operational efficiency and effectiveness is demonstrated.",

Health monitoring systems based on Internet-of-things (IoT) have been recently introduced to improve the quality of health care services. However, the number of advanced IoT-based continuous glucose monitoring systems is small and the existing systems have several limitations. In this paper we study feasibility of invasive and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system utilizing IoT based approach. We designed an IoT-based system architecture from a sensor device to a back-end system for presenting real-time glucose, body temperature and contextual data (i.e. environmental temperature) in graphical and human-readable forms to end-users such as patients and doctors. In addition, nRF communication protocol is customized for suiting to the glucose monitoring system and achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate energy consumption of the sensor device and design energy harvesting units for the device. Finally, the work provides many advanced services at a gateway level such as a push notification service for notifying patient and doctors in case of abnormal situations (i.e. too low or too high glucose level). The results show that our system is able to achieve continuous glucose monitoring remotely in real-time. In addition, the results reveal that a high level of energy efficiency can be achieved by applying the customized nRF component, the power management unit and the energy harvesting unit altogether in the sensor device.",

abstract = "The United States needs to reimagine the basic principles of its telecommunications and information policy to fit an emerging society in which networking and intelligence are embedded into an increasing number of everyday things which constantly monitor and measure our lives. This emerging environment is an always-on, ubiquitous, integrated system comprised of the Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence/Intelligent Systems and the Intercloud, which act together as a single system, referred to here as the “Embedded Infosphere” (EI). This development is driving the latest stage – the third – in the evolution of U.S. communications policy. Each of the components of the EI presents unique challenges, but the greater concern is all of them acting in concert. These developments bring into focus many topics that have been outside the traditional communications policy envelope, and exceed the portfolios of existing agencies and institutions. This article envisions a new “EI policy space,” grounded in established societal values, and built on the experience of the previous stages. There are appropriate policy responses to each of the challenges, but these responses need to be seen in a holistic perspective, as they are all interconnected. Many of the issues such as privacy, security, consumer protection, and data stewardship are common across several elements. The larger goal is to establish a framework for an integrated policy structure which can address unpredictable emergent conditions, while allowing markets to flourish without unduly burdensome regulations, restrictions or uncertainties. This articles suggests a high-level analytical framework of criteria against which proposed EI policies can be measured. While there may be no “perfect” policies, some may be better (or worse) than others. It also offers a political process designed to incorporate the concept of the EI into national policy thinking. This approach should be implemented through a series of steps and should provide flexibility for development. The initial step is a process by which the EI can be acknowledged, its development analyzed, and the national interests institutionalized. The U.S. Senate has already initiated this process with the pending “DIGIT” Act, designed to bring together the core federal stakeholders and open a policy discourse which will be expanded over time to other key stakeholders. This should lead to the development of a national EI strategy. Since the EI is progressively global, the article suggests how both the normative and regulatory dimensions can be approached in the global context. It raises the possibility of a restructured ICANN “Empowered Community” as a possible venue for developing policies and recommendations in this area. It notes that since global unanimity is unlikely, non-governmental regimes will likely develop to address the unresolved policy interstices.",

In 2012, Big Data passed the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle, attesting the maturity level of this technology and its applications. The aim of this paper is to examine how do researchers grasp the big data concept? We will answer the following questions: How many research papers are produced? What is the annual trend of publications? What are the hot topics in big data research? What are the most investigated big data topics? Why the research is performed? What are the most frequently obtained research artefacts? What does big data research produces? Who are the active authors? Which journals include papers on Big Data? What are the active disciplines? For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on eight dimensions, including the SMACIT (Social Mobile Analytics Cloud Internet of Things) perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a systematic mapping study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications. The results have shown that significant contributions have been made by the research community, attested by a continuous increase in the number of scientific publications that address Big Data. We found that researchers are increasingly involved in research combining Big Data and Analytics, Cloud, Internet of things, mobility or social media. As for quality objectives, besides an interest in performance, other topics as scalability is emerging. Moreover, security and quality aspects become important. Researchers on Big Data provide more algorithms, frameworks, and architectures than other artifacts. Finally, application domains such as earth, energy, medicine, ecology, marketing, and health attract more attention from researchers on big data. A complementary content analysis on a subset of papers sheds some light on the evolving field of big data research.",

abstract = "Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration.",

abstract = "The increasing demand for highly customized products in connection with shortened product life cycles requires the manufacturing industry to be eminently flexible, whereas low production costs are crucial to persist in the competition of the global markets. To meet this requirements, cyber-physical systems (CPS) are applied into the production process, aiming for interconnected and self-managing smart factories, which can incorporate external and internal conditions for the autonomous adaptation to gain optimized results. This is achieved through a bi-directional information flow between all important components such as machines, products, control programs and off-site assets. Therefore it is essential to standardize communication interfaces and enhance interoperability between CPS of all variations. This paper presents an approach to combine the specification of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the guidelines of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 (I4.0), thus obtaining a uniform structure for industrial CPS. Based on the recommended asset administration shell for I4.0-components, the required functionality is identified and allocated to different segments. The five main segments include the functionality for security, representation, communication to external CPS, communication to internal assets and a section for additional applications to enhance the capabilities. By using a standardized protocol for the configuration and representation based on the object memory model of the W3C, a significant interoperability between I4.0-components and conventional Internet-of-Things can be realized. The proposed structure is applied in a use case to simulate the adaptation and remote maintenance of a production robot.",

abstract = "The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the interconnection and intercommunication among massive ubiquitous things, which caused an unprecedented generation of huge and heterogeneous amount of data, known as data explosions. On the other hand, although that cloud computing has served as an efficient way to process and store these data, however, challenges, such as the increasing demands of real time or latency-sensitive applications and the limitation of network bandwidth, still cannot be solved by using only cloud computing. Therefore, a new computing paradigm, known as fog computing, has been proposed as a complement to the cloud solution. Fog computing extends the cloud services to the edge of network, and makes computation, communication and storage closer to edge devices and end-users, which aims to enhance low-latency, mobility, network bandwidth, security and privacy. In this paper, we will overview and summarize fog computing model architecture, key technologies, applications, challenges and open issues. Firstly, we will present the hierarchical architecture of fog computing and its characteristics, and compare it with cloud computing and edge computing to emphasize the similarities and differences. Then, the key technologies like computing, communication and storage technologies, naming, resource management, security and privacy protection are introduced to present how to support its deployment and application in a detailed manner. Several application cases like health care, augmented reality, brain machine interface and gaming, smart environments and vehicular fog computing are also presented to further explain fog computing application scenarios. Finally, based on the observation, we propose some challenges and open issues which are worth further in-depth study and research in fog computing development.",

abstract = "The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g. high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next few years.",

Data produced by such sensors can be used for several purposes and by different actors, such as doctors, patients, relatives, and health care centers, in order to provide remote assistance to users. However, major challenges arise mainly in terms of the interoperability among several heterogeneous devices from a variety of manufacturers. In this context, we introduce EcoHealth (Ecosystem of Health Care Devices), a Web middleware platform for connecting doctors and patients using attached body sensors, thus aiming to provide improved health monitoring and diagnosis for patients. This platform is able to integrate information obtained from heterogeneous sensors in order to provide mechanisms to monitor, process, visualize, store, and send notifications regarding patients’ conditions and vital signs at real-time by using Internet standards.

With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.",

The TimeSlotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4 exploits a slow channel hopping approach to combat efficiently external interference (e.g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). We envision in the future very dense deployments and we investigate here the mutual influence among different colocated TSCH networks. We first study analytically with a simple model the performance of several TSCH networks, able or not to be synchronized with each other. We emphasize the multiplication of collisions, exacerbated by clock drifts when no cooperation is achieved. We also highlight experimentally that a mutual synchronization improves very significantly the reliability. We propose here a mechanism to re-synchronize distributively the border routers of different TSCH networks. Our thorough experimental evaluation illustrates the relevance of our approach, able to guarantee high-reliability, even in very dense topologies.",

An innovation model can incorporate those three components to provide greater value to stakeholders, drive organizational growth, gain a competitive advantage and achieve greater end-user satisfaction. We investigated how an enterprise systems model for open innovation could be created based on existing innovation socio-technical frameworks and how that model may benefit the UK National Health Service (NHS). We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the NHS is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments. The model strategy comprises rewarding people with shopping vouchers (Tesco club card points or nectar points) each time they confirm or cancel a medical appointment online or by SMS text message. With this model, the NHS would improve the management of their resources, may improve the quality of service and may have higher user satisfaction. Nevertheless, future challenges may include the adaptation of current NHS business processes and the management of the collaboration with private organizations.",

They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately.

Within this realm, innovations such as the Industrial Internet of Things, Cloud-based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM), and Social Product Development (SPD) have emerged with a focus on capitalizing on the benefits and economies of scale provided by Internet Protocol (IP) communication technologies.

In near future, the possibility of a truly global IoT is expected to be covered by connecting billions of devices through emerging wireless systems such as the fifth generation of cellular networks (5G). Employing enhanced multiple access technologies and providing effective resource allocation schemes to maximize the number of supported devices is a highly important factor to make future networks practical. Most of the current researches consider Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) techniques and try to improve Quality of Service (QoS) metrics like the data rate. In this work, we investigate the problem of allocating resources in an uplink MCCDMA wireless IoT network, including channel assignment and power control, to satisfy the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) requirement of all devices in a scalable manner. The problem is primarily formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem with the goal of maximizing the number of supported devices while the sum of transmit powers is minimized. We prove that the problem is NP-Hard in general, and use the Lagrangian relaxation and decomposition methods to provide a subgradient-based approach and find at least a near-optimal solution; yet in a homogeneous case where a same feasible SIR requirement and a same path gain are assumed for all devices, a closed-form solution is obtained. Towards an efficient solution for the general case, a centralized heuristic algorithm and an evolutionary distributed algorithm are developed. The distributed scheme consists of a Vickrey auction based channel assignment phase and a non-cooperative target SIR tracking power control phase to allocate resources in an iterative and decentralized manner. In the distributed scheme, the base station is not needed to know path gains. Numerical results show that the difference between the optimal solution and our proposed algorithms are negligible, so they can be efficiently employed in real-world scenarios.",

This paper presents a congestion and interference aware energy efficient routing technique for WSN namely, Survivable Path Routing. This protocol is supposed to work in the networks with high traffic because multiple sources try to send their packets to a destination at the same time, which is a typical scenario in IoT applications for remote healthcare monitoring. For selecting the next hop node, the algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of three factors: signal to interference and noise ratio of the link, the survivability factor the path from the next hop node to the destination, and the congestion level at the next hop node. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol works better concerning the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and the remaining energy level of the nodes. The rate of packet drops is also observed to be lesser in the congested topology scenarios.",

Internet of Things (IoT) has become an emerging trend in the information and engineering industries, which is inevitable to impact our lives in various ways. The advancement of IoT as an intelligent system is facing a number of challenges such as security and privacy. This paper aims to establish a starting point towards addressing this challenge by suggesting the implementation of data provenance in IoT. However, the complexity of IoT brings a number of challenges for utilizing provenance data. This paper discusses seven main challenges that influence data provenance implementation in IoT systems. The paper is expected to contribute to the literature that attempts to addresses the complex and multidimensional challenge of security and privacy in IoT.",

In order to encourage IoT market participation, reliable evidence guaranteeing market success needs to be presented to investors and enterprises. Particularly, the most promising domain in IoT needs to be discovered as a killer application to primarily invest in and develop, so that it can pioneer the IoT market. This study proposes an AHP model for assessing the viability of IoT applications, which consists of 11 technology, market, and regulation factors. The model was applied to assess and compare the prospect of three IoT applications — i.e. IoT healthcare, IoT logistics, and IoT energy management, inviting the perception of 31 ICT experts. The results showed that IoT logistics is the most promising IoT application, due to its strong market potential. IoT healthcare is perceived to have strength in wide consumer market demand, but reliability issues and regulation issues were posed. Meanwhile, IoT energy management showed strengths only in governmental support. The results also imply that it would be wiser for the government to focus on eliminating regulatory bottlenecks.",

Tags such as this will be critical to the practical realisation of the Internet of Things. The tag is able to autonomously measure and store electrode potential in its internal memory, and then transfer logged data wirelessly by RFID to a nearby reader or by near field communication (NFC) to a smart phone. The unique features of the sensor tag include its ultra low-power consumption, potentiometric sensing ability, autonomous data logging, and RFID/NFC compatible air interface. These features make the tag suitable for use where pH or ion-selective electrodes are deployed as stand-alone chemical sensors or as part of larger chemical sensor networks that will underpin the IoT. pH determination in solution is used as an experimental example for illustrating measurement capability of the tag, and its analytical performance is compared to a standard laboratory pH meter.",

Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery.",

The new BP monitoring system utilizes our recently developed biological and environmental signal monitoring Information Communication Technology/Internet of Things system, which can simultaneously monitor the environment (temperature, illumination, etc.) of different rooms in a house (entryway, bedroom, living room, bathing room, and toilet), and a wrist-type high-sensitivity actigraph for identifying the location of patients. By collecting both data on BP and environmental parameters, the system can assess the brachial and central hemodynamic BP reactivity profiles of patients, such as actisensitivity (BP change with PA), thermosensitivity (with temperature), and atmospheric sensitivity (with atmospheric pressure). We used this new system to monitor ambulatory BP variability in outpatients with one or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors both in summer and winter. Actisensitivity (the slope of the regression line of ambulatory BP against the log-physical activity) was higher in winter than summer. By multi-level analysis using the parameters monitored by this system, we estimated the ambulatory BPs under different conditions. The individual time-series big data collected by this system will contribute to anticipation medicine for CVD.",

By leveraging the capabilities of smart networked devices and integrating them into existing industrial, leisure and communication applications, the IoT is expected to positively impact both economy and society, reducing the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Therefore, several efforts have been dedicated to the development of networking solutions addressing the diversity of challenges associated with such a vision. In this context, the integration of Information Centric Networking (ICN) concepts into the core of IoT is a research area gaining momentum and involving both research and industry actors. The massive amount of heterogeneous devices, as well as the data they produce, is a significant challenge for a wide-scale adoption of the IoT. In this paper we propose a service discovery mechanism, based on Named Data Networking (NDN), that leverages the use of a semantic matching mechanism for achieving a flexible discovery process. The development of appropriate service discovery mechanisms enriched with semantic capabilities for understanding and processing context information is a key feature for turning raw data into useful knowledge and ensuring the interoperability among different devices and applications. We assessed the performance of our solution through the implementation and deployment of a proof-of-concept prototype. Obtained results illustrate the potential of integrating semantic and ICN mechanisms to enable a flexible service discovery in IoT scenarios.",

Whilst risk and threat assessments generally assume a stable and well-defined environment, this cannot be done in MIoT environments where devices may be added, removed, or changed in their configuration including connectivity to server back ends. Conducting a complete threat assessment for each such configuration changes is infeasible.

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation.",

IoT needs to support a multitude of heterogeneous objects extended with sensors, actuators, RFID’s, etc. These “Smart Objects” need unique identification, autonomous data transfer and communication with other objects. Consequently, these unique requisites of IoT need a promising future Internet architecture as it mostly revolves around data. Furthermore, the existing host-centric IP standards though advantageous, faces challenges like additional protocols for mobility, end-to-end security while deploying it with massive IoT applications. Named Data Networking (NDN) project is a new evolving data-centric internet architecture with innovative capabilities like caching, named data, security which mainly suits the specifications of IoT thereby proposed to solve the shortcomings of IP. NDN traditionally supports a PULL based traffic and its stateful forwarding engine despite its skillful nature need some modification while designing for an IoT system. In this paper, our foremost work is to classify and prioritize IoT traffic and enable delay-intolerant applications with low latency, to retrieve Data efficiently. Next, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based Interest scheduling for IoT traffic with varying priorities and measure the performance with different traffic probabilities. Our simulation results show that prioritizing and treating requests based on their traffic type can reduce network load by 30% thereby improving QoS in an IoT-NDN environment. The MDP-based IoT model schedules’ the Interest to the best interface efficiently reducing the RTT values on an average of 20%–30% than conventional forwarding strategies. The incurred delay is ∼30% better than existing work and forwarding strategies.",

However, the path to creating cloud networks of interconnected devices requires a means for devices that are not IP-based to connect without having to bear the cost of a full Ethernet or WiFi interface with the accompanying protocol stack. This can be achieved through the use of IoT gateways that bridge these devices to the Internet in the context of real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce an experimental study of a reliable and self-configurable IoT gateway that is developed in a laboratory testbed by using the IoTivity framework.",

With IoT several applications and services have been emerging in the areas such as, surveillance, healthcare, security, etc. The services offered can be accessed through smart device applications by the user from anywhere, anytime and anyplace. This makes security and privacy critical to IoT. Moreover, security is paramount in IoT, to enable secure access to the services; multi-factor based authentication can provide high security. In this paper, a lightweight biometric based remote user authentication and key agreement scheme for secure access to IoT services has been proposed. The protocol makes use of lightweight hash operations and XOR operation. The security analysis proves that it is robust against multiple security attacks. The formal verification is performed using AVISPA tool, which confirms its security in the presence of a possible intruder.",

By combining two experimental methods, i.e., a comparison between air and vacuum BS tests and interface trap extraction, BS instability is explained regardless of either the BS polarity or ambient condition, using a single platform constituted by four key factors: OH− adsorption/desorption followed by a change in carrier concentration, electron concentration in CNT channel corroborated with H2O/O2 molecules in ambient, charge trapping/detrapping, and interface trap generation. Under negative BS (NBS), the negative threshold voltage shift (ΔVT) is dominated by OH− desorption, which is followed by hole trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. Under positive BS (PBS), the positive ΔVT is dominated by OH− adsorption, which is followed by electron trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. This instability is compensated by interface trap extraction; PBS instability is slightly more complicated than NBS instability. Furthermore, our model is verified using device simulation, which gives insights on how much each mechanism contributes to BS instability. Our result is potentially useful for the design of highly stable CNT-based flexible circuits in the Internet of Things wearable healthcare era.",

However, recent advances in electronic healthcare systems allow transmission of sensitive information through the Internet, which is prone to various vulnerabilities, attacks and may leads to unauthorized disclosure. Such situations may not only create adverse effects for individuals but may also cause severe consequences such as hefty regulatory fines, bad publicity, legal fees, and forensics. To avoid such predicaments, a privacy protected healthcare system is proposed in this study that protects the identity of an individual as well as detects vocal fold disorders. The privacy of the developed healthcare system is based on the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm, which embeds a watermark in a secret key instead of the signals to avoid the distortion in an audio sample. The identity is protected by the generation of its secret shares through visual cryptography. The generated shares are embedded by finding the patterns into the audio with the application of one-dimensional local binary pattern. The proposed zero-watermarking algorithm is evaluated by using audio samples taken from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary voice disorder database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves imperceptibility and is reliable in its extraction of identity. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not affect the results of disorder detection and it is robust against noise attacks of various signal-to-noise ratios.",

However, it is difficult to detect early symptoms of dementia in elderly people living alone. In this study, we proposed a system which detects the symptoms of the elderly people living alone by using the M2M (Machine-to-Machine) /IoT (Internet of Things) platform. We installed sensors inside the house of elderly people living alone. These sensors can detect behavior by initial symptoms of the dementia. Also, these sensors’ data will be used as behavioral data of dementia patients. In addition, we conducted a questionnaire about their habits and personalities.

This installation is non-intrusive and quite simple because the sensor node to which sensors are connected is battery powered, and no additional work to ensure power supply needs to be performed.

To solve these problems, this study develops an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system to monitor the environmental factors of an orchid greenhouse and the growth status of Phalaenopsis at the same time. The whole system consists of an IoT-based environmental monitoring system and an IoT-based wireless imaging platform. An image processing algorithm based on the Canny edge detection method, the seeded region growing (SRG) method, and the mathematical morphology is also developed to estimate the leaf area of Phalaenopsis. The long-term experiments with respect to four different environmental conditions for cultivating Phalaenopsis are conducted. The statistical analysis methods, including the one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and Games-Howell test, are performed to examine the relation between the growth of Phalaenopsis leaves and the environmental factors in the greenhouse. The optimal cultivation conditions for Phalaenopsis can be easily identified. The experimental results indicate that the daily average growth rate of the leaf area of Phalaenopsis is approximately 79.41mm2/day when the temperature and relative humidity in the greenhouse are controlled at 28.83±2.58 (°C) and 71.81±8.88 (%RH), respectively. The proposed system shows a great potential to provide quantitative information with high spatiotemporal resolution to floral farmers. It is promisingly expected that the proposed system will effectively contribute to updating farming strategies for Phalaenopsis in the future.",

The huge amount of data generated for these systems require high computing capabilities only available in Data Centers.

Low-power techniques are applied in monitorization nodes. Techniques such us: on-node signal processing and radio policies to make node’s autonomy longer and save energy, have been applied. Workload balancing policies are carried out in the coordinator nodes and Data Centers to reduce the computational burden in these facilities and minimize its energy consumption. Our results draw average savings of € 288 million in this eHealth scenario applied only to 2% of European migraine sufferers; in addition to savings of € 1272 million due to the benefits of the migraine prediction.",

It is often used in applications of Internet of Things (IoT), which have gained popularity in recent years, for example, tracking the daily activities of elderly people, and monitoring vital signs etc. The GPS signal which is extremely weak is affected by several types of errors in the course of its propagation. This situation becomes much worse particularly when the GPS receiver is located in dense urban areas where multipath effect is strongly pronounced. The received signal strength of a GPS satellite at a given location can be predicted by analyzing the propagation characteristics of the channel with an appropriate propagation model. In this paper, we propose a simple MATLAB model to estimate the received signal strength of a GPS signal in varying urban environment based on experimental measurements of the propagation characteristics of GPS signal taken in the city of Izmir, Turkey.",

In this work, we present a solution to guarantee the authentication of augmented objects with NFC tags disseminated in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Security against counterfeiting of Tags associated with objects is precarious when IoT solutions do not make use of mobile applications to interact with these objects. While mobile applications make it possible to use secure Tags that store information in user-defined formats that are only recognized by a mobile application, this is not possible when IoT solutions are based on Web applications that make use of the NFC controller of mobile devices. Therefore, these NFC solutions are subject to possible falsifications of the NFC Tags that make it impossible to apply them to areas where the authentication of the Tags is required. The proposal presented in this work combines the use of beacons (BLE) and the physical Web for the authentication of the Tags. Beacons are used to guarantee the location of users and the broadcast of URLs that are received by users through the physical Web. These URLs, once validated, are responsible for generating credentials that authenticate the NFC Tags and guarantee the secure interactions of the users in IoT scenarios.",

As the information from the sensors are transmitted via public network and sensor nodes have limited battery, shift the focus on security and efficiency in WSNs. User authentication is the security task for limiting the access. It is achieved by equipping authorized users with passwords, tokens or biometrics. However, password and token are easy being stolen and forgotten; even biometrics inherit some limitation. More suitable approach is to combine both password and biometric authenticator to harvest benefits in security. This paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs using biohashing. Biohashing facilitates elimination of false accept rates without increasing occurrence of false rejection rate. Additionally, biohashing has highly clear separation of imposter populations and genuine, and zero equal error rate level. The proposed scheme also supports dynamic node addition and user friendly password change mechanism. Using the BAN-logic, we prove that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication. In addition, we simulate proposed scheme for the security against man-in-the middle attack and replay attack using the AVISPA tool, and the simulation results show that our scheme is safe. Through the informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against the known attacks for authentication protocols.",

The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics.",

In this paper, we analyze this issue by contemplating the concept of IoT and drawing an inspiration towards the perspective vision of ‘Internet of Multimedia Things’ (IoMT). Therein, we introduce IoMT as a novel paradigm in which smart heterogeneous multimedia things can interact and cooperate with one another and with other things connected to the Internet to facilitate multimedia based services and applications that are globally available to the users. Some applications and use-cases for IoMT are presented to reflect the possibilities enabled by this new paradigm. An IoMT architecture is then presented which is segregated into four distinct stages; (i) multimedia sensing, (ii) reporting and addressability, (iii) multimedia-aware cloud, and (iv) multi-agent systems. Instead of proposing specific technical solutions for each individual stage of the presented architecture, we survey the already existing technologies, providing a synthesis for the realization of the vision of IoMT. Subsequently, various requirements and challenges as well as the feasibility of existing solutions for each stage of proposed IoMT architecture are comprehensively discussed.",

To address this challenge, this article proposes a service-oriented wireless sensor networks (WSNs) framework, and the cooperation between sensor nodes is achieved through the functional integration of neighboring sensor nodes. Generally, sensor nodes are encapsulated and represented as WSN services, which are energy-aware, and typically have constraints on their spatial and temporal aspects. WSN services are categorized into service classes according to the limited number of types of their functionalities. Consequently, service classes chains are generated with respect to the requirement of domain applications, and the composition of WSN services is constructed through discovering and selecting appropriate WSN services as the instantiation of service classes contained in chains. This WSN services composition is reduced to a multi-objective and multi-constrained optimization problem, which can be solved through adopting particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). Experimental evaluation shows that PSO outperforms GA in finding approximately optimal WSN services compositions.",

abstract = "The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased the appetite for the energy efficient wireless infrastructures. Most of the IoT devices are inherently resource constrained and heterogeneous in respect of their traffic demand. Moreover, these devices need to be made adaptable to the varying environmental conditions. However, existing traffic scheduling and duty cycling algorithms lack the capability to meet the dynamic service quality requirements of IoT applications with variable context information. Specifically, they are infeasible for IoT use-cases where multi-hop communication is required. This paper strives to realize efficient resource allocation to the Wi-Fi based IoT devices in multi-hop IoT infrastructures. Firstly, IoT applications are characterized as per their heterogeneous traffic demand and mapped to the distinct weighted quality classes. Then, context awareness is introduced for IoT devices and an optimization model constrained by their service quality requirements and context priorities is presented. Further, an energy efficient context aware traffic scheduling (EE-CATS) algorithm is proposed wherein the convergence of model is specified by a sub-gradient projection method. The EE-CATS algorithm efficiently allocates resources to multi-hop IoT devices and reduce their total awake time by employing adaptive duty cycling. The performance evaluation is done for various IoT use-cases through simulations in Network Simulator (ns-2) and testbed implementation in Contiki operating system. The results suggest substantial improvements in the energy efficiency of IoT devices while ensuring their dynamic service requirements. In addition, the proposed algorithm minimizes the end-to-end delays in overall IoT networks.",

abstract = "Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is a novel class of Internet of Things applications which exploits the inherent mobility of wearable sensors and mobile devices to observe phenomena of common interest, typically over large geographical areas (e.g. traffic conditions, air pollution, noise in urban areas). Since MCS applications generate large amounts of sensed data which is collected and preprocessed by devices with limited energy supply, challenges arise with respect to sensor management to ensure an energy-aware and quality-driven data acquisition process. In this paper we present a framework for Green Mobile Crowd Sensing (G-MCS) which utilizes a quality-driven sensor management function to continuously select the k-best sensors for a predefined sensing task. Our G-MCS solution utilizes a cloud-based architecture centered around a publish/subscribe communication model to enable the interaction of mobile devices with the cloud for energy-aware MCS. In particular, it obviates redundant sensor activity while satisfying sensing coverage requirements and sensing quality, and consequently reduces the overall energy consumption of an MCS application. We present a model for G-MCS and evaluate its energy savings for different application requirements and geographical sensor distribution scenarios. Furthermore, our model evaluation on a real data set shows that in certain identified cases, significant energy consumption reductions can be achieved by utilizing the proposed framework, which opens the door for green solutions within the area of MCS applications.",

The earliest computer systems are centralized mainframe computers. The paradigm moved to decentralized as networked stations became more dependable, extensible and cost-effective. The decentralized systems have their limitations and inconveniences. The virtualization and cloud computing paradigm creates a centralized system that appears to users to be a centralized system, where computing and communication resources are not in the client computers but in an integrated infrastructure that is accessible anywhere and anytime. Nevertheless, the implementation of the centralized infrastructure is equipped with decentralized and redundant resources, which makes the system more dependable as any component failures can be tolerated internally. The Internet of Things extends the cloud computing concept beyond computing and communication to include everything, particularly, the physical devices. This paper discusses the architectures, interfaces, and behaviors of intelligent devices connected to the cloud computing environment. Robot as a Service is the case study, which has all the key features of Internet of Intelligent Things: autonomous, mobile, sensing, and action taking. The goal is to further extend the centralized cloud computing environment into a decentralized system to complete another cycle of the spiral development. The idea of achieving the goal is through autonomous and intelligent mobile physical services or robots as services to form local pool of intelligent devices and that can make local decisions without communicate with the cloud.",

The technology's ability to precisely identify objects at low cost and without line of sight creates new and emerging opportunities for RFID applications that could become an integral part of our daily lives. Mobile RFID services for the Internet of Things can be created using RFID as an enabling technology in mobile devices. This pervasiveness enables embedded systems to interact with the user continuously, providing data from their sensors and responding to requests from the users too. Humans, devices and things are both the content providers and users of these mobile services. Mobile RFID services can be either provided on mobile devices applications as stand-alone services or combined with legacy and end-to-end systems. However, to develop and deploy this kind of system, it is necessary for an effective software development infrastructure to be able to deal with the restrictions and limitations imposed by related business areas, RFID and pervasive applications. This work presents a software framework architecture for mobile devices that aims to facilitate the development process of embedded RFID applications and the integration process of business applications and EPC Network instances. The framework provides for applications a common communication interface to abstract different devices and reading protocols as well as functions to process and distribute data.",

A MBAN includes a set of sensor nodes deployed such, they can be located on, in, or around the patient body. They are used to monitor physiological signs, which are transmitted then to medical servers without hampering the patient activities. Security is one of the main challenging issues in MBANs since the data nature is highly sensitive. In order to ensure the reliable gathering of patient critical information, it is vital to provide authentication to prevent an attacker from impersonating legitimate sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a patient body motion based authentication solution. The routine activities, as walking or running, are characterized through a generic model allowing to identify the patient sensor nodes. Through the security analysis, we show its robustness against the well known attacks. In addition, we develop an analytical model to measure the impact of physical and logical attacks on the proposed solution with comparison to the existing protocols. We also evaluate the proposed solution through simulations with respect of important criteria, namely the transmission overhead, response time and energy consumption. The proposed solution demonstrates the best results in performance with comparison to the existing protocols. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype of the proposed solution, where it demonstrates promising results in terms of true acceptation and false rejection.",

A novel classifier or predicator equipped with a good feature selection function contributes effectively to classification and prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel bagging C4.5 algorithm based on wrapper feature selection, for the purpose of supporting wise clinical decision-making in the medical and healthcare fields. In particular, the new proposed sampling method, S-C4.5-SMOTE, is not only able to overcome the problem of data distortion, but also improves overall system performance because its mechanism aims at effectively reducing the data size without distortion, by keeping datasets balanced and technically smooth.

Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data streams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains, and accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is recognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing continuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to relational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query specification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with higher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across temporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow accessible analytics over data streams having properties from different disciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent) dimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (χ-CEP ) framework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with temporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and persistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution over online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to mitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in accessing high-volume historic data streams. In particular, we also address temporal consistency issues that arise during fault recovery of query plans that span the boundary between real-time and persistent streams. The proposed χ-CEP query model and execution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine, SCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a real-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the benefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams from a campus-microgrid IoT deployment. Our results show that we are able to sustain a processing throughput of 3,000  events/secs for χ-CEP queries, a 30× improvement over the baseline and sufficient to support a Smart Township, and can resume consistent processing within 20  secs after stream outages as long as 2 hours.",

IoT makes it possible to convert our homes to smart environments in which sensors are responsible for handling inhabitants’ behaviours and monitor their daily activities. Activity Recognition (AR) is a new service within smart homes. It has been introduced as a solution to improve the quality of life of people such as elderly and children. AR is concerned with the assignment of an activity label to a sequence of sensors’ events that are generated from the smart infrastructure. To help in effectively recognizing home activities, classification algorithms are applied on segmented sequences that are extracted automatically. Segments are subject to error due to the existence of irrelevant data and difficulties in how segmentation is applied. This negatively affects the accuracy on the classification task. In addition, the data generated from the network is streamed in nature, and big data techniques need to be utilized. In this paper, we propose a model to improve Activity Recognition in smart homes. The proposed technique is based on defining a profile for each activity from training datasets. The profile will be used to induce extra features and will help in distinguishing residents’ activities (fingerprinting). To validate our model, real datasets have been used for the experiments, and results show a significant enhancement in accuracy, compared with traditional techniques.",

The introduction of a high level of wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects, providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary curved surface over their stiff counterparts without incurring damage, emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force, temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization), further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory, signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major research frontiers in recent years.

To address some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to the IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT), which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large-scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be considered in the design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying a suitable “Middleware” which sits between things and applications as a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and characteristics of middlewares. Next, we study different architecture styles and service domains.

At the MAC level, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines a reservation mechanism called Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) that uses a first-come first-served service policy, which is not enough to ensure the real-time delivery of packets.

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure. Improved accuracies of classifiers on U2R and R2L attacks have been recorded in the experimental results obtained for experiments conducted.",

Industrial automation systems, wireless sensor networks, mobile robots and vehicular networks are just a sample of cyber-physical systems. Typically, CPSs have limited computation and storage capabilities due to their tiny size and being embedded into larger systems. With the emergence of cloud computing and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there are several new opportunities for these CPSs to extend their capabilities by taking advantage of the cloud resources in different ways. In this survey paper, we present an overview of research efforts on the integration of cyber-physical systems with cloud computing and categorize them into three areas: (1) remote brain, (2) big data manipulation, (3) and virtualization. In particular, we focus on three major CPSs namely mobile robots, wireless sensor networks and vehicular networks.",

abstract = "Purpose
Big data is increasingly becoming a major organizational enterprise force to reckon with in this global era for all sizes of industries. It is a trending new enterprise system or platform which seemingly offers more features for acquiring, storing and analysing voluminous generated data from various sources to obtain value-additions. However, current research reveals that there is limited agreement regarding the performance of “big data.” Therefore, this paper attempts to thoroughly investigate “big data,” its application and analysis in operations or supply-chain management, as well as the trends and perspectives in this research area. This paper is organized in the form of a literature review, discussing the main issues of “big data” and its extension into “big data II”/IoT–value-adding perspectives by proposing a value-adding framework.
Methodology/research approach
The research approach employed is a comprehensive literature review. About 100 or more peer-reviewed journal articles/conference proceedings as well as industrial white papers are reviewed. Harzing Publish or Perish software was employed to investigate and critically analyse the trends and perspectives of “big data” applications between 2010 and 2015.
Findings/results
The four main attributes or factors identified with “big data” include – big data development sources (Variety – V1), big data acquisition (Velocity – V2), big data storage (Volume – V3), and finally big data analysis (Veracity – V4). However, the study of “big data” has evolved and expanded a lot based on its application and implementation processes in specific industries in order to create value (Value-adding – V5) – “Big Data cloud computing perspective/Internet of Things (IoT)”. Hence, the four Vs of “big data” is now expanded into five Vs.
Originality/value of research
This paper presents original literature review research discussing “big data” issues, trends and perspectives in operations/supply-chain management in order to propose “Big data II” (IoT – Value-adding) framework. This proposed framework is supposed or assumed to be an extension of “big data” in a value-adding perspective, thus proposing that “big data” be explored thoroughly in order to enable industrial managers and businesses executives to make pre-informed strategic operational and management decisions for increased return-on-investment (ROI). It could also empower organizations with a value-adding stream of information to have a competitive edge over their competitors.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) is intended to provide a network where information flows could easily be set up between any kinds of products, devices, users and information systems in general. This vision is getting closer to become real due to the continuous development of new information system concepts and technologies. Nonetheless, this new reality requires special attention on particular aspects of the IoT such as security and mobility. First, people and companies want to secure their assets/data using firewalls, which inevitably leads to a challenging conflict between data security and usability. Second, products are becoming increasingly mobile, operating in environments where it can be difficult to contact them directly using their IP address (e.g., due to the presence of NAT or to access restrictions). It might therefore be necessary in some IoT applications to enable two-way communications through any type of firewall, e.g. to enable real-time control and maintenance. Quantum Lifecycle Management (QLM) messaging standards have been designed to provide generic and standardized application-level interfaces for the IoT that make it possible, among other things, to achieve such two-way communication. This paper provides a high-level description of QLM messaging standards with a particular focus on this QLM feature, along with proofs-of-concept through real-life implementations in building and automotive domains.",

Our model is based on a hierarchical clustering method and an aggregation/rejection mechanism, that follows sociological and heuristics theories. The model follows the principle of sense of community and the logic of tie for similarity. The main target is to integrate the inherent cooperation of a multi-agent system with node intelligence of Internet of Things and also with the “Satisficing” of heuristic decisions in order to get a social smart behavior of the whole network.",

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.",

Also, when the accuracy of data is most importantly in the Internet of Things, detecting sensor data with faulty readings is an important issue of secure communication and power consumption. So, requirement of energy-efficiency and integrity of information is mandatory. Thus, cryptography is an effective technique that provides integrity to sensed data. In contrast, we can’t simply transferred traditional cryptographic techniques to WSNs due to sensors constraints. This paper, deals with the proposition of a novel energy-efficient and data integrity version of LEACH based routing protocol on Watermarking for wireless sensor networks because LEACH routing protocol does not take the security aspect into consideration and the secure improved LEACH works are based only on cryptographic techniques. Our hybrid proposed approach based on the Watermarking-LEACH achieves not only data integrity but also Energy-Efficient. It is the first schema that attempts to add security based on watermarking to LEACH routing protocol. To this end, we simulated and evaluated our WSN before and after falsification and we implemented our Watermarking-LEACH approach to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of integrity by evaluating the false negative rate (FNR) and in terms of energy-efficient through computing the energy consumption and compared its performance against other works by evaluating remaining energy metric across using the COOJA Simulator.",

To secure the communications, secret session keys need to be established between home appliances. In existing symmetric key establishment protocols, it is assumed that devices are pre-loaded with secrets. In practice, however, home appliances are manufactured by different companies. As a result, it is not a practical assumption that the appliances are pre-loaded with certain secrets when they leave companies. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents a matrix-based cross-layer key establishment protocol without the secret sharing assumption. Specifically, in our protocol, home appliances extract master keys (shared with the home gateway) at the physical layer using the wireless fading channels. Then, the home gateway distributes key seeds for home appliances by making use of the extracted master keys. Completing these operations, any two appliances can directly establish a secret session key at higher layers. Additionally, we prove the security of the proposed protocol and analyse the performance of it by comparing the new protocol with other closely related protocols. The comparison shows that appliances in our protocol can establish secret session keys when they do not pre-share any secrets, and it is achieved without introducing significant energy consumptions.",

Experts in the purchasing and management of hospital supplies (administrative and clinical) were invited to participate at different stages of the ontology-based system development. As a result of the first stage, the HealthCatalog ontology was developed. This ontology models generic items included in a health catalog and their management. Secondly, a further refinement of the ontology was conducted by specifically studying the case of gloves. Twenty-seven references of different glove types were modeled and included in the ontology during the stage two. A prototype was then developed as a proof of concept and for the evaluation of the ontology. Finally, a usability evaluation was planned to improve the ontology and obtain feedback from experts after testing the system. Experts involved in the evaluation stressed its potential use in a real clinical environment and the benefits it would bring in terms of cost and sharing knowledge among clinical personnel. Our proposed ontology-based system provides an understandable and organized solution to capture knowledge regarding item management and usage. It addresses the integration challenge of health catalogs while providing a framework for collaborative sharing and knowledge acquisition among clinicians.",

In this study, we use “Tech Mining,” a systematic analytical method based on structured texts applied to publication and patent abstract data, to analyze potential applications of TENGs. A series of applications from product scale to industry scale are identified. The findings show that when used as sensors, TENGs are mostly applicable in automation and energy-intensive industries such as automotive, medical or surgical devices, consumer electronics and household appliances. TENGs in the form of sensors can also be integrated with future-oriented and exponentially growing technologies such as robotics, drones, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics that will create enormous value for future economies. Moreover, applications of TENGs as sensors are also in line with current global trends of science and technology development, including the “Internet of Things,” big data, clean energy, and smart cities. Combined with those technologies and industries, TENGs can help in tackling challenges of global warming, environmental pollution and security systems. We suggest the TENG research community to widen interdisciplinary collaboration, pursue connections with industry, and file more patents as R&D progresses. In addition, research limitations and future development directions of TENG are pointed out.",

abstract = "The expansion of big data and the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have played an important role in the feasibility of smart city initiatives. Big data offer the potential for cities to obtain valuable insights from a large amount of data collected through various sources, and the IoT allows the integration of sensors, radio-frequency identification, and Bluetooth in the real-world environment using highly networked services. The combination of the IoT and big data is an unexplored research area that has brought new and interesting challenges for achieving the goal of future smart cities. These new challenges focus primarily on problems related to business and technology that enable cities to actualize the vision, principles, and requirements of the applications of smart cities by realizing the main smart environment characteristics. In this paper, we describe the state-of-the-art communication technologies and smart-based applications used within the context of smart cities. The visions of big data analytics to support smart cities are discussed by focusing on how big data can fundamentally change urban populations at different levels. Moreover, a future business model of big data for smart cities is proposed, and the business and technological research challenges are identified. This study can serve as a benchmark for researchers and industries for the future progress and development of smart cities in the context of big data.",

abstract = "A novel miniaturised photometer has been developed as an ultra-portable and mobile analytical chemical instrument. The low-cost photometer presents a paradigm shift in mobile chemical sensor instrumentation because it is built around a contactless smart card format. The photometer tag is based on the radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart card system, which provides short-range wireless data and power transfer between the photometer and a proximal reader, and which allows the reader to also energise the photometer by near field electromagnetic induction. RFID is set to become a key enabling technology of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), hence devices such as the photometer described here will enable numerous mobile, wearable and vanguard chemical sensing applications in the emerging connected world. In the work presented here, we demonstrate the characterisation of a low-power RFID wireless sensor tag with an LED/photodiode-based photometric input. The performance of the wireless photometer has been tested through two different model analytical applications. The first is photometry in solution, where colour intensity as a function of dye concentration was measured. The second is an ion-selective optode system in which potassium ion concentrations were determined by using previously well characterised bulk optode membranes. The analytical performance of the wireless photometer smart tag is clearly demonstrated by these optical absorption-based analytical experiments, with excellent data agreement to a reference laboratory instrument.",

To bridge this gap, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) released a set of specifications for a common M2M service platform. In this paper, we propose the open source OM2M project, an autonomic ETSI-compliant M2M service platform. OM2M provides a RESTful API to enhance interoperability. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It enables multiple communication protocols binding, reuse of existing remote devices management mechanisms, and interworking with existing legacy devices. Addressing the M2M complexity issue, a new M2M service based on the autonomic computing paradigm and semantic models is defined to provide dynamic discovery and reconfiguration mechanisms.",

As a key application of IoT, wireless body area networks (WBANs) provides people high quality of life and high level of medical service. However, due to the sensitiveness of medical system, security and privacy issues in WBANs are very important. In previous research, there are no comprehensive authentication protocols designed for WBANs according to its characteristics of network structure. In this paper, we propose an efficient multilayer authentication protocol and a secure session key generation method for WBANs. Firstly, we design a one-to-many group authentication protocol and a group key establishment algorithm between personal digital assistance (PDA) and each of sensor nodes with energy efficiency and low computational cost. Then, we present a new certificateless authentication protocol with no pairings based on certificateless cryptography between PDA and application provider (AP), using ECC algorithm that provides low computational cost with high security. In addition, the validation of the proposed protocol can be proved. Finally, the security and performance analysis shows that our protocol is secure and efficient.",

Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology.

Among the main results of our study, we highlight that those public services properly managed embedding IoT technology convey cost reductions in the long term. There is also a reduction in energy consumption and environmental impact with the consequent social impact. It should also be highlighted that most data are managed with the same platform.

This question is important because of the protection given to data in law and ethics. Healthcare data are universally considered sensitive (and confidential), so it might seem that the categorisation of less sensitive data is relatively unimportant for medical data research. This paper will explore the arguments that this is not necessarily the case and the relevance of recognizing this. The categorization of data and information requires re-evaluation in the age of Big Data in order to ensure that the appropriate protections are given to different types of data. The aggregation of large amounts of data requires an assessment of the harms and benefits that pertain to large datasets linked together, rather than simply assessing each datum or dataset in isolation. Big Data produce new data via inferences, and this must be recognized in ethical assessments. We propose a schema for a granular assessment of data categories. The use of schemata such as this will assist decision-making by providing research ethics committees and information governance bodies with guidance about the relative sensitivities of data. This will ensure that appropriate and proportionate safeguards are provided for data research subjects and reduce inconsistency in decision making.",

In many WSN applications, flooding is a fundamental network service for remote network configuration, diagnosis or disseminating code updates. Despite a plethora of research on flooding problem in the literature, there has been very limited research on flooding tree construction in asynchronous low-duty-cycle WSNs. In this paper, we focus our investigation on minimum-delay and energy-efficient flooding tree construction considering the duty-cycle operation and unreliable wireless links. We show the existence of the latency-energy trade-off in flooding. We formulate the problem as a undetermined-delay-constrained minimum spanning tree (UDC-MST) problem, where the delay constraint is known a posteriori. Due to the NP-completeness of the UDC-MST problem, we design a distributed Minimum-Delay Energy-efficient flooding Tree (MDET) algorithm to construct an energy optimal tree with flooding delay bounding. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that MDET achieves a comparable delivery latency with the minimum-delay flooding, and incurs only 10% more transmission cost than the lower bound, which yields a good balance between flooding delay and energy efficiency.",

abstract = "With the rapid development of device-to-device and machine-to-machine communication, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications, such as intelligent transportation systems, smart e-healthcare, and smart education. In these applications, various devices can be identified using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags, which can be used for transferring the collected data to other local or remote objects at various geographical locations. However, for automatic reading of data accumulated in an RFID-tag embedded in an object/device, authentication is required at various stages for the aforementioned applications. In RFID-based systems for smart applications, an RFID-tag may be operated from several meters distance and it does not require to be put within direct line-of-sight of the reader like a barcode system. Therefore, the traditional barcode system will be replaced by the RFID authentication system in near future since in the later, technology reading of a large amount of data within short span is possible. However, in existing RFID-based authentication systems, an adversary may access the RFID-tag information, which can compromise the privacy and it may also create forgery problems. In addition, RFID-based authentication is suffering from heavy computation burden since an RFID-tag has very limited computation capability. To address these issues, lots of anonymous RFID-based authentication schemes have been designed using lightweight cryptographic tools, e.g., the hash function and symmetric key encryption. However, all these schemes failed to achieve known security and functionality requirements. Motivated by the above-mentioned issues, in this paper, we have put forwarded an RFID-based authentication architecture for distributed IoT (Internet of Things) applications suitable for the future smart city environments. Subsequently, we have put forwarded a lightweight RFID-based authentication scheme to provide reasonable execution time compared to existing schemes. Our scheme provides forward secrecy, anonymity and untraceability of RFID-tag, and secure localization. In summary, the proposed scheme can be used in wide range of applications in smart city environments.",

For example, the world witnesses 15 million stroke patients each year. These individuals face a number of gait abnormalities including drop foot that is a pathological condition, limiting patients’ ability to lift the foot from the ground during the swing phase of walking. In this research work, we introduce a novel smart textile system, MagicSox that is woven with multiple sensors distributed over the surface of the foot. The overarching goal of MagicSox is to quantify the gait abnormalities in remote settings such as patients’ homes so that clinicians and physical therapists can assess their patients on daily basis. The paper provides a detailed architecture of MagicSox that leverages the computing and communication capabilities of a modern internet of things (IoT) processor, Intel Curie. We have developed an Android smartphone app that uses Bluetooth low energy and automates the multi-sensor data collection from MagicSox. In the algorithmic front, we adopted multiplication of backward differences (MOBD) to analyze the multi-modal time series data to distinguish drop foot events from normal walking cycles. We pursued a usability study on healthy participants who were asked to walk normally and also to simulate drop foot cycles. We developed support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to analyze the data. The classification resulted in the accuracy of drop foot detection varying from 71.78%−98.38%. The promising results now encourage us to evaluate MagicSox on stroke patients in future studies.",

abstract = "Disease outbreaks are becoming a primary concern for many countries due to the recent cases of MERS, Ebola to name a few. Preventive measures can be taken into account when proper information about an outbreak is disseminated among the masses. Social media plays a crucial role during disease outbreaks. Saudi Arabia topped worldwide in terms of twitter usage. There are number of issues related to mining twitter for disease information including, filtering noisy information, establishing dictionary of terms to be used, sentiment analysis and establishing authenticity. In this project, we plan to develop a framework for mining and extracting information from twitter related to disease outbreaks. The system makes use of numerous programming interfaces as part of the framework to identify and notify the user of pertinent health related issues in a geographical area of interest. The framework is part of a smart home dashboard system that notifies the user about disease outbreak information. The smart home dashboard provides an effective human-home collaboration interface to the user.",

In this paper, we develop a novel healthcare recommendation system called iDoctor, which is based on hybrid matrix factorization methods. iDoctor differs from previous work in the following aspects: (1) emotional offset of user reviews can be unveiled by sentiment analysis and be utilized to revise original user ratings; (2) user preference and doctor feature are extracted by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and incorporated into conventional matrix factorization. We compare iDoctor with previous healthcare recommendation methods using real datasets. The experimental results show that iDoctor provides a higher predication rating and increases the accuracy of healthcare recommendation significantly.",

abstract = "Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness.",

abstract = "Fog Computing, a technology that takes advantage of both the paradigms of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, has a great advantage in reducing the communication cost. Since its introduction, fog computing has found a lot of applications, including, for instance, connected vehicles, wireless sensors, smart cities and etc. One prominent problem in fog computing is how fine-grained access control can be imposed. Functional encryption, a new cryptographic primitive, is known to support fine-grained access control. However, when it comes to some new threats in the fog computing scenario, such as side channel attacks, functional encryption cannot maintain its security. Therefore, we need new cryptographic primitives that not only provide a way to securely share data with a fine-grained access control but also are able to resist those new threats. In this paper, we consider how to construct functional encryption schemes (FEs) adaptively secure in continual memory leakage model (CML), which is one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master secret keys. Besides providing privacy and fine-grained access control in fog computing, our scheme can also guarantee security against side channel attacks. More concretely, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure leakage-resilient FEs (LR-FEs) in the CML model results from leakage-resilient pair encoding, which is an extension of pair encoding presented in the recent work of Attrapadung. In this way, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Moreover, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs, including FE for regular languages, attribute-based encryption (ABE) for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. Above all, leakage-resilient adaptively secure functional encryption schemes can equip fog computing with higher security and fine-grained access control.",

To this end, two different scenarios are implemented using the Cooja simulator. The first one is based on group models. The second scenario is based on the entity mobility models. Our simulation results show that RPL performances are greatly influenced by the number of nodes, the number of sink nodes, and the mobility type. The scalability of the network increases all metrics while providing less packet loss. Additionally, the number of sink nodes directly affects the RPL performances. The energy consumption is reduced in the case of multiple sink nodes by 55.86%, which is less than the case of a single sink.",

These computing elements are usually wireless, interconnected to share data and interact with each other, with the server part and also with cloud computing services. In such a heterogeneous environment, new applications arise to meet ever-increasing needs and these are an important challenge to the processing capabilities of devices. For example, automatic driving systems, manufacturing environments, smart city management, etc. To meet the requirements of said application contexts, the system can create computing processes to distribute the workload over the network and/or a cloud computing server. Multiple options arise in relation to what network nodes should support the execution of the processes. This paper focuses on this problem by introducing a distributed computational model to dynamically share these tasks among the computing nodes and considering the inherent variability of the context in these environments. Our novel approach promotes the integration of the computing resources, with externally supplied cloud services, to fulfill modern application requirements. A prototype implementation for the proposed model has been built and an application example has been designed to validate the proposal in a real working environment.",

Not surprisingly in an area of innovation, definitions are evolving, overlapping and inconsistent. This paper analyses and consolidates the literature in order to identify the key aspects of this new phenomenon. We have coined the term “eObjects”1 for the central element of the “third wave”. The paper presents a framework for research into the technologies and their implications, distinguishing core from common attributes, and identifying categories of inter-device interaction. A subsequent paper will apply the research framework to legal research, with the intention of understanding areas in which litigation can be anticipated, and uncovering areas where the law may not adequately deal with emergent social and business practices.",

Structured key-based private authentication protocols securely identify individual RF tags in the logarithmic order by having group keys shared by several tags. However, should some portion of tags in the system be physically compromised, the degree of privacy of the other tags will decrease. This is because tampered group keys disclosed from the compromised tags can be correlated. Thus, preserving the degree of tags’ privacy in keeping with fast authentication speed is equivalent to reducing the correlation probability of group keys. Toward this goal, we propose Randomized Skip Graphs-Based Authentication (RSGA) that significantly improves the tags’ privacy in terms of anonymity with reasonable amount of key storage cost by using a skip graph key structure. Then, we augment RSGA with a key updating mechanism to securely update secret keys and a path pruning algorithm to further facilitate its authentication process. Our extensive computer simulation as well as mathematical analyses present that the proposed RSGA achieves its design goals.",

With the changing healthcare landscape and push for value-based care, adoption of these digital health initiatives among providers is bound to increase. Although so far there is a dearth of published evidence about effectiveness of these apps in gastroenterology care, there are ongoing trials to determine whether remote patient monitoring can lead to improvement in process metrics or outcome metrics for patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases.",

The chemical sensor part of the smart card comprises a planar conductometric interface onto which a chemically or biologically sensitive thin film may be cast using microfabrication techniques. The thin film sensor and conductometric interface form an integral part of a radio-frequency smart card that has been designed for use in distributed chemical and biological detection systems, and which is based upon the International Standards Organisation high-frequency (HF) ISO 15693 radio-frequency identification (RFID) protocol. Conductometric measurements are controlled, sampled and stored by the smart card electronics. Measurement results achieved with an organic semiconductor, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT-PSS, as a model thin film conductometric sensor material cast on planar gold electrodes are reported. The standardisation of short-range wireless radio protocols such as Bluetooth, RuBee, ZigBee, WiFi and RFID is opening new markets for distributed sensors and sensor networks, and the fusion of chemical and biosensor technologies with short-range, low-cost, wireless technologies will create new opportunities for chemical and biological sensor systems in healthcare, environmental monitoring, process and quality control, and chemical and biological threat detection.

The evaluation of the proposed system in terms of the interpret-ability and accuracy of the generated data models for classifying health-shock shows promising results.

Their security, in a world where the Internet of Things has become a reality, is paramount to the continued safety of patients that are dependent upon these devices. The international standard ISO/IEC 80001 – Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices presents a unified and amalgamated approach to the safety of medical devices connected to IT networks. Whilst this standard presents a guide for security and risk management in health delivery organisations, its effectiveness with regard to contemporary cybersecurity is unknown. This research employed a structured review process to compare and analyse the ISO/IEC 80001 technical controls standards (ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 and ISO/IEC 80001-2-8), with contemporary cybersecurity best practice, guidelines and standards. The research deconstructed the technical controls and drew links between these standards and cybersecurity best practice to assess the level of harmonisation. Subsequently, a deeper analysis identified the areas of omission, coverage, addition or improvement that may impact the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 80001 to provide effective cybersecurity protection. ISO/IEC 80001 aims to provide a minimal level of cybersecurity however this research demonstrates that there are deficiencies in the standard and identifies the important aspects of cybersecurity that could be improved. This situation has arisen due to the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment and the protracted time to revise and republish international standards. This research identified several areas that require urgent consideration, including Emergency Access, Health Data De-Identification, Physical Locks on Devices, Data Backup, Disaster Recovery, Third-Party Components in Product Lifecycle Roadmap, Transmission Confidentiality, and Transmission Integrity. The research will provide health delivery organisations implementing ISO/IEC 80001, assurance as to the level of protection supplied by the ISO/IEC 80001 standard, and the areas that may need enhancement to increase cybersecurity protection and consequently increase in patient safety. Further, the outcomes are expected to influence development of the related international standard, as the findings from this research are being provided to the International Organisations for Standardisation, TC215 Health Informatics, Joint Working Group 7, to inform the review of ISO/IEC 80001 currently in progress.",

The symptoms of MBDs are almost similar to each other which makes it quite difficult to diagnose the specific disease. However, it is required to diagnose the patient for proper treatment and continuous monitoring of infected patients to control the infection of MBDs. Healthcare services based on fog-cloud assisted cyber-physical system are emerging as a proactive and efficacious solution to provide remote monitoring and early detection of infected users suffering from MBDs. Fog-cloud based cyber-physical system facilitates the alliance of devices in the physical space i.e. smart wearables, IoT sensors and smart cameras with cyber space to generate the required information. Afterwards, it uses cyber space to assimilate, analyze and share medical information amongst users and healthcare service providers. A novel system based on IoT sensors, cloud computing and fog computing is proposed to distinguish, classify and monitor the users infected with MBDs. The objective of this system is to control the outbreak of MBDs at an early stage. In the proposed system, similarity factor is calculated to differentiate among MBDs and then J48 decision tree classifier is used to classify the category of infection for each user. The alerts are instantly generated and sent on user’s mobile from fog layer in case of any abnormality. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used to sense the close proximity between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to monitor and represent the current state of the MBDs outbreak using close proximity data. The experimental evaluations of the proposed system resulted in high accuracy and low error rate to distinguish the MBDs and also provided 94% classification accuracy. The results also reveal that the TNA is an efficient tool to evaluate the state of MBDs outbreak using various statistical parameters.",

Similarly, Amazon understands user preference and recommends items of interest to shop and so on. In this paper, we survey context aware computing systems from a Big data perspective. We first propose a taxonomy of existing work on the basis of sensing platforms and then discuss the latest developments in this field of Big data context aware systems focusing on how such systems deal with various Big data challenges.

M2M communications have different characteristics than human-to-human (H2H) communications. In this work, we propose a scalable, hybrid MAC protocol that will satisfy quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. The proposed MAC protocol organizes transmissions into frames. Each machine is assumed to generate probabilistically one or zero packet per frame. The model allows machines with different packet generation probabilities. This random packet generation enables modeling of both periodic and nonperiodic traffic. The generated traffic has been classified into different classes according to their packet loss tolerances. Each frame has been divided into a number of subframes each serving a class of traffic. Further, each subframe is divided into two subperiods one serving contention and the other reserved traffic of that class. We derived packet loss probability for each class of traffic. Then, we formulated a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) that minimizes frame length subject to packet loss requirements of different classes. We compare the performance of the proposed protocol with other protocols proposed for M2M communications, which shows that it achieves better performance for small packet sizes.",

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.",

It consists of economically powered, wireless and implanted medical monitoring sensor nodes, which are designed to continually collect the medical information of the target patients. Multichannel is often used in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes and the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention. The health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink node (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health emergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for multichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to meet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links. As a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the scheduled lossy links. Besides, potential collisions in the schedules also incur considerable delay in delivering the sensing data. In this paper, we propose a novel deadline-driven Link quality Aware Channel Assignment scheme (LACA), where link quality, deadlines and collisions are jointly considered. LACA prioritizes links with urgent deadlines and heavy collisions. Besides, LACA allows the exploitation of the spare slots for retransmissions on lossy links, which can further reduce the retransmission delay. Extensive simulation experiments show that compared to the existing approaches, LACA can better utilize the wireless spectrum and achieve higher packet delivery ratio before the deadline.",

abstract = "In this study, we have compared Germany's “Industry 4.0” and China's “Made-in-China 2025” and estimated China's locus in “Made-in-China 2025”. “Made-in-China 2025” has clear goals, measures and sector focus. Its guiding principles are to enhance industrial capability through innovation-driven manufacturing, optimize the structure of Chinese industry, emphasize quality over quantity, train and attract talent, and achieve green manufacturing and environment. Data show that currently China is no longer the lowest–cost labor market; it is being squeezed by newly emerging low-cost producers such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Meanwhile, China is not the strongest player in the high-tech arena; well-established industrialized nations, the US, Germany, and Japan, have all effectively deployed digital technology to create new industrial environments, produce new products, and improve their well-established brands. Having analyzed the data from the World Bank and China's National Bureau of Statistics, we find an upward trajectory in China in manufacturing capability development, research and development commitment, and human capital investment. However, implementing an ambitious strategic plan such as “Made-in-China 2025” is coupled with challenges. This research helps us understand the relationship between technological entrepreneurship and socio-economic changes in emerging economies such as China. Furthermore, the experience accumulated in China can be referenced by both emerging economies and developed nations to advance their technological entrepreneurship.",

Our perspectives are based on fundamental similarities between natural and business systems. We suggest that innovation ecosystems can be defined as pathways of interlinked business models. Pathways are characterised by the flows they convey not the types of business model that support the flows. These pathways convey material and informational resources, as well as value. Like the nutrient and energy pathways in natural ecosystems. Pathways help to recycle scarce resources such as customer attention and customer-derived information. Business model descriptions are similar to an organism's genome in that they describe limitations on sensing, acting and understanding. We conceptualise this as the ‘umwelt’; the self-world. These limitations have implications for how firms and customers interact with customers. They have other implications for how firms interact with each other in business model communities and how they accommodate each other. We illustrate and test these ecological perspectives using a case study of a healthcare smartphone app's ecosystem. We find that our perspectives can be used as novel methods of studying interactions between business models; or to study ecosystem building.",

To solve real-life industrial challenges, this paper presents a generic system architecture and its implementation along with the following dimensions. Firstly, a cloud-enabled platform for auction logistics center (CALC) is presented. It is proposed to implement efficient and effective ALPC, and to increase the flexibility in terms of execution of logistics operations and auction processes. Secondly, through the integration of IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud computing technologies, the proposed CALC creates a ubiquitous environment at the ALC, and establishes auction logistics services for different key stakeholders. The adaptive ALPC can be achieved with real-time visibility and traceability. Finally, this study presents a prototype of CALC to verify the proposed methodology. The case study in this paper also shows the potential of CALC to streamline operating processes in auction logistics environment.",

BSNs have wide application prospects in intelligent healthcare. Because physiological signals measured and processed by BSNs involve patient privacy, security mechanisms must be developed to secure BSNs, and therefore the adoption of available key negotiation protocols is fundamental. Due to stringently limited operation resources, BSNs require these protocols to be highly energy efficient. Recent development has discovered that certain physiological signals can be used for efficiently negotiating common keys among biosensor nodes. These signals and fuzzy technology are used to design lightweight key negotiation protocols, and many solutions have been proposed.

abstract = "Physical activity (PA) measurement is a crucial task in healthcare technology aimed at monitoring the progression and treatment of many chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA measures require relatively high cost and can only be conducted in controlled or semi-controlled environments, though they exhibit remarkable precision of PA monitoring outcomes. Recent advancement of commercial wearable devices and smartphones for recording one’s lifelogging PA has popularized data capture in uncontrolled environments. However, due to diverse life patterns and heterogeneity of connected devices as well as the PA recognition accuracy, lifelogging PA data measured by wearable devices and mobile phones contains much uncertainty thereby limiting their adoption for healthcare studies. To improve the feasibility of PA tracking datasets from commercial wearable/mobile devices, this paper proposes a lifelogging PA intensity pattern decision making approach for lifelong PA measures. The method is to firstly remove some irregular uncertainties (IU) via an Ellipse fitting model, and then construct a series of monthly based hour-day density map images for representing PA intensity patterns with regular uncertainties (RU) on each month. Finally it explores Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence fusing information from these density map images for generating a decision making model of a final personal lifelogging PA intensity pattern. The approach has significantly reduced the uncertainties and incompleteness of datasets from third party devices. Two case studies on a mobile personalized healthcare platform MHA [1] connecting the mobile app Moves are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed approach can improve effectiveness of PA tracking devices or apps for various types of people who frequently use them as a healthcare indicator.",

However, the labeling of data is costly and becomes infeasible when dealing with big data, such as those generated by Internet of Things applications. To this effect, building an ML model that learns from non-labeled or partially labeled data is of critical importance. This paper proposes a semi-supervised multi-layered clustering model (SMLC) for the detection and prevention of network intrusion. SMLC has the capability to learn from partially labeled data while achieving a detection performance comparable to that of supervised ML-based IDPS. The performance of SMLC is compared with that of a well-known semi-supervised model (tri-training) and of supervised ensemble ML models, namely RandomForest, Bagging, and AdaboostM1 on two benchmark network-intrusion datasets, NSL and Kyoto 2006+. Experimental results show that SMLC is superior to tri-training, providing a comparable detection accuracy with 20% less labeled instances of training data. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that our scheme has a detection accuracy comparable to that of the supervised ensemble models.",

Examples of such novel areas are Information Centric Network (ICN), Mobile ICN, Named Data Network (NDN), Internet of Things (IoT), etc. In this paper, we have surveyed those applications briefly and have proposed an alternate taxonomy for classifying existing DTN routing algorithms. The objective of this survey is to help future researchers to identify DTN specific properties in the new applications and to apply appropriate routing protocols whenever necessary. We have studied the relation between message replication and individual or group communication semantics of DTN routing protocols considering both social-based and opportunistic message forwarding techniques. We have also introduced an in-depth coverage of data dissemination protocols in DTN which can be adapted to content-centric networking domains.

abstract = "Fog Computing, which has the advantage of both the Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, has changed our daily lives. One important property of the Fog Computing is location awareness. To guarantee this property in a practical hostile environment, location verification protocols are always desired. However, few location verification protocols can protect the location privacy of the location prover, who attempts to prove that he or she is at some position or in some region. Even worse, to the best of our knowledge, no location verification protocol has considered how to protect the location privacy against the verifiers of the protocol, who verify whether the prover is telling the truth. In this paper, we solve this problem by giving constructions of secure positioning protocol with location privacy in the bounded retrieval model. More precisely, we first explore how to define location privacy, which requires that nearly all parties except the prover, including verifiers and outside attackers, cannot learn any additional information about the exact position of the prover, for secure positioning protocol in the bounded retrieval model. Then we illustrate how to construct protocols satisfying this definition. In particular, we present a construction in the one-dimension setting, which explains the basic idea of our construction, and a construction in the three-dimensions setting, which can capture most practical scenarios. Amazingly, privacy is achieved without introducing additional computation overhead, and our system is as efficient as the one constructed in Chandran et al. (CRYPTO 2009). Besides, based on our proposed secure positioning protocols with location privacy, we also build more advanced cryptographic protocols exploiting location verification, e.g., position based key exchange, position based multi-party computation, position based public key infrastructure, etc., all of which still preserve the location privacy. Finally, we also give a proof of concept implementation of our system, which demonstrates that our system is quite practical in practice.",

However, real social networks usually evolve over time and it remains a challenge to efficiently detect the k-cliques from dynamic social networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient k-clique dynamic detection theorem based on triadic formal concept analysis (TFCA) with completed mathematical proof. With this proposed detection theorem, we prove that the k-cliques detection problem is equivalent to finding the explicit k-cliques generated from k-triadic equiconcepts plus the implicit k-cliques derived from its high-order triadic equiconcepts. Theoretical analysis and experimental results illustrate that the proposed detection algorithm is efficient for finding the k-cliques and exploring the dynamic characteristics of the sub-structures in social networks.",

Extensive deployment and sustainability of integrated care services (ICS) constitute an unmet need to reduce the burden of chronic conditions. The European Union project NEXES (2008–2013) assessed the deployment of four ICS encompassing the spectrum of severity of chronic patients.
Objective
The current study aims to (i) describe the open source Adaptive Case Management (ACM) system (Linkcare®) developed to support the deployment of ICS at the level of healthcare district; (ii) to evaluate its performance; and, (iii) to identify key challenges for regional deployment of ICS.
Methods
We first defined a conceptual model for ICS management and execution composed of five main stages. We then specified an associated logical model considering the dynamic runtime of ACM. Finally, we implemented the four ICS as a physical model with an ICS editor to allow professionals (case managers) to play active roles in adapting the system to their needs. Instances of ICS were then run in Linkcare®. Four ICS provided a framework for evaluating the system: Wellness and Rehabilitation (W&R) (number of patients enrolled in the study (n)=173); Enhanced Care (EC) in frail chronic patients to prevent hospital admissions, (n=848); Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (HH/ED) (n=2314); and, Support to remote diagnosis (Support) (n=7793). The method for assessment of telemedicine applications (MAST) was used for iterative evaluation.
Results
Linkcare® supports ACM with shared-care plans across healthcare tiers and offers integration with provider-specific electronic health records. Linkcare® successfully contributed to the deployment of the four ICS: W&R facilitated long-term sustainability of training effects (,

abstract = "The impressive progress in sensing technology over the last few years has contributed to the proliferation and popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and to the adoption of Sensor Clouds for provisioning smart ubiquitous services. Also, the massive amount of data generated by sensors and smart objects led to a new kind of services known as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS). The quality of these services is highly dependent on the quality of sensed data (QoD), which is characterized by a number of quality attributes. DaaS provisioning is typically governed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between data consumers and DaaS providers. In this work, we propose a game-based approach for DaaS Provisioning, which relies on signaling based model for the negotiation of several QoD attributes between DaaS providers and data consumers. We consider that these entities are adaptive, rational, and able to negotiate the QoD offering even in the case of incomplete information about the other party. We use in the negotiation between the two parties a Q-learning algorithm for the signaling model and a Multi Attributes Decision Making (MADM) model to select the best signal. Moreover, we empirically validate the MADM model using Shannon’s entropy. The results obtained in the case of a multi-stages negotiation scenario show the convergence towards the pooling equilibrium.",

abstract = "Activity recognition is one of the emerging trends in the domain of mining ubiquitous environments. It assumes that we can recognize the current action undertaken by the monitored subject on the basis of outputs of a set of associated sensors. Often different combinations of smart devices are being used, thus creating an Internet of Things. Such data will arrive continuously during the operation time of sensors and require an online processing in order to keep a real-time track of the current activity being undertaken. This forms a natural data stream problem with the potential presence of changes in the arriving data. Therefore, we require an efficient online machine learning system that can offer high recognition rates and adapt to drifts and shifts in the stream. In this paper we propose an efficient and lightweight adaptive ensemble learning system for real-time activity recognition. We use a weighted modification of Naïve Bayes classifier that can swiftly adapt itself to the current state of the stream without a need for an external concept drift detector. To tackle the multi-class nature of activity recognition problem we propose to use an one-vs-one decomposition to form a committee of simpler and diverse learners. We introduce a novel weighted combination for one-vs-one decomposition that can adapt itself over time. Additionally, to limit the cost of supervision we propose to enhance our classification system with active learning paradigm to select only the most important objects for labeling and work under constrained budget. Experiments carried out on six data streams gathered from ubiquitous environments show that the proposed active and adaptive ensemble offer excellent classification accuracy with low requirement for access to true class labels.",

This study introduces an integrated assignment-allocation model that combines three issues: customer-facility assignments, allocation of fortification resources and data envelopment analysis (DEA). To justify the approach used to deal with a more reasonable solution for real world applications, we consider the outputs of the model as a function of the assignment variables. In new proposed model, the DEA efficiency measure is used to allocate fortification resources and select the best facilities for serving the customers after interdiction operations. For this purpose, we present a new bi-objective optimization model that optimally serves customers’ demands in a remarkably efficient manner and allocates fortification resources to relieve potential disaster, including interdiction operations. Also, Internet of Things (IoT) optimizes the performance of the customers and enhances the safety of facilities. Indeed, a new parking management system based on IoT is proposed to assist parking drivers in managing and handling parking in the presence of protection and interdiction operations considerably. The proposed model is multi-objective and Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP)-hard; so, a weighted metric approach by using the CPLEX solver through MATLAB and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) are utilized in problem solving. Several numerical instances are generated and solved by CPLEX and NSGA II. Experimental results show that NSGA II solves instances in considerably less time than CPLEX. Besides, it is seen that none of the solutions obtained by these two approaches are not dominated.",

In this paper, the proposed system can sense the changes of contexts and adapt the light status appropriately. For that aim, an ontology-based context model and a rule-based reasoning approach are designed to detect and infer the context changes.

Although the discovery process of traditional Bluetooth architecture has been intensively investigated through analytical and simulation models over the years, it cannot be applied to the BLE technology because of many changes introduced in the design of the BLE. Recently, there have been several works for performance evaluation of BLE discovery process, but they are not still thorough enough in providing a holistic analysis of the BLE. This has motivated our study for more accurate modeling of the BLE discovery process. Our work focuses on developing an analytical model and carrying out intensive simulations to investigate discovery probability and quantitative examination of the influence of parameter settings on the discovery latency and the energy performance metric of the discovery process.",

Although event-based processing system has been widely used in various applications, however, consistency of event processing is still an open issue need further exploration. The inconsistency problem produces inaccurate detection result and corrupts the system correctness. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach for event modeling and detection model transformation with a semantic calculus system. Particularly, we first propose a complex event semantic model, OntoEvent, and define several key operators and properties to describe the logic, temporal and attribute relations in complex events. Second, we propose the concept of event constraint and elaborate the occurrence, temporal, and attribute functions to formalize the semantic implications in OntoEvent model. On that basis, we present the extraction rules and establish a calculus mechanism for constraints based on axioms. With these works, an automata-based detection model, named OntoCEP (Ontology-based Complex Event Detection), and a pipelined procedure for the assembly from constraints to OntoCEP model is proposed. The procedure is composed of several sequential phases and the consistency in each assembly phase is proved. Therefore, we establish a semantic-consistent mapping mechanism from event to detection model in the form of constraints. Experiments and evaluations prove that our approach ensure the consistency with event and detection models. Besides, our detection model consumes less computational resources and outperforms other selected benchmarked models in terms of computational efficiency and processing capability.",

abstract = "The needs for efficient and scalable community health awareness model become a crucial issue in today’s health care applications. Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay.",

As such they become part of everyday life and drive applications as diverse as medical monitoring, smart homes, smart environment, and smart factories, to name but a few. To acquire data, individual sensors interact with the physical environment by sensing physical phenomena in proximity. The wireless network connectivity is leveraged to collect the raw data or pre-processed events, and to disseminate code, queries or commands. Actuating capabilities facilitate instant interactions with the environment or application processes. Experience on how to operate large scale heterogeneous WSNs in (critical) real-world applications is still scarce, and operational considerations are often an afterthought to WSN deployment. A principled look into the metrics, i.e., a standard or best practice of measurement of the ‘vital’ parameters in WSNs is still missing. In this article, we contribute a survey on the most important metrics to characterize the performance of WSNs. We define an abstract system model for WSNs, take a look on what the WSN community considers ‘metrics that matter’, and categorize the metrics into scopes of relevance. We discuss the properties of the metrics as well as practical aspects on how to obtain and process them. Our survey can serve as a ‘manual’ for implementors and operators of WSNs in the IoT.",

abstract = "Today, healthcare providers are experiencing explosive growth in data. Although the dramatic increase in the use of medical imaging technologies has been a major contributor to healthcare data growth in the past decade, more recently the rising adoption of sensing devices, enabling people to collect health-related data independently at any time or place is leading to a torrent of sensor data. The scale and richness of the sensor data currently being collected and analysed is rapidly growing. The key challenges that we will be facing are how to effectively manage and make use of this abundance of easily generated and diverse health data. This paper explores the potential for sensors use in healthcare data acquisition and presents the next evolution in the on-going development of Wiki-Health, a big data service platform, designed to address the larger problem of explosive growth in healthcare information by providing a unified solution for collecting, storing, tagging, retrieving, searching and analysing personal health sensor data. Additionally, the platform is designed to allow users to reuse and remix data, along with analysis results and analysis models, to make health-related knowledge discovery more available to individual users–including health professionals, patients or even individuals who desire to maintain an optimum level of personal health–on a massive scale. To tackle the challenge of efficiently managing the high volume and diversity of big data, Wiki-Health introduces a hybrid data storage model capable of storing structured, semi-structured and unstructured sensor data and sensor metadata separately. The design of such a hybrid model allows Wiki-Health to potentially handle heterogeneous formats of sensor data. In addition to its data management capabilities, we envision the potential for Wiki-Health as a system that also enables health sensor data monitoring and analysis, not only as a method of tracking existing health conditions but also as a means of encouraging a more pro-active approach to healthcare through early detection. To tackle the scalability and performance challenges of real-time analysis, the Analysis Tasks Allocation Scheme proposed in the research aids the management of data analysis tasks on a large scale and utilises the elastic nature of cloud infrastructure by considering the aspects of performance and cost. To evaluate the proposed Wiki-Health approach, we have developed an ECG-based health monitoring service on top of the Wiki-Health platform. The positive performance of the approach is supported by the results obtained in our experimental trials and shows significant potential for real-world applications.",

abstract = "The increasing development of civilization is one of the important issues exacerbating urban problems, such as pollution, poor sustainability, and weak security. The creation of ubiquitous cities (u-city), with intelligent convergence systems, is a solution to overcoming these problems. The u-city is at a more advanced level than a smart city, and building a smart city is a step toward the u-city. Thus, this study develops an effective framework to determine the required platform toward establishing a u-city by explores the main components of a smart city, such as citizens, environments, and key infrastructures, and the criteria to measure each component. The interaction between the components and their criteria, are specified using the Analytical Network Process (ANP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods Finally, according to the weights obtained, a ubiquitous coefficient for a city is proposed. In this study, the u-coefficients for Tehran, Iran and Seoul, South Korea are obtained (45% and 92%, respectively), which verify the accuracy of the suggested framework for determining ubiquitous conditions of cities. Tehran has the highest weights in the basic components (citizens and governments) and it needs to invest in building a ubiquitous infrastructure in transportation, healthcare, and the economy.",

abstract = "Many older patients and patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) do not respect medication prescriptions. Non-adherence is caused by several factors among which three play an important role: Treatment complexity, cognitive decline, and patient-provider communication. This article presents an ongoing multidisciplinary project, the CONSIGNELA project, which adopts a patient-centered approach for improving medication adherence in these patients. The first objective of the project is to identify the best way to communicate medication prescriptions with tablets and touch-screen devices. The second objective is to improve medication adherence by creating a collaborative application (app) designed both for older and PD patients and for healthcare professionals in charge of them. Two solutions are combined: A cognitive and a technological solutions. The cognitive solution consists in studying in real time older and PD patients while consulting and executing prescriptions presented in different formats to select the most efficient one. The technological solution aims to improve collaboration between health professionals and patients by developing System of Systems (SoS). The research model used in the project includes three phases. Only the results of phase 1 are presented in the article. A research app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-R was programmed to analyze patient cognitive processes while consulting a prescription on a tablet. A pilot study was carried out with young adults to test it. It confirmed a facilitating effect of table format. In parallel, the prototype of a second app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-P, for patients and healthcare providers was developed. It is based on an SoS architecture connecting a virtual pillbox, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and a knowledge platform. The virtual pillbox is used by patients and providers to improve mutual understanding of medication prescriptions. The MAS provides agents that extract and analyze indicators, actions and information resulting from the interaction between patients and virtual pillboxes. All the information is capitalized and stored in the knowledge platform. Providers can receive charts and dashboards showing information about the following of the medication regimen, for instance, if patients are following it correctly or not.",

abstract = "There has been a shift in research towards the convergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms motivated by the need for IoT applications to leverage the unique characteristics of the cloud. IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes “things” to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated against four established service composition algorithms in multiple cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, and COM2), with the results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.",

It is in the interest of many scenarios due to its low cost, ease of deployment and good performance in indoor settings. However, the identification of a large scale of tags that surround RFID readers within the limited time raises a big challenge for RFID-based tracking. To solve this problem, we propose two core design components, RFID MAC and a range-free tracking algorithm. In MAC layer, we develop two protocols, one is Framed Slotted Aloha (random access) and the other is Tree-Walking (polling), as the underlying sensing component. We also develop a basic tracking on a central node which collects tag identification information from all RFID readers. Our system is implemented in the Qualnet tool, and we run numerous experiments to study performance under different parameter settings. These results validate the effectiveness of our indoor tracking solution using RFID.",

M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications represent one of the main pillars of the new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), and is making possible new opportunities for the eHealth business. Nevertheless, the large number of M2M protocols currently available hinders the election of a suitable solution that satisfies the requirements that can demand eHealth applications.
Objectives
In the first place, to develop a tool that provides a benchmarking analysis in order to objectively select among the most relevant M2M protocols for eHealth solutions. In the second place, to validate the tool with a particular use case: the respiratory rehabilitation.
Methods
A software tool, called Distributed Computing Framework (DFC), has been designed and developed to execute the benchmarking tests and facilitate the deployment in environments with a large number of machines, with independence of the protocol and performance metrics selected.
Results
DDS, MQTT, CoAP, JMS, AMQP and XMPP protocols were evaluated considering different specific performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, bandwidth consumption, latency and jitter. The results obtained allowed to validate a case of use: respiratory rehabilitation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in two scenarios with different types of requirement: Home-Based and Ambulatory.
Conclusions
The results of the benchmark comparison can guide eHealth developers in the choice of M2M technologies. In this regard, the framework presented is a simple and powerful tool for the deployment of benchmark tests under specific environments and conditions.",

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.",

Machine-to-machine communications (M2M) is one of the components of IoT which deals with communication of devices to device and device to the network aspects. LTE-A networks have emerged as one of the preferred underlying communication networks to support IoT or M2M traffic. However, the uplink packet scheduling to optimize the QoS (quality of service) of M2M traffic without affecting or least affecting the QoS of Human-to-human (H2H) traffic (traffic generated by regular users (also called as H2H users) such as smartphone traffic, Internet traffic, voice traffic, etc.) is one of the main challenges in LTE-A networks. As a solution, we propose an uplink packet scheduling mechanism, called as enhanced class based dynamic priority (E-CBDP) algorithm, which ensures the QoS of H2H traffic by giving it priority over M2M traffic but, optimizes the QoS of M2M traffic by pushing the scheduling of H2H traffic to their delay boundaries. Further, a dynamic M2M traffic control threshold is defined to enable the operator for proactive regulation of the huge M2M traffic to avoid network congestion as well as to minimise the impact on H2H traffic. We characterize the proposed scheduling algorithm via a mathematical analysis of metrics such as average length of the H2H queue, average length of the M2M queue, average waiting time of H2H packets, and average waiting time of M2M packets. We compare the performance of E-CBDP algorithm with some recent solutions in terms of average delay, percentage of packets dropped, aggregate throughput, fairness, and energy consumption. Simulation results show that E-CBDP algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in terms of packet drop rate and fairness while provides satisfactory performance in terms of delay, throughput, and energy consumption.",

A primary concern in HIEs is the need for explicit authorization of information exchange in an auditable manner. However, we find that existing approaches for authorization in health information systems exhibit several drawbacks in meeting the needs of HIE, with non-cryptographic approaches lacking a secure and reliable mechanism for access policy enforcement, while cryptographic approaches being too expensive, complex and limited in specifying policies. This paper aims to overcome these drawbacks by presenting a simple and efficient patient-centric authorization protocol for information sharing in cloud-based HIE systems. The proposed protocol is built using a novel trapdoor hash-based proxy signature scheme, and ensures that the authorization is authentic with respect to both providers and patients, and complies with the established access control policies. Features of the proposed protocol include auditability, non-interactive and on-demand operation, and specification and secure/reliable enforcement of flexible access control policies. A detailed security and performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol is provably secure against forgery under the discrete log assumption, and achieves the best overall performance compared to other well-known schemes in the literature.",

As a new application technology of the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent medical treatment has attracted the attention of both nations and industries through its promotion of medical informatisation, modernisation, and intelligentisation. Faced with a wide variety of intelligent medical terminals, consumers may be affected by various factors when making purchase decisions.
Purpose
To examine and evaluate the key influential factors (and their interrelationships) of consumer adoption behavior for improving and promoting intelligent medical terminals toward achieving set aspiration level in each dimension and criterion.
Method
A hybrid modified Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model was used for this study, based on three components: (1) the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique, to build an influential network relationship map (INRM) at both ‘dimensions’ and ‘criteria’ levels; (2) the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) method, to determine the interrelationships and influential weights among the criteria and identify the source-influential factors; and (3) the modified Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, to evaluate and improve for reducing the performance gaps to meet the consumers’ needs for continuous improvement and sustainable products-development. First, a consensus on the influential factors affecting consumers’ adoption of intelligent medical terminals was collected from experts’ opinion in practical experience. Next, the interrelationships and influential weights of DANP among dimensions/criteria based on the DEMATEL technique were determined. Finally, two intelligent medicine bottles (AdhereTech, A1 alternative; and Audio/Visual Alerting Pillbox, A2 alternative) were reviewed as the terminal devices to verify the accuracy of the MADM model and evaluate its performance on each criterion for improving the total certification gaps by systematics according to the modified VIKOR method based on an INRM.
Results
In this paper, the criteria and dimensions used to improve the evaluation framework are validated. The systematic evaluation in index system is constructed on the basis of five dimensions and corresponding ten criteria. Influential weights of all criteria ranges from 0.037 to 0.152, which shows the rank of criteria importance. The evaluative framework were validated synthetically and scientifically. INRM (influential network relation map) was obtained from experts’ opinion through DEMATEL technique shows complex interrelationship among factors. At the dimension level, the environmental dimension influences other dimensions the most, whereas the security dimension is most influenced by others. So the improvement order of environmental dimension is prior to security dimension. The newly constructed approach was still further validated by the results of the empirical case, where performance gap improvement strategies were analyzed for decision-makers. The modified VIKOR method was especially validated for solving real-world problems in intelligent medical terminal improvement processes. For this paper, A1 performs better than A2, however, promotion mix, brand factor, and market environment are shortcomings faced by both A1 and A2. In addition, A2 should be improved in the wireless network technology, and the objective contact with a high degree of gaps.
Conclusions
Based on the evaluation index system and the integrated model proposed here, decision-makers in enterprises can identify gaps when promoting intelligent medical terminals, from which they can get valuable advice to improve consumer adoption. Additionally, an INRM and the influential weights of DANP can be combined using the modified VIKOR method as integrated weightings to determine how to reduce gaps and provide the best improvement strategies for reaching set aspiration levels.",

New access control systems must rely on continuous authentication (CA) to provide higher security level. To achieve this, recent research has shown how biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) or electrocardiograms (ECGs), can be useful for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a new CA scheme that, contrarily to previous works in this area, considers ECG signals as continuous data streams. The data stream paradigm is suitable for this scenario since algorithms tailored for data streams can cope with continuous data of a theoretical infinite length and with a certain variability. The proposed ECG-based CA system is intended for real-time applications and is able to offer an accuracy up to 96%, with an almost perfect system performance (kappa statistic >80%).",

However, the reality is that increasingly people are moving to cities, which generates many challenges for the cities of tomorrow. In this context, the Smart Cityconcept emerges, where Information and Communication Technologies have a key role. This situation has revealed an important issue that needs to be addressed: the lack of an ubiquitous communication architecture able to deal with the expected requirements of a SC. To this end, a wide review of the existing communication frameworks and city services have been performed, which showed that existing proposals are classical fixed ad-hocsolutions for very specific problems with no resilience and common thread. By rethinking the nature of cities and considering them as living organisms, it is possible to relate the nervous systems with the communication architecture of a city. Therefore, this work proposes a novel communication architecture, ubiquitous and resilient, inspired in the human nervous system by the definition of Smart Gateways, able to satisfy the needs of a real SCand adaptable to the growing and specific requirements of every single city. Additionally, the research also includes the simulation of the communication channel with different technologies.",

But differences are at the possibilities of modern ergonomics, movement of science and technical possibilities. The options of using a mobile applications, Internet of Things, data gathering and their real time evaluation and their sharing. We present those solutions that combine traditional knowledge and modern technologies. The results are innovative and advanced ergonomic tools based on Industry 4.0 concept. Electronic tools are a new direction in ergonomics. With the support of mobile applications we see a way to create healthy conditions at work for production and also non-production workers, assembly and logistics. At the beginning of 20-th century, majority of us had no idea what the ergonomics is, how many risks occur during our job that they are connected with the health of employees and have not known that special methods and tools for their identification, analysis, evaluation and identification are developed. With the growing development of society we got to stadium when, luckily, majority of companies – employers even know the meaning of ergonomics or work risks, about risks at their workplaces and establish their evaluation and try to eliminate them. We have many methods and tools of modern ergonomics which enable us to realize analysis and optimization of employee's work to their benefit. Considering experience we can surely claim that we know the main problem of these days. It is requisite to realize ergonomic evaluation perfectly, extensively and mainly quickly. Slowness of some solutions discourages managers and directors and makes effective improving of work conditions impossible. The idea of mobile application developing which works as a screening tool came with demands from big companies that have dozens of workplaces and cannot identify work risks by themselves. Ceit ERgonomics Analysis Application, which is described in article, is output of our own research and development. It is a mobile application developed in CEIT Company in collaboration with the University of Žilina and Slovak ergonomic association. It is a screening evaluation of space conditions and work positions of workers at potentially risky workplaces. It is developed at the base of legislation and technical norms, at our own platform, with the support of virtual and augmented reality. The main goal of evaluation by the CERAA usage is to find out if the workplace is risky from the ergonomic view. It is an innovative way of applied augmented reality tools during the ergonomic evaluation of chosen workplaces. Nowadays, the new submodules are being developed. They will identify risks at administrative workplaces, submodule which will evaluate working with loads and other that will evaluate repetitive operations. CERAA is used in several industrial companies in Slovakia and Czech Republic from the second half of 2016.",

abstract = "The growing gap between users and the big data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of big data application and data science leads toward a new paradigm of human behavior, where various smart devices integrate with each other and establish a relationship. However, majority of the systems are either memoryless or computational inefficient, which are unable to define or predict human behavior. Therefore, keeping in view the aforementioned needs, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently analyze a stream of big data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that integrates social network with the technical network. We derive a novel notion of ‘Socio-Cyber Network’, where a friendship is made based on the geo-location information of the user, where trust index is used based on graphs theory. The proposed graph theory provides a better understanding of extraction knowledge from the data and finding relationship between different users. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce. MapReduce for cyber-physical system (CPS) is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently process a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using Spark GraphX tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes to generate and process graphs with near real-time. Moreover, the system is evaluated in terms of efficiency by considering the system throughput and processing time. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient.",

Since the data communication and services occur on a variety of devices, which not only include traditional computing environments and mobile devices such as smartphones, but also household appliances, embedded devices, and sensor nodes, the security requirements are becoming increasingly important at this point in time. Already, in the case of mobile applications, security has emerged as a new issue, as the dissemination and use of mobile applications have been rapidly expanding. This software, including IoT services and mobile applications, is continuously exposed to malicious attacks by hackers, because it exchanges data in the open Internet environment. The security weaknesses of this software are the direct cause of software breaches causing serious economic loss. In recent years, the awareness that developing secure software is intrinsically the most effective way to eliminate the software vulnerability, rather than strengthening the security system of the external environment, has increased. Therefore, methodology based on the use of secure coding rules and checking tools is attracting attention to prevent software breaches in the coding stage to eliminate the above vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a compiler and a virtual machine with secure software concepts for developing secure and trustworthy services for IoT environments. By using a compiler and virtual machine, we approach the problem in two stages: a prevention stage, in which the secure compiler removes the security weaknesses from the source code during the application development phase, and a monitoring stage, in which the secure virtual machine monitors abnormal behavior such as buffer overflow attacks or untrusted input data handling while applications are running.",

This study presents an overview of the literature on residential DR systems, load-scheduling techniques, and the latest ICT that supports residential DR applications. Furthermore, challenges are highlighted and analyzed, which are likely to become relevant research topics with regard to the residential DR of smart grid. The literature review shows that most DR schemes suffer from an externality problem that involves the effect of high-level customer consumption on the price rates of other customers, especially during peak period.

In this paper, we investigate the PM2.5 footprint of household energy consumption in Beijing based on input–output analysis. An inventory of primary and secondary household energy consumption is developed to quantify the direct PM2.5 emissions. The household PM2.5 footprint is then traced through goods or services that ultimately consumed by households to unveil the indirect PM2.5 emissions triggered by economic activities. PM2.5 fingerprint is also proposed to describe the characteristic of household PM2.5 footprint. Results show that PM2.5 footprint of Beijing households in 2010 is 7831.36 kt, of which 92.61% is contributed by urban households. The source of direct PM2.5 emissions in urban area is diversified, which is composed of coal (42.07%), heat and electricity (32.83%), gasoline (21.29%), natural gas (3.04%) and liquefied petroleum gas (0.77%), while in rural area, coal (98.09%) plays a dominant role. The indirect PM2.5 accounts for 99.96% of the total footprint in urban area, about one third of which is contributed by sectors of “Food Processing and Production”, “Healthcare and Social Security”, and “Farming, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Fishery”. The disparity between urban and rural households PM2.5 footprints is further evaluated with income levels. The PM2.5 footprint from living expenditures of urban households is found to be nearly twice as much as that of rural households. Such inventory of PM2.5 footprint and examination of drivers for PM2.5 emissions may be essential for urban pollution mitigation policy.",

On the other side, evaluation of ambient services is often a laborious task. This work presents an approach that simplifies the evaluation by making use of two frameworks from robotics to perform tests in simulated smart environments. A method based on the language as action principle is used to extract realistic behavior of people living in real-world smart environments.

abstract = "The popularity of wireless sensor networks has grown rapidly in recent years, with new directions including healthcare monitoring and disaster response. This increased use in mobile applications has naturally led to new challenges to the design of sensor protocols, especially in the media access control (MAC) sublayer. In order to design a MAC protocol which takes mobility awareness into account, understanding how mobility can be described by mobility models is crucial. Moreover, for applications that transform between static, periodic-mobile, random-mobile, or variable number of nodes, flexibility in design is a key consideration. Therefore, in this paper mobility pattern, mobility models and mobility estimation algorithms for wireless sensor networks are discussed. The state of the art of medium access control protocols with mobility-handling capabilities is overviewed and a comparative study of the most well-known mobility aware MAC protocols is given. Finally, future research directions for mobility-aware MAC protocols are presented. We believe this paper will aid researchers by serving as a reference to orient future research in this area.",

Although the general requirements of 5G systems are progressively taking shape, the technological issues raised by such a vision are still partially unclear. Nonetheless, general consensus has been reached upon some specific challenges, such as the need for 5G wireless access networks to support massive access by MTDs, as a consequence of the proliferation of M2M services. In this paper, we describe the main challenges raised by the M2M vision, focusing in particular on the problems related to the support of massive MTD access in current cellular communication systems. Then we analyze the most common approaches proposed in the literature to enable the coexistence of conventional and M2M services in the current and next generation of cellular wireless systems.

The development of the Virtual Patient will change conventional medicine, which has been based upon experience and expectation, into “predictive medicine” that will have the capacity to develop solutions based upon prior understanding of the dynamic mechanisms and the quantitative logic of human physiology. Drug discovery, medical and welfare apparatus, and clinical trials in silico will improve the development of products with higher efficiency, reliability and safety while reducing cost. They will also impact upon knowledge-intensive industries. Such program aims at playing a key role in this new area, by sharing and generating solutions as well as human resources contributing to establishment of “in silico medicine” as a basis of the predictive medicine within an international framework. In the long-term, computational physiological models will be refined, linked and validated until they are capable of providing essential predictions to clinicians when healthcare decisions need to be made. As the amount of data reinforcing the models grows, predictions will become more and more patient-centred, with models migrating from statistical, average models to physiological and mechanistic models informed by the unique characteristics of the patient. Systems Patientomics will propose new ways of combining this rich patient information space in a highly visual, coherent, meaningful way and of generating new clinical information by blending and fusing existing information, ultimately creating a “Patient Avatar” capable of supporting the medical professional by producing new clinical knowledge emerging from the integration of patient- and population-specific information.

abstract = "In order to meet the growing demands for high-throughput, cost-effective, and energy efficient solution for the emerging device-to-device (D2D) based Internet of Things (IoT) communication, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and sharing based protocols have been proposed. However, due to the temporal and spatial transience of spectrum utilization by licensed incumbents, optimal spectrum resource management becomes critical for: (a) effective D2D communication without disrupting the licensed incumbents, and (b) sustained operation in a multi-hop mesh environment due to the inherent energy constraint of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose SpEED-IoT: Spectrum aware Energy- Efficient multi-hop multi-channel routing scheme for D2D communication in IoT mesh network. We assume the knowledge of a radio environment map (REM) obtained through dedicated spectrum sensors that capture the spatio-temporal spectrum usage. We exploit such REMs to propose a multi-hop routing scheme that finds the: (a) best route, (b) best available channels at each hop along the route, and (c) optimal transmission power for each hop. SpEED-IoT also employs an evolutionary game theoretic route allocation model to sustain parallel D2D communication. SpEED-IoT ensures: (i) licensed incumbent protection, (ii) IoT device energy preservation, (iii) effective end-to-end data rate optimization, and (iv) fast convergence and fair route assignment among interfering D2D communications. Through simulation-driven GENI-based IoT testbed, we evaluate SpEED-IoT’s performance in terms of: (a) ensuring connectivity and reachability among the IoT devices under varying spectrum usage conditions, (b) data rate optimization of the assigned routes and the overall IoT network, (c) effectiveness in licensed incumbent protection, and (d) degree of fairness while assigning routes to multiple interfering devices.",

In addition, Big Data analytics requires new and sophisticated algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques to process data in real-time with high accuracy and efficiency. However, recently, research incorporated various deep learning techniques with hybrid learning and training mechanisms of processing data with high speed. Most of these techniques are specific to scenarios and based on vector space thus, shows poor performance in generic scenarios and learning features in big data. In addition, one of the reason of such failure is high involvement of humans to design sophisticated and optimized algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques. In this article, we bring forward an approach of comparing various deep learning techniques for processing huge amount of data with different number of neurons and hidden layers. The comparative study shows that deep learning techniques can be built by introducing a number of methods in combination with supervised and unsupervised training techniques.",

Some of these techniques can be applied to other industries, such as jet engine maintenance, and can be expanded to others with implications for robust decision analysis.

By controlling the process parameters in synthesizing of CuO nanostructures, programming the limit of detection has been obtained up to 100ppb H2S for CuO-SWCNT nanostructures at room temperature. Gas sensing evaluation of nanomaterials indicates the role of surface to volume ratio on the performance of the sensors.

The CuO-SWCNT nanomaterials has been immobilized on top-side of commercial 13.56MHz radio frequency identification (RFID) tag by drop-casting to produce tag sensors.

abstract = "Defects and errors in new or recently completed construction work continually pervade the industry. Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.",

In this paper, an effective cloud computing architecture is proposed which predicts H1N1 infected patients and provides preventions to control infection rate. It consists of four processing components along with secure cloud storage medical database. The random decision tree is used to initially assess the infection in any patient depending on his/her symptoms. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to present the state of the outbreak. The proposed architecture is tested on synthetic data generated for two million users. The system provided 94% accuracy for the classification and around 81% of the resource utilization on Amazon EC2 cloud. The key point of the paper is the use of SNA graphs to calculate role of an infected user in spreading the outbreak known as Outbreak Role Index (ORI).

Not only have more providers and service offerings crowded the space, but also cloud infrastructure that was traditionally limited to single provider data centers is now evolving. In this paper, we firstly discuss the changing cloud infrastructure and consider the use of infrastructure from multiple providers and the benefit of decentralising computing away from data centers. These trends have resulted in the need for a variety of new computing architectures that will be offered by future cloud infrastructure. These architectures are anticipated to impact areas, such as connecting people and devices, data-intensive computing, the service space and self-learning systems. Finally, we lay out a roadmap of challenges that will need to be addressed for realising the potential of next generation cloud systems.",

However, DR can be eased through timely treatment and periodical screening. In this paper, we proposes an automatic diabetic retinopathy diagnostic system to help patients know about their retinal conditions. We design a portable ophthalmoscope, which is composed of a retinal lens, a smartphone and a frame between them to help patients take fundus images anywhere and anytime. Then the images are transmitted to be analyzed, including localization of optic disk and macular, vessel segmentation, detection of lesions, and grading of DR. We use a multi-scale line operator to improve accuracy in segmenting small-scale vessels, a binary mask and image restoration to reduce the effect of the existence of the vessels on optic disk localization. After the analysis, the fundus image are then graded as normal, mild Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), moderate NPDR or severe NPDR. The grading process uses region segmentation to improve the efficiency. The final grading results are tested based on the fundus images provided by the hospitals. We evaluate our system through comparing our grading result with those graded by experts, which comes out with an overall accuracy of up to 85%.",

Thus, there is a need for sophisticated fine-grained access control mechanisms to cater these access demands and thereby experience the full potential of e-health systems. In order to realize a flexible access control scheme, integrating access delegation is of paramount importance. However, access delegation has to be enforced in a controlled manner so that it will not jeopardize the security of the system. In this paper, we addressed this issue through proposing an attribute based access control scheme integrated with controlled access delegation capabilities. We demonstrate how the proposed scheme could function by considering a health information sharing scenario which constitutes a collaborative environment. The proposed scheme capable of provisioning multi-level access delegation with each delegating user having the capability of controlling further delegations by the delegatee. In addition, the scheme is also integrated with a mechanism to limit the total number of delegations allowable for a given attribute to accommodate for inappropriate user behaviors. Thus, users can claim access to resources by providing a proof that they possess attribute sets (attributes may or may not be delegated) that satisfy the relevant attribute based access policies which govern the access to the shared resources. The proposed scheme is also equipped with on-demand attribute revocation mechanism along with preventing attacks via attribute collusion. Furthermore, we have shown that the proposed access control scheme is secure and also exhibits superior delegation capabilities compared to the existing attribute based schemes coupled with access delegation capabilities.",

It represents an urban model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will present in this paper.",

Among the layered materials, mica is a well-known phyllosilicate mineral that can have a remarkable impact on flexible electronics. We confine ourselves to the validity of vdWE of functional oxides on muscovite mica throughout this treatise.

Yet there are many technical and commercial challenges which question the future of peer-assisted solutions in industrial settings. This includes among others unreliability of peer-to-peer networks, the lack of incentives for peers’ participation, and copyright issues. In this paper, we carefully review and systematize this ongoing debate around the future of peer-assisted networks and propose a novel taxonomy to characterize the research and industrial efforts in the area. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the last decade in the peer-assisted content delivery research and devise a novel taxonomy to characterize the identified challenges and the respective proposed solutions in the literature. Our survey includes a thorough review of the three very large scale feasibility studies conducted for BBC iPlayer, MSN Video and Conviva, five large commercial peer-assisted CDNs - Kankan, LiveSky, Akamai NetSession, Spotify, Tudou - and a vast scope of technical papers. We focus both on technical challenges in deploying peer-assisted solutions and also on non-technical challenges caused due to heterogeneity in user access patterns and distribution of resources among users as well as commercial feasibility related challenges attributed to the necessity of accounting for the interests and incentives of Internet Service Providers, End-Users and Content Providers. The results of our study suggest that many of technical challenges for implementing peer-assisted content delivery networks on an industrial scale have been already addressed in the literature, whereas a problem of finding economically viable solutions to incentivize participation in peer-assisted schemes remains an open issue to a large extent. Furthermore, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable expansion of conventional CDNs to a broader network of connected devices through machine to machine communication.",

Identifying application areas, design issues and IS research techniques will demonstrate models, issues, approaches and gaps to inform future research. A comprehensive analysis of the literature from this viewpoint is thus valuable, both for theoretical progression and for guiding real-world innovative system developments. Drawing from key IS and healthcare multidisciplinary journals we analyse recent (2010–2016) articles concerning M-health application developments and their associated design or development issues, with particular focus on the use of contemporary research methods. Our analysis suggests that M-health is an emerging field to which, although underused, contemporary approaches such as design science research are particularly appropriate. We identify eight application categories, eleven design issues (security, privacy, literacy, accessibility, acceptability, reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, knowledge sharing and flexibility) as well as the stakeholders and development techniques involved. This goes beyond previous frameworks, and theoretically integrates the central role of IS design within the sub-field.",

However, since sensor nodes are battery powered, communication protocols and applications for these networks must be carefully designed in order to limit the power consumption. In this work, a new MAC protocol able to significantly reduce the power consumption and compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, is designed and validated. The defined protocol is based on an efficient setting of the node’s duty cycle as a function of the transmission times of the neighbor nodes. In a duty cycle period, each node wakes up once to transmit and N times to receive, where N is the number of neighbors, while it remains in sleep mode for the rest of the time. The defined protocol has been validated through both an analytical and a simulative approach. By using the first approach, the proposed solution is compared with another energy-efficient protocol, namely AS-MAC; then, the differences between the simulated scenario and the analytical one are analyzed. By using the second approach (through Omnet++ simulator), we carried out a performance comparison between our protocol and the current MAC protocol compliant with the ZigBee standard. All the results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which has proved to be flexible and efficient, since it is able to provide high energy savings at different date rate, without a negative impact on the packets delivery.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.",

abstract = "In modern medical systems huge amount of text, words, images and videos are produced and stored in ad hoc databases. Medical community needs to extract precise information from that large amount of data. Currently ICT approaches do not provide a methodology for content-based medical images retrieval and classification. On the other hand, from the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, the ICT medical data can be produced by several devices. Produced data complies with all Big Data features and constraints. The IoT guidelines put at the center of the system a new smart software to manage and transform Big Data in a new understanding form. This paper describes a text based indexing system for mammographic images retrieval and classification. The system deals with text (structured reports) and images (mammograms) mining and classification in a typical Department of Radiology. DICOM structured reports, containing free text for medical diagnosis, have been analyzed and labeled in order to classify the corresponding mammographic images. Information Retrieval process is based on some text manipulation techniques, such as light semantic analysis, stop-word removing, and light medical natural language processing. The system includes also a Search Engine module, based on a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of Specificity and Sensibility. Two more indexes have been computed in order to assess the system robustness: the Az (Area under ROC Curve) index and the σAz (Az standard error) index. The dataset is composed of healthy and pathological DICOM structured reports. Two use case scenarios are presented and described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO2, O2, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives.",

A caregiver must assess the well being of residents and report to the medical staff if there is something unusual with a resident.

In this paper, we explore three visualization metaphors aiming at providing caregivers with an individualized overview of the activities carried out by residents in a given time frame. We postulate that this overview is sufficient to distinguish between normal and abnormal periods of time when visually compared in groups. We also present two automated approaches, data driven and knowledge driven respectively, to detect abnormalities. The visualization and the automated approaches are tested on a naturalistic dataset obtained from a long-term personalized sensing and annotation campaign in a residence for geriatric patients. Data is of two types, obtained from IoT infrastructure and wearables and from manual annotations made by the staff. Both approaches were empirically evaluated and validated in the paper. A side product of this research is a large repository of cleansed data from the sensing and annotation campaign for 45 older adults over a period of 39 months.",

abstract = "Over the past few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to transform urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services that make smart cities “smart” are curated by using data streams of smart cities i.e., inhabitants’ location information, digital engagement, transportation, environment and local government data. Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable attempts have been made to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants’ data. However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have their own reservations — service provider trust, reliability of the sensed data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning in smart cities, namely the ‘Smart Secure Service Provisioning’ (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition, transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The proposed framework ensures inhabitants’ privacy, and also guarantees integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols by an automated security verification tool called Scyther.",

abstract = "With the rapid development of Cloud Computing, Big Data, Social Networks, and the Internet of Things, typical service optimization problems (SOPs) such as service selection, service composition and service resource scheduling in the service computing field have become more and more complicated due to the constant enrichment and dynamic aggregation of large number of services, as well as the unceasing variation of user requirements. Meanwhile, with the long-term development and evolution of business in many application domains, some service domain features (such as priori, correlation and similarity) are usually formed, which have strong influences on solving SOPs. Unfortunately, the existing research efforts on SOPs primarily concentrate on designing general algorithms for specific problems without considering the service domain features. This often leads to undesirable results of SOPs. Therefore, how to design a paradigm of service domain-oriented optimization algorithms with service domain features becomes a challenge for providing optimization strategies and algorithms to solve SOPs effectively. By considering the influences of service domain features on solving SOPs, this paper proposes a set of service domain-oriented artificial bee colony algorithms (S-ABC) based on the optimization mechanism of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method. Furthermore, by configuring the items and parameters of the S-ABC paradigm in detail, optimization algorithms for particular SOPs (e.g., service selection and composition) could be derived. In this paper, the superiority of our proposed S-ABC is verified through solving concurrent service selection and service composition problem. By exploiting the artificial bee colony algorithms for the optimization problems in service domains, this work makes novel contributions for solving SOPs, as well as extends the theory of the swarm intelligence optimization.",

abstract = "Experimental extraction of the electron trap parameters which are associated with charge trapping into gate insulators under the positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) is proposed and demonstrated for the first time in amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistors. This was done by combining the PBTS/recovery time-evolution of the experimentally decomposed threshold voltage shift (ΔVT) and the technology computer-aided design (TCAD)-based charge trapping simulation. The extracted parameters were the trap density (NOT) = 2.6×1018 cm−3, the trap energy level (ΔET) = 0.6 eV, and the capture cross section (σ0) = 3 × 10−19 cm2. Furthermore, based on the established TCAD framework, the relationship between the electron trap parameters and the activation energy (Ea) is comprehensively investigated. It is found that Ea increases with an increase in σ0, whereas Ea is independent of NOT. In addition, as ΔET increases, Ea decreases in the electron trapping-dominant regime (low ΔET) and increases again in the Poole–Frenkel (PF) emission/hopping-dominant regime (high ΔET). Moreover, our results suggest that the cross-over ΔET point originates from the complicated temperature-dependent competition between the capture rate and the emission rate. The PBTS bias dependence of the relationship between Ea and ΔET suggests that the electric field dependence of the PF emission-based electron hopping is stronger than that of the thermionic field emission-based electron trapping.",

This vision faces many challenges in terms of integrating technologies, especially RFID-sensor networks (RSNs). In this paper, we introduce a framework for node deployment and delay-tolerance in RSNs under the IoT paradigm. Our framework is comprised of two components. The first is SIWR, a novel Smart Integrated WSNs and RFIDs architecture that classifies nodes into light nodes and super integrated nodes. SIWR employs an optimal linear programming formulation to cost-efficiently place integrated RFID readers. However, integrated IoT architectures face significant connectivity challenges. IoT settings assume no guaranteed contemporaneous end-to-end path between node pairs. To this end, in the second part of our framework, we introduce DIRSN, an optimized delay-tolerant approach for integrated RFID-sensor networks. This is a novel scheme for data routing and courier nodes’ selection in RSNs. DIRSN’s formulation minimizes delay across the network without violating the main dense-deployment and load-balancing requirements. In addition, DIRSN builds on SIWR’s novel architecture to locate the best set of couriers that promise to provide connectivity. Our combined approach is compared to three types of RSN integration architectures and the results show that our architecture and courier selection approaches perform substantially better than other architectures in terms of minimizing delay, cost, packet loss, and in handling extensive traffic demands.",

abstract = "The growth of cities in the 21st century has put more pressure on resources and conditions of urban life. There are several reasons why the health-care industry is the focus of this investigation. For instance, in the UK various studies point to the lack of failure of basic quality control procedures and misalignment between customer needs and provider services and duplication of logistics practices. The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing.",

However, traditional data storage techniques and algorithms are not applicable to process the huge amount of climate data. This paper presents a scalable data processing framework with a novel change detection algorithm. The large volume of climate data is stored on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce algorithm is applied to calculate the seasonal average of climate parameters. Spatial autocorrelation based climate change detection algorithm is proposed in this paper to monitor the changes in the seasonal climate. The proposed climate change detection algorithm is compared with various existing approaches such as pruned exact linear time method, binary segmentation method, and segment neighborhood method.",

abstract = "A smart home is considered as a new environment that can apply the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT). For that reason, the realization of the smart home requires the seamless integration among humans, physical objects, and user interactions. However, this accomplishment is currently unrealistic and expensive, considering the need to construct different types of physical smart homes and the need to evaluate them through the various aspects of user experiences. Thus, virtual reality is widely used for the preliminary test and pre-evaluation. However, there is little work to systematically evaluate the user experiences such as usability, natural and intuitive interaction between human and physical objects, and usefulness. This paper proposes a hybrid reality-based user experience and evaluation of a context-aware smart home. The user experience is provided by the integration of egocentric virtual reality and exocentric augmented reality. Furthermore, to make a smart home environment more natural and realistic, a world-in-miniature (WIM) of the smart home has been constructed where various kinds of tangible and physical smart home activities are allowed for prototyping a number of appliances, sensors, and human-physical object interactions. To evaluate the proposed approach, both qualitative and quantitative experiments are performed and analyzed. The proposed approach aims to provide developers and end users or consumers a useful tool for understanding and experiencing the smart home environment. Prior to the development of a physical smart home environment, it is essential for developers and designers to validate smart home services regarding context and visual awareness. Furthermore, it must be used for consumers or future residents to evaluate the smart home such that developers provide more customer-oriented environment and capture related problems before constructing the home.",

However, detecting stress in real life with an unobtrusive wrist device is a challenging task. The objective of this study is to develop a method for stress detection that can accurately, continuously and unobtrusively monitor psychological stress in real life. First, we explore the problem of stress detection using machine learning and signal processing techniques in laboratory conditions, and then we apply the extracted laboratory knowledge to real-life data. We propose a novel context-based stress-detection method. The method consists of three machine-learning components: a laboratory stress detector that is trained on laboratory data and detects short-term stress every 2min; an activity recognizer that continuously recognizes the user’s activity and thus provides context information; and a context-based stress detector that uses the outputs of the laboratory stress detector, activity recognizer and other contexts, in order to provide the final decision on 20-min intervals. Experiments on 55days of real-life data showed that the method detects (recalls) 70% of the stress events with a precision of 95%.",

Industry 4.0 and the corresponding industrial Internet of Things are about to generate new waves of process-related data, next to the abundance of event data already present in enterprise systems. However, organizations often fail to convert such data into strategic and tactical intelligence. This is due to the lack of dedicated technologies that are tailored to effectively manage the information on processes encoded in process models and process execution records. Process-related information is a core organizational asset which requires dedicated analytics to unlock its full potential. This paper proposes a framework for devising process querying methods, i.e., techniques for the (automated) management of repositories of designed and executed processes, as well as models that describe relationships between processes. The framework is composed of generic components that can be configured to create a range of process querying methods. The motivation for the framework stems from use cases in the field of Business Process Management. The design of the framework is informed by and validated via a systematic literature review. The framework structures the state of the art and points to gaps in existing research. Process querying methods need to address these gaps to better support strategic decision-making and provide the next generation of Business Intelligence platforms.",

Indeed, it is argued that the so-called ‘Smart Mobility’ transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed – will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.",

The aim of this survey paper is to provide an overview of different types of system and the associated transition process from mechatronics to CPS and cloud-based (IoT) systems. It will further consider the requirement that methodologies for CPS-design should be part of a multi-disciplinary development process within which designers should focus not only on the separate physical and computational components, but also on their integration and interaction. Challenges related to CPS-design are therefore considered in the paper from the perspectives of the physical processes, computation and integration respectively. Illustrative case studies are selected from different system levels starting with the description of the overlaying concept of Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). The analysis and evaluation of the specific properties of a sub-system using a condition monitoring system, important for the maintenance purposes, is then given for a wind turbine.",

abstract = "Ten years since the launch of version 1.0 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), technology has advanced to help merchants worldwide comply with the standard. Three approaches have become mainstream – tokenisation, point-to-point encryption (P2PE) and EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa). Both tokenisation and P2PE have proved to be powerful ways of securing data, while EMV has established an essential global standard for the interoperability of chip cards. However in one sector these advances in security are not effective; for many, the challenge of how to secure card payments made over the phone to a contact centre still exists. That's why one payment protection method, DTMF masking, has come to take a pivotal role in the protection of customer card data when taking payments made over the phone. It has been 10 years since the launch of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and many advances have been made to help merchants comply. But one area remains vulnerable. For many, the challenge of how to secure ‘card not present’ (CNP) payments made over the phone to a contact centre still exists. Allowing customers to provide sensitive information such as card numbers on calls that may be recorded presents serious challenges. That's why one payment protection method, DTMF masking, has come to take a pivotal role, as Tim Critchley of Semafone explains.",

However, it may be cost-prohibitive to replace exhausted batteries or even impossible in hostile environments. On the other hand, unlike other networks, WSNs are designed for specific applications which range from small-size healthcare surveillance systems to large-scale environmental monitoring. Thus, any WSN deployment has to satisfy a set of requirements that differs from one application to another. In this context, a host of research work has been conducted in order to propose a wide range of solutions to the energy-saving problem. This research covers several areas going from physical layer optimisation to network layer solutions. Therefore, it is not easy for the WSN designer to select the efficient solutions that should be considered in the design of application-specific WSN architecture. We present a top-down survey of the trade-offs between application requirements and lifetime extension that arise when designing wireless sensor networks. We first identify the main categories of applications and their specific requirements. Then we present a new classification of energy-conservation schemes found in the recent literature, followed by a systematic discussion as to how these schemes conflict with the specific requirements. Finally, we survey the techniques applied in WSNs to achieve trade-off between multiple requirements, such as multi-objective optimisation.",

Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.",

In addition, difficulties are discussed using a fishbone diagram. The SCAI model pays particular attention to the identification value, which tends to be ignored in other models. Opportunities and difficulties are structured as a map according to backcasting from a desired future M2M infrastructure. The backcasting approach is effective to untangle the intertwined difficulties. Using this opportunity-difficulty map, we can discuss and model M2M service businesses more clearly and strategically by recognizing the opportunities and the difficulties with stakeholders.

Disruptions in supply of critical materials can have serious negative repercussions for firms, consumers, and economies. One potential set of mitigation strategies for firms dealing with criticality issues is the implementation of circular economy principles in their supply chain, operations, and end-of-life management. This work conducts a literature review combined with case study analysis to examine how certain firms assess and monitor their vulnerability to critical material supply chain issues and provides specific business examples for integrating circularity strategies. Results indicate the potential for risk reduction that could be gained from implementation of these strategies; specifically recycling, for example, can provide an in-house source (for prompt or fabrication scrap) or at least domestic source (for post-consumer scrap) for critical materials; up to 24% for the case of indium usage in China. Just in time manufacturing techniques have the potential to both exacerbate supply issues (by encouraging low inventory or needed resources for manufacturing) and improve supply issues by introducing resiliency in the supply chain indicating that approach of firms in undertaking these strategies is important. Many cases reviewed show other quantifiable secondary benefits beyond risk reduction, such as economic savings, reduction in energy consumption, and improved corporate social responsibility via enhanced supply chain oversight.",

In essence, SIoT adapts a service-oriented architecture where heterogeneous IoT devices can offer or request autonomous services and collaborate on behalf of their owners. Operating Systems (OSs) are employed in IoT devices as they offer portability, threading support and access to development libraries; thus allowing easiness in IoT application development. Several OSs are available for IoT devices, but selecting an OS and hardware befitting for a particular IoT application is a critical task. In case of SIoT, the specific OS selection for hardware devices in various applications is even more challenging because of their collaborative nature. Existing surveys on OSs are mostly domain oriented and lack the discussion on hardware architectural features. As a consequence, it is infeasible for developers to choose best-suited OS for various hardware platforms which results in their underperformance in many application scenarios. This paper considers standard features of OS as well as hardware IoT platforms and provides an OS-to-hardware architectures features-mapping while exploring the unique requirements of SIoT applications. In doing so, resource-constrained IoT devices are particularly emphasized due to their memory constraints and power limitations. Further, a model OS architecture is proposed for devices in SIoT applications and associated open research challenges are identified. This research will benefit developers to best utilize IoT platform resources and to envisage an efficient OS for futuristic SIoT applications.",

This paradigm has opened the Service Cloud to a variety of wireless devices especially those with sensorial and actuating capabilities. Those pervasive networks contribute to build new context-aware applications that interpret the state of the physical world at real-time. However, traditional Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), which are widely used in the current Internet are unsuitable for such resource-constraint devices since they are too heavy. In this research paper, an internetworking approach is proposed in order to address that important issue. The main part of our proposal is the Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented (KASO) Middleware that has been designed for pervasive embedded networks. KASO Middleware implements a diversity of mechanisms, services and protocols which enable developers and business processing designers to deploy, expose, discover, compose, and orchestrate real-world services (i.e. services running on sensor/actuator devices). Moreover, KASO Middleware implements endpoints to offer those services to the Cloud in a REST manner. Our internetworking approach has been validated through a real healthcare telemonitoring system deployed in a sanatorium. The validation tests show that KASO Middleware successfully brings pervasive embedded networks to the Service Cloud.",

Elderly populations are more prone to diseases and need continuous monitoring of parameters to ensure good health. Wearable devices (WDs) can be helpful in the early detection and management of medical conditions. However, less is known about the use of currently available WDs among elderly populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the usefulness and actual use of wearable devices among the elderly population.
Methods
Our methodology was based on a systematic review and a survey questionnaire. In the systematic review, search was conducted in four databases PubMed, MDPI, Sage, and Scopus with search terms “wearable device” and “elderly”, “wearable sensor” and “elderly”. The inclusion criteria were the studies which described health-related wearable devices, its use as the outcome, conducted on a minimum of ten participants and published in the last five years. The survey was conducted on the MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) platform. The questionnaire was related to the use of technology, intention to use, security and privacy concerns, and willingness to pay.
Results
The review identified 4915 articles, of which, 31 studies eventually met the inclusion criteria. All studies reported positive impacts after assessing devices, despite certain drawbacks. The majority of the samples were males. The survey revealed responses from 233 individuals out of the 1100 participants of the course. The survey results were categorized into two age groups: 54.3% were elderly (>65 years) and 45.49% were non-elderly (≤65 years). Very few elderly people were currently using WD. More than 60% of elderly people were interested in the future use of wearable devices, and preferred future use to improve physical and mental activities. A majority of the respondents were female.
Conclusions
This study suggests awareness should be created among elderly populations regarding the use of WDs for the early detection and prevention of complications and emergencies. Elderly populations are more prone to benefits from using WDs. The review concluded that devices should be tested on elderly groups as well, considering sex equality, and on both healthy and sick participants for better insights. The survey determined the elderly as frequent users of technology, but lack of knowledge of WD and demonstrated female interest in the use of WD. In future research on WDs, it is suggested that clinical studies be conducted for longer durations, and standard protocols such as age and sex equality should be considered. Requirements from both users and physicians should be acknowledged for better cognizance of WDs.",

abstract = "Establishing a smart sensing system is desirable but challenging as the conventional devices require an external battery or power grid which cruelly limits its applications, especially in remote areas or at the condition of power supply with difficulty. Here, we report a smart self-powered sensing network based on a hybrid nanogenerator (NG) that can harvest wind energy and solar energy simultaneously or individually to serve as a sustainable power source. A transparent flag-like triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) plays a core role with both the output voltage and current positively proportional to the wind speed and the number of integrated units. By subtly designing, the bottom solar cell can absorb sunshine insusceptibly. The hybrid NG can not only be used as an active wind speed detection, but also be employed to construct a self-powered wireless temperature sensing system, further achieving multifunctional sensing. This work promotes the development of TENG-based renewable energy harvesting and puts forward the smart sensing network node that realizes multifunctional monitoring by scavenging environmental energy.",

This study aims to investigate whether PPPs access in a hospital environment violates patient privacy. If so, to what extent can we manage patient privacy while accessing PPPs in this environment? We investigated this question by analyzing questionnaire-based data from two Asian countries: Group A (China) and Group B (Pakistan). For data collection, we targeted those medical entities which were directly dealing with PPPs in their routine tasks. Results suggest that patient type directly influences the collection of PPPs: Group A (one-time = 1.9, follow-up = 1.06) and Group B (one-time = 2.0 and follow-up = 1.9). Both groups agreed that patients have the right to control their own PPPs. In both, doctors are the most trusted entity: for Group A, the Pearson Chi-Square with one degree of freedom is 1.414, p = 0.234, whereas for Group B, the Pearson Chi-Square with three degrees of freedom is 4.511, p = 0.11. Most of the Group A entities (92%) are familiar with unauthorized access of PPPs, while in Group B the level was only 35%. In Group B, only 35% of entities stated the purpose, specification and use limitations of PPPs. Doctors in both groups showed a high utilization of PPPs read authorization rights. This empirical evidence about PPPs usage in both countries will benefit health technology and improve policy on patient privacy.",

Wearable technology (wearables) is one approach that offers a viable means for ubiquitous, sustainable and scalable monitoring of the health of older adults in habitual free-living environments. Gait has been presented as a relevant (bio)marker in ageing and pathological studies, with objective assessment achievable by inertial-based wearables. Commercial wearables have struggled to provide accurate analytics and have been limited by non-clinically oriented gait outcomes. Moreover, some research-grade wearables also fail to provide transparent functionality due to limitations in proprietary software. Innovation within this field is often sporadic, with large heterogeneity of wearable types and algorithms for gait outcomes leading to a lack of pragmatic use. This review provides a summary of the recent literature on gait assessment through the use of wearables, focusing on the need for an algorithm fusion approach to measurement, culminating in the ability to better detect and classify falls. A brief presentation of wearables in one pathological group is presented, identifying appropriate work for researchers in other cohorts to utilise.

Nonetheless, so far market adoption has mostly been limited to the luxury segment and the more basic stand-alone technologies. Therefore, the main question driving this study is why Smart Home technology is so scarcely implemented despite its benefits to an aging population. From the literature we derive key market barriers in Smart Home value networks. We expand on these findings by means of a value network analysis of a Dutch smart home implementation case. In addition, we conducted 14 interviews that provide more insight into the value network of specific Smart Home services.

This paper proposes a cyber risk scoring system that considers a physician’s worst-case assessment of the potential of a medical device to impact a patient. The scoring system also relies on a security questionnaire based on the STRIDE model that helps generate a risk score for the medical device. Three test scenarios involving medical devices are used to demonstrate the application and utility of the risk scoring system.",

abstract = "Context
Software companies that develop their products on a basis of service-oriented architecture can expect various improvements as a result of choreography. Current choreography practices, however, are not yet used extensively in the embedded systems domain even though service-oriented architecture is increasingly used in this domain.
Objective
The objective of this study is to identify current features of the use of choreography in the embedded systems domain for practitioners and researchers by systematically analysing current developments in the scientific literature, strategies for choreography adaption, choreography specification and execution types, and implicit assumptions about choreography.
Method
To fulfil this objective, a systematic literature review of scientific publications that focus on the use of choreography in the embedded systems domain was carried out. After a systematic screening of 6823 publications, 48 were selected as primary studies and analysed using thematic synthesis.
Results
The main results of the study showed that there are differences in how choreography is used in embedded and non-embedded systems domain. In the embedded systems domain, it is used to capture the service interactions of a single organisation, while, for example, in the enterprise systems domain it captures the service interactions among multiple organisations. Additionally, the results indicate that the use of choreography can lead to improvements in system performance and that the languages that are used for choreography modelling in the embedded systems domain are insufficiently expressive to capture the complexities that are typical in this domain.
Conclusion
The selection of the key information resources and the identified gaps in the existing literature offer researchers a foundation for further investigations and contribute to the advancement of the use of choreography in the embedded systems domain. The study results facilitate the work of practitioners by allowing them to make informed decisions about the applicability of choreography in their organisations.",

A promising approach to addressing the challenges for data analytics in IoT is “edge cloud” that pushes various computing and data analysis capabilities to multiple edge clouds. MapReduce provides an efficient way to deal with a large amount of data. When performing data analysis, a challenge is to predict the performance of MapReduce jobs. In this paper, we propose and evaluate IoTDeM, which is an extended IoT Big Data-oriented model for predicting MapReduce performance in multiple edge clouds. IoTDeM is able to predict MapReduce jobs’ total execution time in a general implementation scenario with varying reduce amounts and cluster scales in Hadoop 2, rather than Hadoop 1. The extended model is based on historical job execution records and Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR) techniques to predict the execution time of each job. Through extracting more representative features to represent a job, the IoTDeM model selects a cluster scale as a crucial parameter to further extend LWLR model. In the environment of Hadoop 2 with Ceph as the storage system, the experiments verify IoTDeM can effectively predict the total execution time of MapReduce applications, with the average relative error of less than 10%.",

The aim is the first application of Singular Spectrum Analysis for computer processing of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). An illustration of the method advantages is the additional objective.
Method
The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a way of trend and seasonality extraction. SSA is suitable for short series with noises. It is also useful for the variability analysis. As well, it is simply programmable in a high-level programming language. Here Maple 18 was in use.
Results
Trends and the slowest oscillations were obtained within a case study. The error of SSA estimations turned out to be close to the exactness of measuring. However, these errors are in good agreement with the known descriptors of the short-time variability. The periods of the slowest oscillations were different for the systolic and the diastolic pressures. Seasonality was about six months and about two months respectively. We found the amplitude of the slowest oscillations of heart rate varies in time. This fact is in contrast to the blood pressure fluctuations, for which the amplitudes are stable.
Conclusions
SSA is a promising tool for HBPM data processing. It ensures smooth and readable trends as well as shows the long-term variability of series. This information can be usable for clinical decision-making and prognostics.",

abstract = "Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted attention for gas sensor fields due to their unique properties such as high surface to volume ratio and numerous active sites. In particular, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and MoS2 are one of the most promising materials for humidity sensor due to the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of rGO and dangling bonds at the edge site of MoS2. Herein, we present 2D rGO/2D MoS2 hybrid composites (MS-GOs) synthesized by hydrothermal method. rGO and MoS2 are mixed with different molar ratios and drop-casted on SiO2 substrate with Pt interdigitated electrode. At an optimized molar ratio of rGO/MoS2, the sensor device exhibits high sensitivity, good selectivity, rapid response and recovery, and good linearity for humidity sensing. The enhanced sensing properties are attributed to the p-n junction between rGO and MoS2. Our work provides an efficient way for realizing high-performance and fast responding humidity sensors utilizing 2D-2D heterojunction materials based chemoresistive humidity sensors for use in diverse applications.",

Timely loss-of-contact detection between devices in pervasive systems using mobile networks is an important aspect for both functionality and user experience. Traditional schemes where time-to-live is defined by the service provider are not adequate in mobile networks where communication failures are frequent. On the other hand, schemes using keep-alive messaging tend to increase the communication overhead, in particular if the time to detect a loss of contact needs to be short. We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application. Our solution was evaluated with usage data from a professional application built on the PalCom framework. The measurements show a 96 % decrease of the communication overhead while still maintaining the same system responsiveness.",

Mobile health or mHealth research has been growing exponentially in recent years. However, the research on mHealth has been ad-hoc and selective without a clear definition of the mHealth domain. Without a roadmap for research we may not realize the full potential of mHealth. In this paper, we present an ontological framework to define the mHealth domain and illuminate a roadmap.
Methods
We present an ontology of mHealth. The ontology is developed by systematically deconstructing the domain into its primary dimensions and elements. We map the extent research on mHealth in 2014 onto the ontology and highlight the bright, light, and blind/blank spots which represent the emphasis of mHealth research.
Findings
The emphases of mHealth research in 2014 are very uneven. There are a few bright spots and many light spots. The research predominantly focuses on individuals’ use of mobile devices and applications to capture or obtain health-related data mostly to improve quality of care through mobile intervention.
Conclusions
We argue that the emphases can be balanced in the roadmap for mHealth research. The ontological mapping plays an integral role in developing and maintaining the roadmap which can be updated periodically to continuously assess and guide mHealth research.",

Wearable, immersive augmented reality (WIAR) technology is one such technology whose introduction sparks these questions. Despite the proliferation of WIAR technology in safety-critical settings, few studies have examined its impacts on operator performance, decision processes and situation awareness in these settings. As a result, this paper considers research needs for evaluating WIAR technology in safety-critical systems. To illustrate the research needed, we consider the use case of a WIAR technology in marine navigation, and propose a research framework, summarizing research needs and identifying needed next steps.",

However, hardware constraints have limited their application, and real deployments have demonstrated that WSNs have difficulties in coping with complex communication tasks – such as mobility – in addition to application-related tasks. Mobility support in WSNs is crucial for a very high percentage of application scenarios and, most notably, for the Internet of Things. It is, thus, important to know the existing solutions for mobility in WSNs, identifying their main characteristics and limitations. With this in mind, we firstly present a survey of models for mobility support in WSNs. We then present the Network of Proxies (NoP) assisted mobility proposal, which relieves resource-constrained WSN nodes from the heavy procedures inherent to mobility management. The presented proposal was implemented and evaluated in a real platform, demonstrating not only its advantages over conventional solutions, but also its very good performance in the simultaneous handling of several mobile nodes, leading to high handoff success rate and low handoff time.",

Mobile e-health applications provide users and healthcare practitioners with an insightful way to check users/patients’ status and monitor their daily activities. This paper proposes a cloud-based mobile e-health calorie system that can classify food objects in the plate and further compute the overall calorie of each food object with high accuracy. The novelty in our system is that we are not only offloading heavy computational functions of the system to the cloud, but also employing an intelligent cloud-broker mechanism to strategically and efficiently utilize cloud instances to provide accurate and improved time response results. The broker system uses a dynamic cloud allocation mechanism that takes decisions on allocating and de-allocating cloud instances in real-time for ensuring the average response time stays within a predefined threshold. In this paper, we further demonstrate various scenarios to explain the workflow of the cloud components including: segmentation, deep learning, indexing food images, decision making algorithms, calorie computation, scheduling management as part of the proposed cloud broker model. The implementation results of our system showed that the proposed cloud broker results in a 45% gain in the overall time taken to process the images in the cloud. With the use of dynamic cloud allocation mechanism, we were able to reduce the average time consumption by 77.21% when 60 images were processed in parallel.",

With the rapid development of computation and communication technologies, peripheral or incremental changes in VANETs evolve into a revolution in process. Cloud computing as a solution has been deployed to satisfy vehicles in VANETs which are expected to require resources (such as computing, storage and networking). Recently, with special requirements of mobility, location awareness, and low latency, there has been growing interest in research into the role of fog computing in VANETs. The merging of fog computing with VANETs opens an area of possibilities for applications and services on the edge of the cloud computing. Fog computing deploys highly virtualized computing and communication facilities at the proximity of mobile vehicles in VANET. Mobile vehicles in VANET can also demand services of low-latency and short-distance local connections via fog computing. This paper presents the current state of the research and future perspectives of fog computing in VANETs. Moreover, we discuss the characteristics of fog computing and services based on fog computing platform provided for VANETs. In this paper, some opportunities for challenges and issues are mentioned, related techniques that need to be considered have been discussed in the context of fog computing in VANETs.

In departing from the traditional centralized model of manufacturing, decentralized manufacturing divides production across sites or geographic regions. This paradigm shift imposes significant structural and organisational changes on a business presenting both hidden challenges that must be addressed and opportunities to be embraced. By profoundly adapting business practices, significant advantages can be realized through a democratized value chain, creation of professional-level jobs without geographic restriction to the central hub and a flexibility in response to external pressures and demands. To realize these potential opportunities, however, advances in manufacturing technology and support systems are required, as well as significant changes in the way CGTs are regulated to facilitate multi-site manufacturing. Decentralized manufacturing is likely to be the manufacturing platform of choice for advanced health care therapies—in particular, those with a high degree of personalization. The future success of these promising products will be enhanced by adopting sound business strategies early in development. To realize the benefits that decentralized manufacturing of CGTs has to offer, it is important to examine both the risks and the substantial opportunities present. In this research, we examine both the challenges and the opportunities this shift in business strategy represents in an effort to maximize the success of adoption.",

abstract = "The “Big Room” in construction refers to a large facility supporting the colocation of the entire project team, where some of the critical problems such as delays in decision-making, problems in communication, disparity in design iterations are eliminated, and trust is increased. However, one of the most demanding aspects of this concept is the almost constant presence of the project participants, which may be difficult for small or medium projects. We therefore propose “Virtual Big Room”, where the concept of collocation of workers will be deployed through virtual technologies. A combination of product and process modelling techniques along with communication and social network tools are proposed to develop the proposed platform that will integrate the entire supply chain through the project lifecycle (i.e. design, construction, handover).",

The next trend of innovations is likely to come from humans' ability to connect to machines and the data that comes from these connections. The IBM Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) is a “system of systems” that is not intended to replace an existing physical infrastructure that gathers raw data. Instead, it is intended to extract only the data necessary to optimize the operations of the organization. The types of data and integration into the IOC make efficient problem solving solutions readily available to city authorities. The user interface and standard operating procedure and the resource processing capabilities of the IOC indicate that this system is optimal for smart cities of the future with regard to improvement of quality of life and ease of navigation. The need for smart cities, universities, campuses, citizens, and students to drive growth of urban and regional economies is evident. In this article, a thorough analysis of the architectural design of an intelligent operational system is completed to present a smart solution for cities to unify departments and agencies under one umbrella.",

In this interview, Paul Nicholson, responsible for global product marketing and strategy at A10 Networks, talks about how DDoS is becoming an ever-growing threat and what organisations can do about it. We’ve just witnessed the biggest distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in history, which turned seemingly harmless devices such as video recorders into cyber-weapons. With both the scale and frequency of attacks increasing, many organisations are left wondering how they can protect themselves and how those defences should be deployed, whether on-premise or in the cloud. In this interview with Paul Nicholson of A10 Networks, we examine how DDoS is becoming an ever-growing threat and what organisations can do about it.",

This paper conducts a survey of various wearable technologies that can be used to accurately quantify the rehabilitation progress in terms of fingers' hand joint angles. Based on the data acquisition methods, these technologies can be mainly divided into six categories: 1) Flex sensor based; 2) Accelerometer based; 3) Vision based; 4) Hall-effect based; 5) Stretch sensor based; and 6) Magnetic sensor based. The main focus of some of the discussed technologies has been on various other domains, like gaming gloves, tele-manipulation etc., and thus their usage for rehabilitation of hand joints could be quite interesting. This paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of these wearable technologies along with some examples of their implementations. Based on our survey results, we propose a wearable glove for accurately measuring hand joint angles with enhanced features for better diagnosis and rehabilitation.",

Among advanced technologies, AR in particular has the greatest potential to address those challenges and facilitate the translation of PNMs into formidable clinical application of personalized therapy. As AR is about to adapt additional new methods, such as speech, voice recognition, eye tracing and motion tracking, to enable interaction with host response or biological systems in 3-D space, a combination of multiple approaches to accommodate varying environmental conditions, such as public noise and atmosphere brightness, will be explored to improve its therapeutic outcomes in clinical applications. For instance, AR glasses still being developed by Facebook or Microsoft will serve as new platform that can provide people with the health information they are interested in or various measures through which they can interact with medical services. This review has addressed the current progress and impact of AR on PNMs and its application to the biomedical field.

Data congestion could take place in WSNs with a large number of nodes sending data periodically, or in WSNs where the data rate can increase when a specific event is detected.

An insecure communication channel between a tag and a reader makes the RFID implant system vulnerable to attacks and endangers the user's safety and privacy. The proposed scheme relies on elliptic curve cryptography and the D-Quark lightweight hash design. Compared to the available public-key cryptosystems, elliptic curve-based cryptosystems are the best choice due to their small key sizes as well as their efficiency in computations. The D-Quark lightweight hash design is tailored for resource constrained pervasive devices, cost, and performance. The security analysis of the proposed authentication scheme revealed that it is secure against the relevant threat models and provides a higher security level than related work found in the literature. The computational performance comparison shows that our work has 48% less communication overhead compared to existing similar schemes. It also requires 24% less total memory than the other approaches. The required computational time of our scheme is generally similar to other existing schemes. Hence, the presented scheme is a well-suited choice for providing security for the resource-constrained RFID implant systems.",

This research aims to evaluate the BIS maturity and its influences on decision quality to reveal the BIS impacts on hospital agility. To test the research model, opinions were collected by distributing questionnaires to clinical and administrative decision-makers who had experiences of using BIS in hospitals.

Hype draws attention to potential positive effects while excluding or under emphasizing a new technology's dependencies on other factors and its potential negative effects. Thus, hype presents a partial picture of technological innovation. In this paper, it is argued that dependencies and potential negative effects should be, and can be, included in the framing of new technologies. First, the limitations of hype are described with references to cases. Next, a template is provided to summarize big picture innovation framing. Dependencies for effectiveness and dependencies for efficient operation are included. This is because the potential of technological innovations to bring about positive effects is often dependent upon extraneous factors. Also, their efficient operation is often dependent upon many inter-related technological components. Potential negative effects are also included. Big picture framing is contrasted with the partial picture provided by hype. Then, examples of dependencies and potential negative effects are described for a range of technologies. Subsequently, a full example of big picture framing is provided for a hyped technology. In conclusion, it is argued that big picture framing can be a more informative starting point for understanding the potential of new technologies than vague hyperbole.",

abstract = "It is believed that anomalous mental states such as stress and anxiety not only cause suffering for the individuals, but also lead to tragedies in some extreme cases. The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical way to predict an individual’s mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals’ mental states.",

For this purpose, the present contribution proposes the conceptualization of the industrial software-product-service system. It is based upon empirical findings as well as theoretical considerations on the concept of industrial product-service systems and substantiated by suggested future research directions, derived with the help of the proposed conceptualization.",

In this context, a conceptual architecture for an ambient assisted living ecosystem is introduced with the objective of facilitating the development and provision of technology-supported integrated care and assistance services for senior citizens. These services are the result of collaboration among various stakeholders, enabled by the notion of collaborative ambient assisted living ecosystem. A 3-layered model is adopted for the architecture: Infrastructure layer, Care and Assistance Services layer, and Ambient Assisted Living ecosystem layer. The involved actors and their relationships are modeled as part of the architecture implementation specification. An example of service design in this context is also presented.",

For example, monitoring people with dementia using commercially available devices that measure heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and activity level could be used to predict episodic behavioral and psychological symptoms before they become distressing or disruptive. However, since these devices are designed primarily for fitness assessment, validation of the sensors in a controlled environment with the target cohort population is needed. In this study, we present validation results using a commercial fitness tracker, the Hexoskin sensor vest, with thirty-one participants aged 65 and older. Estimated physiological measures investigated in this study are heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and activity level of the participants. Findings indicate that while the processed step count, heart rate, and breathing rate show strong correlations to the clinically accepted gold standard values, lung volume and activity level do not. This indicates the need to proceed cautiously when making clinical decisions using such sensors, and suggests that users should focus on the three strongly correlated parameters for further analysis, at least in the older population. The use of physiological measurement devices such as the Hexoskin may eventually become a non-intrusive way to continuously assess physiological measures in older adults with dementia who are at risk for distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms.",

Utilizing the technology acceptance model (TAM) as the base framework, the current study extended the model by incorporating perceived enjoyment and perceived self-expressiveness, which are influenced by an individual’s vanity and need for uniqueness. The findings from 562 Korean respondents indicated that the characteristics of smartwatches as fashion products significantly explain the intention to use a smartwatch, particularly the individual’s desire for uniqueness. A limited effect of vanity on self-expressiveness implies that the smartwatch is not yet deemed a luxury commodity.

In most applications, sensor nodes are constrained in energy supply and communication bandwidth. Therefore, novel techniques to reduce energy inefficiencies and for efficient use of the limited bandwidth resources are essential. Such constraints combined with dense network deployment pose several challenges to the design and management of WSNs and require energy-awareness at all layers of the networking protocol stack. For instance, at the Data-Link layer, low duty cycle Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols trade off latency for energy efficient operation. In this paper, we present a survey of state-of-the-art low duty cycle MAC protocols. We first outline the design challenges for MAC protocols in WSNs. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of the most prominent and recent MAC protocols. These protocols are classified into synchronous and asynchronous based on their mode of operation.

The recent proliferation of big data provides numerous opportunities for information-intensive services (IISs), in which information interactions exert the greatest effect on value creation. In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in IISs is essential for using IT to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new IISs and by analyzing data usage in 149 IIS cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs. The main contribution of this study is to provide a simple yet comprehensive and empirically tested basis for the use and management of data to facilitate service value creation.",

Artificial neural network (ANN) approaches have the ability to solve complex decision-making problems that involve uncertainty and a large amount of information in a fast and reliable way. The application of this evolutionary CI technique to analyze a large amount of data is an important strategy to solve several problems in healthcare management. This paper proposes the modeling, performance evaluation, and comparison analysis of an ANN technique known as the radial basis function network (RBFNetwork) to identify possible cases of gestational diabetes that can lead to multiple risks for both the pregnant women and the fetus. This method achieved promising results with a precision of 0.785, F-measure of 0.786, ROC area of 0.839, and Kappa statistic of 0.5092. These indicators show that this ANN-based approach is an excellent predictor for gestational diabetes mellitus. This research provides a comprehensive decision-making model capable of improving the care provided to women who are at a risk of developing gestational diabetes, which is the most common metabolic problem in gestation with a prevalence of 3–18%. Thus, this work can contribute to the reduction of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity rates.",

abstract = "Motivation
Different e-health strategies may produce different long-term results, so it is of general interest to look into strategies behind e-health approaches, and what factors that influence strategy-formation.
Problem statement
Previous studies into process improvements in the e-health area has suggested that approaches and strategies are very dependent on national contexts. This study explores this issue, by sampling two national regions in Europe, the St. Gallen region and canton in Switzerland, and the Agder region comprised of the two Agder-counties, in Norway. The research questions revolve around the extent to which the context influences e-health innovation in two different European regions.
Approach
To throw light on the area of concern, the author performed a cross-sectional case-study into publicly known e-health research and innovation projects or implementation projects in the two regions at comparable level of analysis; transparent (public) collaborative projects with more than one autonomous partner, at least one being from the regions research-institutions or governmental bodies.
Results
This study reports that there were some different regional convergences within the mentioned framework. In general there seems to be a gap concerning studies around the extension of clinical systems into homecare in St. Gallen, and a gap concerning more cross-sectional, holistic studies in Agder.
Conclusions
This article summarizes by pointing out themes for further research that needs more attention, both in general and within each of the two contexts, as a recommendation to the research community. These themes may also have implications for practice.",

In the residential setting, the enhanced features and services provided by said computing devices constitute what is typically referred to as a “smart home”. However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues. This paper presents XSACd, a cross-domain resource sharing & access control framework for smart environments, combining the well-studied fine-grained access control provided by the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). Based on standardized technologies, it enables seamless interactions and fine-grained policy-based management of heterogeneous smart devices, including support for communication between distributed networks, via the associated MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT)–based proxies. The framework is implemented in full, and its performance is evaluated on a test bed featuring relatively resource-constrained smart platforms and embedded devices, verifying the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

abstract = "Wider availability of sensors and sensing systems has pushed research in the direction of automatic activity recognition (AR) either for medical or other personal benefits e.g. wellness or fitness monitoring. Researchers apply different AR techniques/algorithms and use a wide range of sensors to discover home activities. However, it seems that the AR algorithms are purely technology-driven rather than informing studies on the type and quality of input required. There is an expectation to over-instrument the environment or the subjects and then develop AR algorithms, where instead the problem should be approached from a different angle i.e. what sensors (type, quality and quantity) a given algorithm requires to infer particular activities with a certain confidence? This paper introduces the concept of activity recognition, its taxonomy and familiarises the reader with sub-classes of sensor-based AR. Furthermore, it presents an overview of existing health services Telecare and Telehealth solutions, and introduces the hierarchical taxonomy of human behaviour analysis tasks. This work is a result of a systematic literature review and it presents the reader with a comprehensive set of home-based activities of daily living (ADL) and sensors proven to recognise these activities. Apart from reviewing usefulness of various sensing technologies for home-based AR algorithms, it highlights the problem of technology-driven cycle of development in this area.",

However, such information, if precisely determined, can considerably enhance the effectiveness of the mobile application. On the basis of this concept, this study modified the existing fuzzy weighted average (FWA) nonlinear programming (NLP) approach by incorporating a mechanism of predicting a patient’s unknown preferences for different nearby clinics to improve the performance of ubiquitous clinic recommendation. The proposed methodology was applied to a small region in Taiwan, and the experimental results confirmed its superiority over four existing methods in effectively improving the successful recommendation rates for patients in both training and testing groups. Comparing the results of the proposed methodology with those of the original FWA-NLP approach revealed that the proposed methodology has an advantage because of the mechanism of predicting patients’ unknown preferences.",

abstract = "The growth of the mobile data services market is no longer dependent on push strategies from suppliers. On the contrary, demand is now driving the market to the extent that it will not be easy for mobile operating companies to cope up with the demand to come in the near future. Operators are forced to make heavy investments to upgrade and expand their networks, which then squeezes profits, as the evolution of income is not parallel to that of demand. On the other hand, the operators simply cannot refuse to take up the challenge. To decide how to handle the present and upcoming demand, they need to identify and understand the characteristics of the scenarios they face and will be facing. This is precisely the aim of this article, which provides figures on the consequences for mobile infrastructures of a generalised mobile data services uptake. To achieve this, the article collects information about the predicted evolution of different mobile services in the current and coming years and translates those expectations into service requirements. The paper closes with a discussion on the feasibility and the techno-economic implications for practical deployment, imposed by these requisites. Data from the Spanish mobile deployment case have been used to arrive at practical figures and illustration of results, but the conclusions are easily extended to other countries and regions.",

abstract = "In this study, we investigated how the structure and oxygen flow rate (OFR) during the sputter-deposition affects the photo-responses of amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO)-based photodetector devices. As the result of comparing three types of device structures with one another, which are a global Schottky diode, local Schottky diode, and thin-film transistor (TFT), the IGZO TFT with the gate pulse technique suppressing the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) is the most promising photodetector in terms of a high photo-sensitivity and uniform sensing characteristic. In order to analyze the IGZO TFT-based photodetectors more quantitatively, the time-evolution of sub-gap density-of-states (DOS) was directly observed under photo-illumination and consecutively during the PPC-compensating period with applying the gate pulse. It shows that the increased ionized oxygen vacancy (VO2+) defects under photo-illumination was fully recovered by the positive gate pulse and even overcompensated by additional electron trapping. Based on experimentally extracted sub-gap DOS, the origin on PPC was successfully decomposed into the hole trapping and the VO ionization. Although the VO ionization is enhanced in lower OFR (O-poor) device, the PPC becomes more severe in high OFR (O-rich) device because the hole trapping dominates the PPC in IGZO TFT under photo-illumination rather than the VO ionization and more abundant holes are trapped into gate insulator and/or interface in O-rich TFTs. Similarly, the electron trapping during the PPC-compensating period with applying the positive gate pulse becomes more prominent in O-rich TFTs. It is attributed to more hole/electron traps in the gate insulator and/or interface, which is associated with oxygen interstitials, or originates from the ion bombardment-related lower quality gate oxide in O-rich devices.",

Since these systems are embedded in a critical and dynamic environment, it is really important to have an infrastructure that is capable of providing real-time environmental information. This paper discusses two research questions that arise from adaptive ubicomp systems: (i) what are the key requirements to provide a reliable WSN-based system (e.g. a river monitoring system)? and (ii) how can an adaptable and reliable WSN-based system be developed? This paper seeks to respond to the former question with the aid of the RESS standard platform. The latter question is answered by employing a generic approach for adaptation. The term “critical systems”, means that any error may result in the loss of human life. We devised the RESS standard after deploying the WSN-based river monitoring system in Brazil for five years. Our prototype underwent several trials, sometimes leading to failure or damage, before we came up with a more reliable solution, which is outlined in this article. Finally, while our RESS platform is policy-free, it is extensible/adaptable and hence can naturally be adapted to new policies.",

Many one-way broadcast authentication protocol proposed such as Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA), Bin and Balls Authentication (BiBA), etc., which cannot provide energy efficient authentication.

abstract = "Industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) applications are mostly time-bound, mission-critical and highly delay sensitive applications therefore IWSN defines strict, stringent and unique QoS requirements such as timeliness, reliability and availability. In IWSN, unlike other sensor networks, late arrival of packets or delay or disruption to an on-going communication are considered as critical failure. Also, because IWSN is deployed in the overcrowded industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band it is difficult to meet this unique QoS requirements due to stiff competition for bandwidth from other technologies operating in ISM band resulting in scarcity of spectrum for reliable communication and/or disruption of ongoing communication. However, cognitive radio (CR) provides more spectral opportunities through opportunistic-use of unused licensed spectrum while ensuring minimal interference to licensed users. Similarly, spectrum handoff, which is a new type of handoff in cognitive radio, has the potential to offer increase bandwidth, reliable, smooth and interference-free communication for IWSNs through opportunistic-use of spectrum, minimal switching-delays, and efficient target channel selection strategies as well as effective link recovery maintenance. As a result, a new paradigm known as cognitive radio industrial wireless sensor network (CR-IWSN) has become the interest of recent research efforts. In this paper, we highlight and discuss important QoS requirements of IWSN as well as efforts of existing IWSN standards to address the challenges. We discuss the potential and how cognitive radio and spectrum handoff can be useful in the attempt to provide real-time reliable and smooth communication for IWSNs.",

While a variety of treatment options are available, ranging from pharmaceutical drugs to invasive neuromodulation, the clinical effects are inconsistent and often poorly measured. For instance, the lack of remote monitoring has been a major limitation to optimize therapeutic interventions for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). In this work, we focus on the assessment of full-body tremor as the most recognized PD symptom. Forty PD and twenty two healthy participants were recruited. The main assessment tool was an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion capture system to quantify full-body tremor and to separate tremor-dominant from non-tremor-dominant PD patients as well as from healthy controls. We developed a new measure and evaluated its clinical utility by correlating the results with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores as the gold standard. Significant correlation was observed between the UPDRS and the tremor severity scores for the selected tasks. The results suggest that it is feasible and clinically meaningful to utilize the suggested objective tremor score for the assessment of PD patients. Furthermore, this portable assessment tool could potentially be used in the home environment to monitor PD tremor and facilitate optimizing therapeutic interventions.",

abstract = "Cloud Computing offers virtualized computing, storage, and networking resources, over the Internet, to organizations and individual users in a completely dynamic way. These cloud resources are cheaper, easier to manage, and more elastic than sets of local, physical, ones. This encourages customers to outsource their applications and services to the cloud. The migration of both data and applications outside the administrative domain of customers into a shared environment imposes transversal, functional problems across distinct platforms and technologies. This article provides a contemporary discussion of the most relevant functional problems associated with the current evolution of Cloud Computing, mainly from the network perspective. The paper also gives a concise description of Cloud Computing concepts and technologies. It starts with a brief history about cloud computing, tracing its roots. Then, architectural models of cloud services are described, and the most relevant products for Cloud Computing are briefly discussed along with a comprehensive literature review. The paper highlights and analyzes the most pertinent and practical network issues of relevance to the provision of high-assurance cloud services through the Internet, including security. Finally, trends and future research directions are also presented.",

abstract = "Background
Workers at tertiary health facilities may be expected to have good knowledge of cervical cancer and also good screening practices so that they could be good sources of health information and motivation to promote screening in the general public. An assessment of their perceptions and practice of cervical screening could reveal gaps that would inspire efforts to improve key indicators among them and in turn, the general population.
Methods
This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 316 workers of a tertiary health facility selected by stratified random sampling with proportionate allocation. Data was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires and analysed with SPSS 20 and PEPI programs.
Results
The majority of respondents were aware of cervical cancer but it was significantly higher among females, p=.001. Most respondents, 266 (84.2%) were less than 40 years of age but knowledge of cervical cancer screening diminished with increase in age, p=.039. Only 92 (29%) had good knowledge of cervical screening; a better knowledge of cervical screening was significantly associated with working in a clinical department, employment duration of less than 2 years, and being female. All females who had ever screened for Ca cervix, 18 (11%) had a Pap smear, and majority 15 (83%) had screened only once. Factors associated with screening were level of education, years of work experience, and being in a clinical department. Reasons given for not screening included pain from the procedure, its cost, and the delay with getting results.
Conclusion
Knowledge of cervical screening was not good among staff of DELSUTH and practice of screening was also very poor. They may benefit from health education and promotion programmes directed towards better screening practices. Introduction of easier-to-perform and less costly screening modalities like VIA/VILI may also improve uptake.",

Moreover, the system is using sensors in vehicles to provide a user-friendly platform to communicate with users. Now, the exchange of authentication message between authenticated entities are two important issues for successful implementation of a smart vehicular system. In the proposed vehicular system, there are three entities involve namely users, sink and sensor. In the same architecture, there is two set of communication between user to sink and sink to sensor are needed. In short, we have proposed an architecture of data traffic/movement in vehicular sensor network and authenticate the entities. In addition, we have analyzed our protocol with respect to security attacks and found that it is strongly protected against security attacks.

We describe a discrete event simulation model that uses information about integrated physical and cyber security systems, attacker characteristics and simple response rules to identify key safeguards that limit an attacker's likelihood of success. Key features of the proposed model include comprehensive data generation to support a variety of sophisticated analyses, and full parameterization of safeguard performance characteristics and attacker behaviours to evaluate a range of scenarios.

This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘(’omic)’ approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established’omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially SNPs and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.",

Conventional outcome measures (COMs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) refer to rating scales, questionnaires, patient diaries and clinically-based tests that do not require specialized equipment.
Methods
It is timely at this juncture - as clinicians and researchers begin to grapple with the “invasion” of digital technologies - to review the strengths and weaknesses of these outcome measures.
Results
This paper discusses advances (including an enhanced understanding of PD itself, and the development of clinimetrics as a field) that have led to improvements in the COMs used in PD; their strengths and limitations; and factors to consider when selecting and using a measuring instrument.
Conclusions
It is envisaged that in the future, a combination of COMs and technology-based objective measures will be utilized, with different methods having their own strengths and weaknesses. Judgement is required on the part of the clinician and researcher in terms of which instrument(s) are appropriate to use, depending on the particular clinical or research setting or question.",

This research develops a conceptual model and hypotheses based on the theory of reasoned action and perceived values from the perspectives of software, hardware, and aesthetic design. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed on popular websites to collect data, and 260 usable responses are collected from the potential users of the Apple Watch in Taiwan. The thirteen hypotheses were validated by using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Among the antecedents of purchase intention in the model, the attitude towards using smartwatches was found to have the strongest direct effect. Among the factors of the attitude, design aesthetics have the most significant effect. The results also show that all of the factors about smartwatch attributes directly affected the related perceived values. However, social value and performance/quality value did not affect the intention. The model demonstrated relatively good explanatory power for purchase intention in the context of smartwatches. The proposed model can provide insights to smartwatch vendors to develop their new products and marketing strategies.",

abstract = "Anomaly detection systems are usually employed to monitor database activities in order to detect security incidents. These systems raise an alert when anomalous activities are detected. The raised alerts have to be analyzed to timely respond to the security incidents. Their analysis, however, is time-consuming and costly. This problem increases with the large number of alerts often raised by anomaly detection systems. To timely and effectively handle security incidents, alerts should be accompanied by information which allows the understanding of incidents and their context (e.g., root causes, attack type) and their prioritization (e.g., criticality level). Unfortunately, the current state of affairs regarding the information about alerts provided by existing anomaly detection systems is not very satisfactory. This work presents an anomaly analysis framework that facilitates the analysis of alerts raised by an anomaly detection system monitoring a database system. The framework provides an approach to assess the criticality of alerts with respect to the disclosure of sensitive information and a feature-based classification of alerts according to their associated type of attack. The framework has been deployed as a web-based alert audit tool that provides alert classification and risk-based ranking capabilities, significantly easing the analysis of alerts. We validate the classification and ranking approaches using synthetic data generated through an existing healthcare management system.",

With the advent of IoT and the associated variety of pervasive and context-aware applications, there is an increasing requirement to support the execution of these applications on devices with limited processing power. This is a cost-intensive process as this usually requires the deployment of centralized computing infrastructure accessible via a cloud interface. We envision a distributed execution environment comprised of diverse computing resources as an alternative solution to this problem. This execution environment can be defined as a mobile cloud. However, the inherent unreliability of the mobile cloud requires developers to add reliability within the applications separately making the development process tedious. In this position paper, we present Aegis - a framework that provides a reliable and unified computing platform with built-in failure detection and repair mechanisms. Aegis draws upon the actor based execution model as well as stream processing applications to provide a reliable overlay over unreliable environments. Aegis also relives developers of the task of adding reliability mechanisms to applications separately.",

abstract = "It is clear that big data has numerous potential impacts in many fields. However, few papers discussed its applications in the field of safety science research. Additionally, there exist many problems that cannot be ignored when big data is applied to safety science, most outstanding of which is lack of universal supporting theory that guides how to apply big data to safety science research like methods, principles and approaches, etc. In other terms, it is not enough for big data to be viewed asa strong enabler for safety science applications mainly due to lack of universal and basic theory from the perspective of safety science. Considering the above analyzes, the two key objectives of this paper are: (1) to propose the connotation of safety big data (SBD) and its applying rules, methods and principles, and (2) to put forward some application prospects and challenges of big data to safety science research seen from theoretical research. First, by comparing SBD and traditional safety small data (SSD) from four aspects including theoretical research, typical research method, specific analysis method and processing mode, this paper puts forward the definition and connotation of SBD. Subsequently this paper further summarizes and extracts the application rules and methods of SBD. And then nine principles of SBD are explored and their relationship and application are addressed from the view of theory architecture and working framework in data processing flow. At last, this paper also discusses the potential applications and some hot issues of SBD. Overall, this paper will play an essential role in supporting the application of SBD. In addition, it will fill in the theory gaps in the field of SBD beyond traditional safety statistics, and further enriches the contents of safety science.",

However, these systems usually operate in complex environments that entail uncertain, highly dynamic, or irregular workload. In such environments, autonomous agents tend to make decisions that lead to undesirable outcomes. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-logic-based adjustable autonomy (FLAA) model to manage the autonomy of multi-agent systems that are operating in complex environments. This model aims to facilitate the autonomy management of agents and help them make competent autonomous decisions. The FLAA model employs fuzzy logic to quantitatively measure and distribute autonomy among several agents based on their performance. We implement and test this model in the Automated Elderly Movements Monitoring (AEMM-Care) system, which uses agents to monitor the daily movement activities of elderly users and perform fall detection and prevention tasks in a complex environment. The test results show that the FLAA model improves the accuracy and performance of these agents in detecting and preventing falls.",

abstract = "In many countries across the world a universal issue of growing concern is increasing demand for health services and corresponding escalating costs. While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.",

The moving object detection is applied on thermal video because it penetrate challenging problems such as dynamic issues of background and illumination variation. In this work, we have proposed a new background subtraction method using Fisher’s linear discriminant ratio based threshold. This threshold is investigated automatically during run-time for each pixel of every sequential frame. Automatically means to avoid the involvement of external source such as programmer or user for threshold selection. This threshold provides better pixel classification at run-time. This method handles problems generated due to multiple behavior of background more accurately using Fisher’s ratio. It maximizes the separation between object pixel and the background pixel. To check the efficacy, the performance of this work is observed in terms of various parameters depicted in analysis. The experimental results and their analysis demonstrated better performance of proposed method against considered peer methods.",

As a consequence, more and more sophisticated packet screening/filtering solutions are deployed everywhere, typically on network border devices, in order to sanitize Internet traffic. Despite the obvious benefits associated to the proactive detection of security threats, these devices, by performing deep packet inspection and inline analysis, may both affect latency-sensitive traffic introducing non-negligible delays, and increase the energy demand at the network element level. Starting from these considerations, we present a selective routing and intrusion detection technique based on dynamic statistical analysis. Our technique separates latency-sensitive traffic from latency-insensitive one and adaptively organizes the intrusion detection activities over multiple nodes. This allows suppressing directly at the network ingress, when possible, all the undesired components of latency-insensitive traffic and distributing on the innermost nodes the security check for latency sensitive flows, prioritizing routing activities over security scanning ones. Our final goal is demonstrating that selective intrusion detection can result in significant energy savings without adversely affecting latency-sensitive traffic by introducing unacceptable processing delays.",

Moreover any mismatch in capacities may render multi-million dollar investments to zero returns on investment. Simulation can help foresee changes on the shop floor when demand changes. Providing a library of components that can be assembled together is the usual approach used by many simulation vendors which still leaves a simulation engineer in the loop to make it usable. We detail our experiences on implementing a prototype (private) cloud service using service broker architecture and a dynamic model generator. The service broker handles the heterogeneity associated with demand and equipment configurations whereas the dynamic model generator customizes a generic model based on inputs from the user. This helps avoiding rewiring of simulation models on each engagement. The schema and the necessary front and back-end codes all reside in the cloud and, therefore, users pay on a per use basis without worrying about the upgrade/update of software at their end. The service supports multi-tenancy which results in low costs per user and provides sharing of resource information yet restricting access to proprietary workflows and policies. A typical run costs a very small amount, which is affordable for even small-sized PSPs. We show the utility of our work in the context of educational book publishing to evaluate equipment changes needed when the current lumpy order demand stream changes to a highly fragmented demand stream. We also discuss how our work can be extended to several other domains such healthcare, transportation, 3D printing.",

However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage.

Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers’ attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers’ behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions.",

abstract = "The recent spectacular progress in the microelectronic, information, communication, material and sensor technologies created a big stimulus towards development of much more sophisticated, coherent and fit to use, smart communicating cyber-physical systems (CPS). The huge and rapidly developing markets of the modern CPS represent great opportunities for both private enterprises and country economies. However, these opportunities come with a price of unusual systems complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of the modern CPS applications. Specifically, numerous mobile and autonomous CPS applications require a. o. a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance or (ultra-)low energy consumption, as well as, a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these problems and overcome the related challenges a sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After a brief introduction to modern CPS and consideration of several serious challenges of their design, this paper discusses the embedded computing technology needed for the modern complex and highly-demanding mobile and autonomous CPS.",

In this study, we propose and design a low-cost and widely deployable strategy for empowering emergency rescuers through an intelligent mobile psychological self-help tool. This tool will help reduce the gap between the limited number of qualified professional counsellors and the high demand for timely psychological support by rescuers. We start with a thorough investigation of user requirements, extant work, and relevant IS design theories to inform our system design choices, among which we identified that “virtual advisor identity” (VAI) needs further research. We then empirically examined how VAI influences the empowerment effect of ERMS. Involving 120 emergency rescuers who have just finished rescue tasks, our experiment shows that VAI has important effects on a user’s cognitive and emotional routes, which are significant empowering enablers that lead to positive empowerment outcomes. Interestingly, virtual peer advisor empowers users mostly through evoking emotional resonance from them, whereas virtual expert advisor is better at empowering users through cognitive channels. Important theoretical and practical implications of the findings are then discussed.",

Present-day wearables are typically battery-powered, and their limited lifetime has become the critical issue. Most devices need recharging every few days or even hours, falling short of the expectations for a truly satisfactory user experience. This paper presents the design, implementation and in-field evaluation of InfiniTime, a novel sensor-rich smart bracelet powered by energy harvesting. It is designed to achieve self-sustainability using solar cells with only modest indoor light levels and thermoelectric generators (TEG’s) with small temperature gradients from the body heat. The wearable device is equipped with an ultra-low power camera and a microphone, in addition to accelerometer and temperature sensors commonly used in commercial devices. Experimental characterization of the fully operational prototype demonstrates a wide range of energy optimization techniques used to achieve self-sustainability with harvested energy only. Our experiments in real-world scenarios show an average of up to 550μW for photovoltaic in indoor and 98μW for TEG with only 3° temperature gradient and up to 250μW for 5° gradient. Simulations using energy intake measurements from solar and TEG modules confirm that InfiniTime achieves self-sustainability with indoor lighting levels and body heat for several realistic applications featuring data acquisition from the on-board camera and multiple sensors, as well as visualization and wireless connectivity. The highly optimized low-power architecture of the presented prototype features image acquisitions at 1.15 frames per second, powered only from the energy harvesters.",

However, selection of the number of experts and assignment of the input to individual experts remain elusive, especially for highly nonlinear and nonstationary systems. This paper presents a novel mixture of experts, namely, nonparametric multi-scale Gaussian process (MGP) experts to predict the dynamic evolution of such complex systems. Concretely, intrinsic time-scale decomposition is first used to iteratively decompose the time series generated from such complex systems into a series of proper rotation components and a baseline trend component. Those components delineate the true time-frequency-energy patterns of the complex systems at different granularity. A Gaussian process (GP) expert is then applied on each component to predict the system evolution at each scale. MGP circumvent the tedious selection and assignment problems via the nonparametric ITD. Summation of those individual forecasts represents the overall evolution of the original time series. Case studies using synthetic and real-world data elucidated that the proposed MGP model significantly outperforms conventional autoregressive models, composite GP model, and support vector regression in terms of prediction accuracy, and it is particularly effective for multi-step forecasting.",

Since sensing results of Body Area Networks (BAN) can directly impact the control of medical equipment, the authenticity and integrity of sensing data is essential for safety of patients. Restricted by the limited resources available to BAN sensors, researchers have referred to Physical Unclonable Function of the nodes to achieve authentication. Existing approaches focus on the authentication between control unit and sensors. Mutual authentication between sensor pairs or among sensor groups has not been carefully studied. In this paper, we propose to design several mutual authentication mechanisms for BAN sensor pairs and sensor groups with physical unclonable functions (PUF). Using control unit as a middle point, the body sensors can establish shared secrets so that authenticity of exchanged data can be protected. In sensor groups of BAN, we design both control unit based and sensor based sender authentication mechanisms. To reduce hardware demand and overhead, the proposed approaches do not require sensors to conduct any encryption operations, which suits the restricted resources available to BAN nodes. We design probability based schemes to defend against collusive sender impersonation attacks. We formally prove the safety of the protocols. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed approaches have low overhead and are robust against multiple types of attacks.",

This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.",

With the explosion of connected devices, it is essential for conversion gateway between the Internet and sensor nodes to support end-to-end (e2e) interoperability because the current Internet Protocol (IT) does not support end-to-end delay in IEEE 802.15.4e. As part of IoT, we propose a scheduling scheme of multiple channels and multiple timeslots to minimize the e2e delay in multi-hop environments. The proposed greedy heuristic approach is compared with the meta-heuristics in terms of the given end-to-end delay bound. Although the meta-heuristics is more accurate in finding a global optimum or sub-optimal values than the greedy heuristic approach, this advantage comes at the expense of high complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the complexity by obtaining suboptimal solutions that satisfy the e2e delay requirement.",

We find that technology either augments or substitutes service employees, and can foster network connections. In turn, employees and customers are taking on the role of enabler, innovator, coordinator and differentiator. In addition, we identify critical areas for future research on this important topic.",

abstract = "Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.",

Several of the limitations involve routing and reliability, and one of the key challenges is localization without the aid of global positioning services. On the one hand, GPS tends to be efficiently used only in open areas, and on the other hand, if integrated, the hardware overhead cost could be increased and there could be a smaller the battery lifetime. Thus, with the distance estimation derived from the received signal strength, a range-free localization scheme is promising as a cost-effective approach in which one of the optimization approaches is based on soft computing (which is typically used to address uncertainty and approximation) to achieve practicability and robustness. Thus, this research investigates probable soft computing techniques that are comparatively applied to localizations in a variety of components and subsequently proposes an alternative scheme that utilizes an extreme learning machine to increase the estimation accuracy. To enhance its precision further with a time complexity trade-off, a greedy-based approach that combines modified mass–spring optimizations is integrated and then evaluated by the simulation; these techniques demonstrate effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art soft-computing-based range-free localization schemes.",

abstract = "Background
Bariatric surgery research, often longitudinal, bears the challenge of maintaining retention and decreasing attrition of participants to avoid bias.
Objectives
To explore factors influencing the retention and attrition for bariatric surgical research participants.
Methods
Databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and others. As a secondary aim, studies reporting on retention/attrition factors in clinical follow-up visits were included.
Results
Of the 1145 articles retrieved, 44 met inclusion criteria, and underwent qualitative analysis. Four descriptive articles focused on longitudinal research participation and 40 on clinical follow-up visits. Willingness to participate in research was high (92%) and decreased with more invasive procedures or extra visits. A large observational longitudinal study presented 24-month retention/attrition data (92% for some data and 66% visit completion) and the retention strategies employed. One study indicated that research follow-up possibly increased clinical follow-up and another demonstrated a higher retention by increasing compensation. No consistent, modifiable demographic or psychosocial variables associated or predictive of retention or attrition in clinical follow-up were identified.
Conclusions
Research on factors related to participant retention and attrition is sparse. It is essential for studies to document retention/attrition data. Existing research has demonstrated a patient willingness to participate in research and that retention strategies have been successful in the short term. Further research should explore the motivations, perspectives and attitudes of bariatric surgical research participants regarding participation and explore predictors to develop evidence-based retention strategies. Research has yet to identify consistent and modifiable demographic or psychosocial variables predictive of clinical follow-up, possibly due to the heterogeneity of follow-up across studies. Further investigation into follow-up definition, content, counseling approaches, and new telemedicine technologies may prove helpful in developing predictors and evidence-based strategies. The relationship between research and clinical retention and attrition deserves further characterization.",

However, the existing cybersecurity workforce has not been sufficient for satisfying the increasing demand for qualified cybersecurity professionals, and the shortfall will increase in the next years. Meanwhile, to address the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, academic institutions have been establishing cybersecurity programs, particularly, cybersecurity master programs. This paper aims at analysing which cybersecurity topics are covered by existing cybersecurity master programs of top universities and how these topics are distributed through courses. It starts by reviewing the evolution and maturation of the cybersecurity discipline, focusing on the ACM efforts, which include the early addition of the Information Assurance and Security Knowledge Areas to the computer science curricula and, more recently, the development of curricular recommendations to support the definition of post-secondary cybersecurity programs. These latest guidelines are used to analyse and review 21 cybersecurity master programs, focusing on the contents of their courses, structure, admission requirements, duration, requirements for completion, and evolution.",

Modern enterprises collect big data from various inbound and outbound data sources. The inbound data sources handle data generated from the results of business operations, such as manufacturing, supply chain management, marketing, and human resource management, among others. Outbound data sources handle customer-generated data which are acquired directly or indirectly from customers, market analysis, surveys, product reviews, and transactional histories. However, cloud service utilization costs increase because of big data analytics and value creation activities for enterprises and customers. This article presents a novel concept of big data reduction at the customer end in which early data reduction operations are performed to achieve multiple objectives, such as (a) lowering the service utilization cost, (b) enhancing the trust between customers and enterprises, (c) preserving privacy of customers, (d) enabling secure data sharing, and (e) delegating data sharing control to customers. We also propose a framework for early data reduction at customer end and present a business model for end-to-end data reduction in enterprise applications. The article further presents a business model canvas and maps the future application areas with its nine components. Finally, the article discusses the technology adoption challenges for value creation through big data reduction in enterprise applications.",

As verified in the tests on simulated noisy ECG signals, QRSMR outputs with seriously contaminated ECG signals have an increase of the correlation with their original clean signals from 40% to nearly 80%, demonstrating the improved noise removal ability of QRSMR. Moreover, in the tests on real ECG signals measured on volunteers with a flexible wearable ECG monitoring device developed at Fudan University, QRSMR is able to recover P-wave and T-wave from the contaminated signal, which shows its enhanced performance on motion artifact reduction comparing with adaptive filtering method and other methods based only on empirical mode decomposition.",

In this paper, we develop social theory that aims to provide a better understanding of the prominent role of phatic technologies in society. We proceed in three stages: first, we critique and revise Giddens’ vague concept of symbolic tokens and its implications for time space distanciation by introducing novel concepts from measurement science. This focuses on forms of information that are relatively precise and communal. Secondly, building on our new formulation of abstract systems, we propose new sociological concepts, phatic systems and symbolic indicators, to enable social theory to explore and analyse the rise of phatic technologies. The concepts focus on the personal and emotional. Thirdly, reflecting on the fact that our digital society is held together by software, we introduce concepts from theoretical computer science to relate the abstract sociological idea of phatic systems and symbolic indicators to the concrete nature of digital data.",

abstract = "Wireless Body Area Networks (BAN) are supposed to operate in very low transmit power regime in order to keep the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) low. Low power transmissions are known to be very error prone. However, high reliability of communications is needed for several healthcare applications. It has been observed that the fluctuations of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) at the nodes of a BAN on a moving person show certain regularities and that the magnitude of these fluctuations are significant (5 – 20 dB). In this paper, we present BANMAC, a medium access control (MAC) protocol based on cross-layer design approach where medium access decisions are tightly integrated with physical layer conditions. BANMAC monitors and predicts the channel fluctuations and schedules transmissions opportunistically when the RSS is likely to be higher. We report the design and implementation details of BANMAC integrated with the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack. We present experimental data which show that the packet loss rate (PLR) of BANMAC is significantly lower as compared to that of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. For comparable PLR, the energy consumption of BANMAC is also significantly lower than that of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.",

abstract = "Big data has a strong demand for a network infrastructure with the capability to support data sharing and retrieval efficiently. Information-centric networking (ICN) is an emerging approach to satisfy this demand, where big data is cached ubiquitously in the network and retrieved using data names. However, existing authentication and authorization schemes rely mostly on centralized servers to provide certification and mediation services for data retrieval. This causes considerable traffic overhead for the secure distributed sharing of data. To solve this problem, we employ identity-based cryptography (IBC) to propose a Distributed Authentication and Authorization Scheme (DAAS), where an identity-based signature (IBS) is used to achieve distributed verifications of the identities of publishers and users. Moreover, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is used to enable the distributed and fine-grained authorization. DAAS consists of three phases: initialization, secure data publication, and secure data retrieval, which seamlessly integrate authentication and authorization with the interest/data communication paradigm in ICN. In particular, we propose trustworthy registration and Network Operator and Authority Manifest (NOAM) dissemination to provide initial secure registration and enable efficient authentication for global data retrieval. Meanwhile, Attribute Manifest (AM) distribution coupled with automatic attribute update is proposed to reduce the cost of attribute retrieval. We examine the performance of the proposed DAAS, which shows that it can achieve a lower bandwidth cost than existing schemes.",

From the data gathered, common research themes will be identified, such as comparisons among Asian countries of background factors in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. This is the first Asia-wide study of prostate cancer and has developed from single country research efforts in this field, including in Japan and Korea. At the Second Meeting, participating countries and regions discussed the status of preparations and discussed various issues that are being faced. These issues include technical challenges in creating databases, promoting participation in each country or region, clarifying issues relating to data input, addressing institutional issues such as institutional review board requirements, and the need for dedicated data managers. The meeting was positioned as an opportunity to share information and address outstanding issues prior to the initiation of the study.

From the cornerstone analysis of pervasive computing principles applied to Smart Spaces creation, this article presents the μSMS (micro Subscription Management System) middleware. This approach specifies and develops the notion of virtual sensor services created for Smart Environments over sensor networks from tiny in-network services based on agent technology. In the framework of the μSWN European Research Project, this architecture has been validated in a Smart Hospital real-world scenario using a healthcare virtual sensor service. Considering such purpose, medical status monitoring, location tracking and perimeter surveillance agent-based services have been developed. This study is concluded by a comparative analysis of the system considering memory overhead, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and battery lifetime as evaluation metrics. The results show a lightweight middleware implementation with good overall system and network performance.",

The current Internet paradigm, which is infrastructure-centric, is not the right one to cope with such emerging scenario with a wider range of applications. This calls for a radically new Internet paradigm, that we name the Internet of People (IoP), where the humans and their personal devices are not seen merely as end users of applications, but become active elements of the Internet. Note that IoP is not a replacement of the current Internet infrastructure, but it exploits legacy Internet services as (reliable) primitives to achieve end-to-end connectivity on a global-scale. In this visionary paper, we first discuss the key features of the IoP paradigm along with the underlying research issues and challenges. Then we present emerging networking and computing paradigms that are anticipating IoP.",

Then, we introduce a sensitivity analysis method dedicated to the BCC receiver by means of a receiver gain and an output noise spectral density. To verify the sensitivity analysis method, we implemented a direct conversion BCC receiver in 0.18μm CMOS technology. By measuring the gain, output spectral density, and sensitivity of the receiver with respect to the various source impedance values, we found that the calculated value through the proposed analysis method agrees well with the theoretical value within 2.5dB difference.",

abstract = "Context: Big Data systems are a class of software systems that ingest, store, process and serve massive amounts of heterogeneous data, from multiple sources. Despite their undisputed impact in current society, their engineering is still in its infancy and companies find it difficult to adopt them due to their inherent complexity. Existing attempts to provide architectural guidelines for their engineering fail to take into account important Big Data characteristics, such as the management, evolution and quality of the data. Objective: In this paper, we follow software engineering principles to refine the λ-architecture, a reference model for Big Data systems, and use it as seed to create Bolster, a software reference architecture (SRA) for semantic-aware Big Data systems. Method: By including a new layer into the λ-architecture, the Semantic Layer, Bolster is capable of handling the most representative Big Data characteristics (i.e., Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability and Veracity). Results: We present the successful implementation of Bolster in three industrial projects, involving five organizations. The validation results show high level of agreement among practitioners from all organizations with respect to standard quality factors. Conclusion: As an SRA, Bolster allows organizations to design concrete architectures tailored to their specific needs. A distinguishing feature is that it provides semantic-awareness in Big Data Systems. These are Big Data system implementations that have components to simplify data definition and exploitation. In particular, they leverage metadata (i.e., data describing data) to enable (partial) automation of data exploitation and to aid the user in their decision making processes. This simplification supports the differentiation of responsibilities into cohesive roles enhancing data governance.",

Source Location Privacy (SLP) protection is an essential problem in security. To enhance SLP in WSNs, in this paper, we propose a trace cost based source location privacy protection scheme (TCSLP) in WSNs for smart cities. First, we construct a phantom area to position phantom source nodes far away from the real source node. Second, we combine shortest path routing and random routing to send packets to improve the location privacy of the source node. Then, to decrease the trace speed of adversary, we design a special trace cost area, which consists of many sensor nodes with different weights in mountains, plains, and forest. Finally, packets are routed in a ring around the sink node. The ring consists of many nodes that are chosen from nearby grids. Compared with source location protection based on limited flooding (SLP) and enhanced source location protection protocol based on SLP (SLP-E), which allows the packet to be transmitted in any direction but fails to consider the overused nodes, our proposed scheme can avoid overused nodes and reduce overlapping path. Simulation results show that TCSLP can increase safety time and enhance SLP in WSNs for smart cities.",

Those activities will be, in the near future, the foundations of the emerging Internet of Living Things. The concept of Internet of Living Things has been introduced to characterize networks of biological sequencing sensors, which could rely on cloud-based analysis capabilities, to support the users in deeply studying DNA or other molecules. Sequencing sensors have many fields of application and much more will likely to come. In this context, DNA microarray images represent the core of modern genomic data analysis, since they allow the simultaneous monitoring of many thousands of genes and represent a sort of “container”, not only for storing genomics data, but also for managing, sharing and exchanging such type of data. In this scenario, the ability to protect genomics and medical big data is a growing challenge. In particular, for what concerns DNA microarray images, the techniques commonly employed for data protection are not effective due for example to the unauthorized use or manipulation after decryption or the lost of metadata during image processing. In this paper we address the problem of protecting such type of information, by means of watermarking techniques. In particular, we propose reversible watermarking techniques explicitly tailored for the characteristics of DNA microarray images to ensure the protection of such images in terms of authenticity and integrity, besides enabling the binding of those imaging data with other information related to them. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques by means of a working prototype.",

They are seeking to improve environmental effectiveness in the context of connected communities, global competitiveness, economic development, climate change, and demographic shifts. Virtually all proposed solutions to energy consumption and climate change acknowledge the role ICT plays as a key enabler of environmental effectiveness. One of the major challenges that the ICT sector faces today is that hardware is being pushed to its physical limits. The traditional means to reduce product size, increase functionality and enhance computing capabilities are becoming difficult and expensive every passing day. On the other hand, the industry is benefiting from nanotechnology advances with numerous applications including those in smarter sensors, logic elements, computer chips, memory storage devices, optoelectronics, quantum computing, etc. This paper presents an overview of the ICT benefiting from development in nanotechnology with respect to sustainability and energy efficiency.",

For that purpose, we design and study appropriate early and late fusion schemes to increase accuracy. The incorporation of mechanical variables, such as jerk, improves the recognition accuracy of activities that require fine motion. In addition, we describe a framework for semantic activity representation and interpretation, using Semantic Web technologies for building interoperable activity graphs. The system is personalized, as deployment-specific activity models are authored, while problems related to the disease are detected by rules. Complemented by lifelogging applications, the system is able to support interventions by clinicians, and endorse a feeling of safety and inclusion for end-users and their carers.",

The paper first discusses the need to take into account other interdisciplinary aspects of robot technology to offer complete legal coverage to citizens. As the European Union starts using impact assessment methodology for completing new technologies regulations, a new methodology based on it to approach the insertion of personal care robots will be discussed. Then, after framing the discussion with a use case, analysis of the involved legal challenges will be conducted. Some concrete scenarios will contribute to easing the explanatory analysis.",

abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

The polymer structure is analyzed by NMR and FTIR spectroscopies, showing the formation of linear aliphatic chains with methyl-oxy-benzene sulfonate side groups. SEM observations of the polymer morphology show that a thin (∼300 nm) and continuous layer is obtained depending on the electrochemical synthesis conditions. The combination of a mobile aliphatic backbone, ether groups with reduced cation affinity and immobile anions grafted on the side chains allows obtaining a single lithium-ion conducting polymer. Half-cell battery tests against Li metal show an excellent cycling performance with high areal capacity (up to 110 μAh cm−2) and very good retention especially at large C-rates, studied up to 12 C.",

abstract = "Since Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of nodes with limited power resources, methods that extend their energy lifespan are always in the spotlight. A potential method is the use of RF-power harvesting antennas which can absorb energy from radio frequency (RF) signals and transform a part of it into electricity. Dedicated energy transmitters (ETs) are used to emit power to the nodes. In this paper, we model the amount of harvesting energy as a function of several parameters such as the received power, the efficiency of the harvesting module and the transmission time. We consider a simple communication model that separates the ETs’ transmissions with the node data transmissions to avoid interference whilst we allow multi-hop energy transfer between the nodes when it is achievable. However, the ultimate purpose of this paper is to examine whether the cost of the investment of using energy harvesting nodes can be covered by achieving a lower operation cost; that is longer and cheaper operation times and, thus, less frequent maintenance. We consider several scenarios with different node densities and transmitter populations. Simulation results show that the use of RF-energy harvesting nodes can save a significant amount of energy, while the cost of the investment can be (theoretically) covered in less than 7 years for dense networks.",

Meanwhile, plenty of temperature-sensing devices were researched and developed. This paper firstly introduces a Ni thin film-based resistive temperature sensing device on a cylindrical PET monofilament which has excellent flexibility and a simple fabrication process in room temperature. The structure of the Ni resistive temperature-sensing device is very simple due to the Ni thin film deposition by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering which requires no pattern. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) indicates the temperature sensitivity of the Ni resistive temperature-sensing device. By calculating the resistance from I–V curves, the TCR shows a constant value of 2.44×10−3°C−1. Even after a repetitive bending and washing process of the PET monofilament which we report for the first time, the TCR maintains a high value ranging from 1.52×10−3°C−1 to 3.13×10−3°C−1. The results demonstrate that the PET monofilament combined with the Ni thin film can be a good candidate for a resistive temperature-sensing device.",

abstract = "In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one’s knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.",

In this work, we present a general framework that, by using the Matrix Factorization (MF) approach and a graph representation of a museum, addresses the problem of generating and then recommending an artworks sequence for a group of visitors within a museum. To reach a high-quality initial personalization, the recommendation system uses a simple, but efficient, elicitation method that is inspired by the MF approach.

Standardisation plays a key role in shaping the rules that govern these developments and their effects on society. Due to the large variety of actors involved in these trends, the associated standardisation processes are likely to involve all three modes of standardisation identified in the literature: committee-based, market-based and government-based. This multi-mode standardisation challenges the theoretical views on standardisation which predominantly focus on one of the modes. In this paper, we review the existing literatures on individual modes and on multi-mode standardisation. By recombining existing evidence, we generate new insights into multi-mode standardisation processes. These first insights relate to the contributions that each mode can make to such processes’ outcomes and suggest that their impact depends on factors, such as their initiation’s timing and the institutional context in which the standardisation process occurs. Moreover, we consider the conditions under which actors can launch each mode. Based on our observations, we formulate an agenda for future research to obtain a better understanding of multi-mode standardisation. We offer recommendations for industry actors, NGOs, researchers and policy makers involved in shaping technological and societal change.",

Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption). Appropriate changes are already being implemented in manufacturing industry, including new business models, new jobs and new skills. Considerable high-level planning around the world is in progress and is bringing about these changes; for example, there is the US ‘Advanced Manufacturing National Program’ (AMNP)’, the German ‘Industrie 4.0’ plan, the French plan ‘la nouvelle France industrielle’ and the UK Foresight publications on the ‘Future of Manufacturing’. All of these activities recognise the central part that humans will continue to play in the new manufacturing paradigms; however, they do not discuss many of the issues that systems ergonomics professionals acknowledge. This paper discusses a number of these issues, highlighting the need for some new thinking and knowledge capture by systems ergonomics professionals. Among these are ethical issues, job content and skills issues. Towards the end, there is a summary of knowledge extensions considered necessary in order that systems ergonomists can be fully effective in this new environment, together with suggestions for the means to acquire and disseminate the knowledge extensions.",

abstract = "Context
Service-oriented computing and context-aware computing are two consolidated paradigms that are changing the way of providing and consuming software services. Whilst service-oriented computing is based on service-oriented architectures for providing flexible software services, context-aware computing articulates different phases of a context life cycle for changing the behavior of such services. The synergy between both paradigms provides the context to this study.
Objective
This study analyzes the current state of the art of context models, specifically: (1) which are these proposals and how are they related; (2) what are their structural characteristics; (3) what context information is the most addressed; and (4) what are their most consolidated definitions. Given their dominance on the field, the study focuses on ontology-based approaches.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping by establishing a review protocol that integrates automatic and manual searches from different sources. We applied a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the papers to evaluate.
Results
Overall, 138 primary studies were selected to answer our research questions. These proposals were studied in depth by analyzing: 1) distribution along time and their relationships; 2) size correlated with the number of classes and levels of the context model, and coverage of the definitions provided as indicator of quality provided; 3) most addressed context information; 4) most consolidated definitions of context information.
Conclusions
The contribution of this survey is to make available a unified and consolidated body of knowledge on context for service-oriented computing that could be instantiated and used as starting point in a variety of use cases. This sweeping view on the anatomy of context models may help avoiding the postulation of new proposals not aligned with the current research.",

Furthermore, available systems are usually strongly technology-oriented and they neglect the user's satisfaction and the benefits’ analysis. In addition to this, modern systems impose the intelligent management of a huger amount of data, which needs to be properly coordinated to achieve higher performances and offer new energy-control services. This paper defines an information management model to improve device interoperability in smart homes. It allows selecting and classifying the devices, visualizing their data model, aggregating the necessary data according to the desired service functions, and finally defining a set of rules to coordinate device operations according to user preferences and external events. A case study focused on washing machines is presented to demonstrate the methodology implementation; it allows designing and developing an energy-control service for the selected device and optimizing its functions according to the users’ needs and preferences as well as the constraints of the use scenario. Finally, the benefits achieved with such a new service are evaluated in terms of energy consumption, costs reduction and user satisfaction in a simulated home environment that represents practical scenarios of use.",

Yet many countries' NIPs have resulted in tremendous societal benefit through both planned and unplanned action not associated with these goals. Socially important technology product platforms often are developed at facilities that are part of National Innovation Systems. Yet the policies that govern Social Entrepreneurial Action (SEA) at these facilities are unclear. If there is not a place for SEA in these facilities for technology transfer practice then there is cause for concern. Here we add to the growing literature on SEA by utilizing the case study method to investigate how SEA has been utilized by the US National Innovation Systems (NIS) for the benefit of society. We do this by investigating two cases which emphasize internal (corporate) and external SEA in a research facility within the US NIS. We demonstrate how a US national laboratory's external engagement of SEA led to one of the most important innovations of the last half of the 20th century – the Laminar Flow Clean Room. We also show how internal SEA led to the emergence of the National Institute for Nanotechnology Engineering (NINE). The “NINE program” created a pathway enabling the emergence of nascent policy makers, technologists and entrepreneurial professionals. We then provide a model for SEA at US national laboratories through technology able social innovators and identify a new type of internal and external social entrepreneur – the Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE).",

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”. The indices derived from the proposed approach are capable of uncovering the relationships between the individual technological sectors and provide numerical metrics to measure the presence of converging technologies.",

Among the new defined MAC protocols, Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME) represents the most suitable option for applications with time-varying requirements. In this paper, an analysis of the IEEE 802.15.4 DSME MAC protocol during network formation is presented. The goal is to study the protocol performance and propose solutions to reduce the network formation time, improving energy and resource efficiency. To carry out the performance evaluation, DSME has been fully implemented in Contiki OS, an actual operating system for sensor nodes. The study has highlighted issues and inefficiencies in the network formation process, allowing to consequently propose effective solutions. In particular, it is proposed a set of guidelines for DSME configuration to the original MAC protocol that are proved to increase significantly the network formation efficiency.",

In this article, we introduce a new framework to guide potential evolution of the building stock in the next century, based on greenhouse gas emissions as the common thread to investigate the potential implications of new design paradigms, innovative operational strategies, and disruptive technologies. This framework emphasizes integration of multidisciplinary knowledge, scalability for mainstream buildings, and proactive approaches considering constraints and unknowns.

The paper presents the bibliometric and thematic analysis of research papers from 2008 to 2016. This paper contributes in theorizing BDA capabilities in context of supply chain, and provides future direction of research in this field.",

These medical devices are surgically implanted into patient's bodies and wirelessly configured by prescribing physicians and healthcare professionals using external programmers. However, these devices are threatened by a set of lethal attacks, due to the use of vulnerable wireless communication and security protocols, and the lack of security protection mechanisms deployed on IMDs. In this paper, we propose a digital investigation system for the postmortem analysis of lethal attack scenarios on cardiac IMDs. After developing a set of techniques allowing the secure storage of digital evidence logs which track the executed sensitive events, we implement an in-depth security solution allowing the protection of cardiac IMDs. An inference system integrating a library of medical rules is proposed to automatically infer potential medical scenarios that caused the patient's death, or that created heart-related emergency situations (through the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia for example). A Model Checking based formal technique to reconstruct potential technical attack scenarios on a cardiac IMD, starting from the collected evidence, is also proposed. The results obtained by the two proposed reasoning techniques (i.e., the inference system and the Model Checking based algorithm) are correlated to prove whether a potential attack scenario is responsible of the occurrence of heart-related emergency situations or the death of a patient. Based on the proposed techniques, we design a decision-support system that reconciles in the same framework the medical and technical investigation aspects.",

The adoption of Product-Service Systems (PSS) strategies appears as a promising solution. However, practical application of PSS sustainable approaches is still limited. This may be associated to the fact that a PSS does not guarantee environmental improvements if it is not specifically designed with this purpose. PSS design process models can play a relevant role in supporting companies in designing sustainable PSS when they incorporate activities, methods and tools to approach the sustainability dimensions. Not only the process models, but also the intentions of practitioners and their awareness towards sustainability during the design of a PSS influence the dissemination of sustainable PSS. The objective of this work is to investigate whether the existent PSS design process models support the design of sustainable PSS and whether practitioners employ sustainability-related activities when designing PSS. Nine process models were analyzed and the perspective of practitioners about considering sustainability issues when designing PSS were captured. The collected data shows that only few of the analyzed process models actually propose activities, methods or tools to support a sustainable PSS design. This suggests an existing gap between literature and the practitioners’ expectations of PSS design process models. Moreover, those activities, methods and tools are mainly focused on eco-efficiency and the social dimension is generally not covered.",

To protect data security, users encrypt data with message-locked encryption (MLE) to enable deduplication over ciphertexts. However, existing secure deduplication schemes suffer from security weakness (i.e., brute-force attacks) and fail to support flexible access control. The process of chunk-level MLE key generation and sharing exists potential privacy issues and heavy computation consumption. We propose EDedup, a similarity-aware encrypted deduplication scheme that supports flexible access control with revocation. Specifically, EDedup groups files into segments and performs server-aided MLE at segment-level, which exploits similarity via a representative hash (e.g., the min-hash) to reduce computation consumption. This nevertheless faces a new attack that an attacker gets keys by guessing the representative hash. And hence EDedup combines source-based similar-segment detection and target-based duplicate-chunk checking to resist attacks and guarantee deduplication efficiency. Furthermore, EDedup generates message-derived file keys for duplicate files to manage metadata. EDedup encrypts file keys via proxy-based attribute-based encryption, which reduces metadata storage overheads and implements flexible access control with revocation. Evaluation results demonstrate that EDedup improves the speed of MLE up to 10.9X and 0.36X compared with DupLESS-chunk and SecDep respectively. EDedup reduces metadata storage overheads by 39.9%–65.7% relative to REED.",

This encompasses not just life at home but in particular the mobility of elderly people (e.g. when going for a walk or having sports) as well. Within this paper we will introduce a novel architecture for distributed AAL solutions whose design follows a modern Microservices approach by providing small core services instead of a monolithic application framework. The architecture comprises core services for sensor integration, and service discovery while supporting several communication models (periodic, sporadic, streaming). We extend the state-of-the-art by introducing a fault-tolerance model for our architecture on the basis of a fault-hypothesis describing the fault-containment regions (FCRs) with their respective failure modes and failure rates in order to support safety-critical AAL applications.",

Some of the most celebrated results such as the optimality of base-stock policies have been obtained under this assumption. Yet it is often the case in practice that the decision makers have incomplete or partial information about their inventory levels. The reasons for this are many: Inventory records or cash register information differ from actual inventory because of a variety of factors including transaction errors, theft, spoilage, misplacement, unobserved lost demands, and information delays. As a result, what are usually observed are some events or surrogate measures, called signals, related to the inventory level. These relationships can provide the distribution of current inventory levels. Therefore, the system state in the inventory control problems is not the current inventory level, but rather its distribution given the observed signals. Thus, the analysis for finding optimal production or ordering policies takes place generally in the space of probability distributions. The purpose of this paper is to review some recent developments in the analysis of inventory management problems with incomplete information.",

A significant problem arises from the need to determine fixed sequence partitions (windows) to overcome the inability of a single sample to provide adequate information about an activity; commonly overcome by using a fixed size sliding window over consecutive samples to extract information—either handcrafted or learned features—and predicting a single label for all the samples in the window. Two key issues arise from this approach: (i) the samples in one window may not always share the same label, a problem more significant for short duration activities such as gestures. We refer to this as the multi-class windows problem. (ii) the inferencing phase is constrained by the window size selected during training while the best window size is difficult to tune in practice. We propose an efficient method for predicting the label of each sample, which we call dense labelling, in a sequence of activity data of arbitrary length based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) design. In particular, our approach overcomes the problems posed by multi-class windows and fixed size sequence partitions imposed during training. Further, our network learns both features and the classifier automatically. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to outperform the state-of-the-arts in terms of sample-based classification and activity-based label misalignment measures on three challenging datasets: Opportunity, Hand Gesture, and our new dataset—an activity dataset we release based on a wearable sensor worn by hospitalised patients.",

For example, their network externalities are one of the distinct characteristics of social connections, while premium network services contribute to investment in network assets beyond a base level, resulting in extra capital stock. This multifaceted nature of the next generation Internet raises policy issues regarding network investment and net neutrality. This study aims at developing a dynamic model with a representative user whose preferences are differentiated by service types. The fraction of usage of social connections and the level of the extra capital stock are state variables representing system behavior. My analyses identify not only interior but also boundary equilibria under various scenarios about the relationships between the relative productivity and cost of social connectedness and premium network services. The policy implications from the analysis include the effects of rapid technological development on network obsolescence, which may tip the market in favor of social connections. Net neutrality may lead to unintended consequences though, due to its effects on the sources for network investment.",

abstract = "Exploring innovative cellular architectures to achieve enhanced system capacity and good coverage has become a critical issue towards realizing the next generation of wireless communications. In this context, this paper proposes a novel concept of Universal Intelligent Small Cell (UnISCell) for enabling the densification of the next generation of cellular networks. The proposed novel concept envisions an integrated platform of providing a strong linkage between different stakeholders such as street lighting networks, landline telephone networks and future wireless networks, and is universal in nature being independent of the operating frequency bands and traffic types. The main motivating factors for the proposed small cell concept are the need of public infrastructure re-engineering, and the recent advances in several enabling technologies. First, we highlight the main concepts of the proposed UnISCell platform. Subsequently, we present two deployment scenarios for the proposed UnISCell concept considering infrastructure sharing and service sharing as important aspects. We then describe the key future technologies for enabling the proposed UnISCell concept and present a use case example with the help of numerical results. Finally, we conclude this article by providing some interesting future recommendations.",

It can easily embrace all available and upcoming wireless technologies, while enforcing, at the same time, ubiquitous and secure applications in many domains, such as, e-government and public administration, intelligent transportation systems, public safety, social, health-care, educational, building and urban planning, environmental, and energy and water management applications. All the details of the proposed approach have been carefully described by means of pragmatical use-cases, such as the management of administrative procedures, the starting of a new business in a given country, the navigation assistance, the signaling of an urban accident aimed at improving the public safety, the reservation of a medical examination, the remote assistance of patients, and the management of waste in a city.

The current knowledge on success factors for service innovation, such as formalized new service development (NSD) processes, predominantly comes from studying large firms with a relatively stable resource base. However, this neglect situations in which organizations face severe resource constraints. This paper argues that under such constraints, a formalized new service development process could be counter-productive and a bricolage perspective might better explain service innovation in resource-constrained environments. In this conceptual paper, we propose that four critical bricolage capabilities (addressing resource scarcity actively, making do with what is available, improvising when recombining resources, and networking with external partners) influence service innovation outcomes. Empirical illustrations from five organizations substantiate our conceptual development. Our discussion leads to a framework and four testable propositions that can guide further service research.",

A Cross-Validated Bayes Classifier then evaluates real-value diagonal search data to improve the prediction rate. Finally, the MapReduce function on Bayes Classes provides efficient predictive analytics regarding Big Data.

As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets.",

We argue that the most dramatic consequence is not the possibilities created for companies but rather the challenges that emerge as a result of customer behaviour undergoing fundamental changes. Technology transformation has paved the way for empowered customers who are increasingly influencing businesses and markets, and the challenge for practitioners and researchers alike is to make sense of the role of these customers in such business environments. These developments have yielded a need to revise companies’ business models and to innovate new offerings. In scholarly research on marketing, this need has become evident and, beyond suggesting new concepts, completely new marketing management perspectives have been proposed, and each has its own core assumptions and focus. Broader views have emerged, and these stress the applicability of these perspectives not only to the top-level management of businesses but also to any non-commercial organisation. In this article, we reflect on the customer-dominant logic (CDL) of marketing, which stresses the customer's primary role in business. As such, CDL differs from approaches that focus on the provider's perspective. The CDL approach is an expression of the research ideals and goals that are based on the Nordic School of Service Management. We argue that CDL is well aligned with emerging challenges in most markets, both established and nascent, and that it is more managerially relevant than many other perspectives. This is also in line with the recent calls for a soul of relevance for European management research (Chia, 2014; Hernes, 2014).",

Several emerging applications require that the sensors conform to curved 3-D surfaces and provide an improved spatial resolution through miniaturized dimensions. The proliferation of sensor applications also requires that the environmental impact from their manufacturing be minimized. This paper demonstrates and characterizes interdigitated capacitive touch sensors manufactured using an Aerosol Jet based additive technique that reduces waste and minimizes the use of harmful chemicals. The sensors are manufactured with the capacitive elements at an in-plane length scale of about 50μm by 1.5–5mm, a thickness of 0.5μm, and a native capacitance of a 1–5pF. The sensor capacitance variation is within 8% over multiple samples, establishing the repeatability of the Aerosol Jet method. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to characterize the sensor electrodes. 3-D electromagnetic simulations are carried out to predict the capacitance of the printed sensors and the electric field distribution. The simulations show a reasonable agreement with the experimental values of the sensors’ native capacitance (within 12.5%). The model shows the native capacitance to be relatively insensitive to the thickness of the sensor electrodes, allowing touch sensors to be fabricated with reduced material usage and cost. The model is further used to establish the important sensor dimensions governing its electrical performance. Lastly, electromagnetic field distribution predicted by the model is used to establish the physical range of the touch action to be about a millimeter out of the plane of the sensors for the geometries considered in the current work.",

abstract = "Human motion energy harvesting as an alternative to battery powering in body worn and implanted devices is challenging during prolonged periods of inactivity. Even a buffer energy storage system will run out of power eventually if there is no external acceleration to the harvester. This paper presents a method to actuate the rotor inside a previously presented rotational piezoelectric energy harvester wirelessly via a magnetic reluctance coupling to an external driving rotor with one or more permanent magnet stacks attached. This makes it possible to recharge a battery or super-capacitor even if a patient is not moving. The use of a permanent magnet coupling has potential advantages compared to traditional inductive or ultrasonic methods, e.g. in terms of tissue damage and transmission depth. Simulation results show the achievable coupling torque for different configurations of magnet geometries and relative positions between the driving magnet stack(s) and the harvester. It is shown that using a single magnet stack yields better results than using two diametrically opposite stacks. Measurements are performed with different magnets, driving frequencies and orientations of the harvester. The results are discussed and successful energy transfer was achieved regardless of the orientation of the device with respect to gravity, which is desirable for real world applications. Lateral misalignment between the harvester and the driving magnet can also be overcome. The largest distance of power transfer reached was 32mm with the largest magnets tested, and the optimal power output into a resistive load was over 100μW at a frequency of 25Hz. The functional volume of the harvester is 1.85cm3 – similar to the size of a wristwatch.",

abstract = "An enormous effort has been made during the recent years towards the recognition of human activity based on wearable sensors. Despite the wide variety of proposed systems, most existing solutions have in common to solely operate on predefined settings and constrained sensor setups. Real-world activity recognition applications and users rather demand more flexible sensor configurations dealing with potential adverse situations such as defective or missing sensors. In order to provide interoperability and reconfigurability, heterogeneous sensors used in wearable activity recognition systems must be fairly abstracted from the actual underlying network infrastructure. This work presents MIMU-Wear, an extensible ontology that comprehensively describes wearable sensor platforms consisting of mainstream magnetic and inertial measurement units (MIMUs). MIMU-Wear describes the capabilities of MIMUs such as their measurement properties and the characteristics of wearable sensor platforms including their on-body location. A novel method to select an adequate replacement for a given anomalous or nonrecoverable sensor is also presented in this work. The proposed sensor selection method is based on the MIMU-Wear Ontology and builds on a set of heuristic rules to infer the candidate replacement sensors under different conditions. Then, queries are iteratively posed to select the most appropriate MIMU sensor for the replacement of the defective one. An exemplary application scenario is used to illustrate some of the potential of MIMU-Wear for supporting seamless operation of wearable activity recognition systems.",

Based on a literature review, a creative idea generation process was developed; it consists of four successive phases (Future envision, Opportunity identification and analysis, Idea generation, and Idea expansion) and one supportive phase (Ideation control). From various research fields, 70 idea generation techniques were collected and classified into phases of the process. To identify implicit and latent opportunities, the future envision method was developed based on a factor combination approach. In assessments by four experts in IT, the ideas generated by the UX-driven idea generation methodology got higher scores than brainstorming approach in novelty and relevance, but not in feasibility. The effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction was greater in the group who used the UX-driven idea generation methodology. Relevance to industry: The idea generation methodology suggested in this study can help indusial designers such as novice designers, analytical individuals as well as intuitive individuals who adhere to initial ideas.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Attribute Based Encryption Scheme (LABE) for mobile cloud-assisted CPS based on a proxy service architecture and a new ciphertext policy ABE. In particular, mobile devices will solely perform symmetric encryption by joining authentication and encryption proxy services encapsulated in RESTful. Encryption shall not need pairing and then ciphertext can be decrypted with one pairing. Security analysis shows that the proposed LABE is secure with fine grained access control and users revocation capability. The computation complexity shows that the proposed scheme imposes low overhead on mobile devices and performs very well in mobile cloud-assisted CPS.",

Hence, software adaptor technologies such as the ATLAS Transformation Language (ATL) are gaining momentum due to the potential to define and regulate peer-to-peer communication among networks of enterprise systems. At present, ATL is the de facto standard for transformations within the framework of model-driven interoperability (MDI), nonetheless it lacks the dynamism required to streamline complex systems, which demand adaptors to be frequently redesigned whenever information models change. This paper presents a novel solution, which aims to reduce the setbacks that arise from this lack of dynamism.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose energy efficient Information Piece Delivery (IPD) through Nano Servers (NSs) in a vehicular network. Information pieces may contain any data that needs to be communicated to a vehicle. The available power (renewable or non-renewable) for a NS is variable. As a result, the service rate of a NS varies linearly with the available energy within a given range. Our proposed system therefore exhibits energy aware rate adaptation (RA), which uses variable transmission energy. We have also developed another transmission energy saving method for comparison, where sleep cycles (SC) are employed. Both methods are compared against an acceptable download time. To reduce the operational energy, we first optimise the locations of the NSs by developing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which takes into account the hourly variation of the traffic. The model is validated through a Genetic Algorithm (GA1). Furthermore, to reduce the gross delay over the entire vehicular network, the available renewable energy (wind farm) is optimally allocated to each NS according to piece demand. This, in turn, also reduces the network carbon footprint. A Genetic Algorithm (GA2) is also developed to validate the MILP results associated with this system. Through transmission energy savings, RA and SC further reduce the NSs energy consumption by 19% and 18% respectively, however at the expense of higher download time. MILP model 4 (with RA) and model 5 (with SC) reduced the delay by 81% and 83% respectively, while minimising the carbon footprint by 96% and 98% respectively, compared to the initial MILP model.",

However, before applying the classification algorithms, the vast majority of current studies extract hand-engineered features that are assumed to detect local patterns in the time series. Therefore, the efficiency and precision of these classification approaches are heavily dependent on the quality of variables defined by domain experts. Recent improvements in the deep learning domain offer opportunities to avoid such an intensive hand-crafted feature engineering which is particularly important for managing the processes based on time-series data obtained from various sensor networks. In our paper, we propose a framework to extract the features in an unsupervised (or self-supervised) manner using deep learning, particularly stacked LSTM Autoencoder Networks. The compressed representation of the time-series data obtained from LSTM Autoencoders are then provided to Deep Feedforward Neural Networks for classification. We apply the proposed framework on sensor time series data from the process industry to detect the quality of the semi-finished products and accordingly predict the next production process step. To validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we used real-world data from the steel industry.",

Findings of the exploratory study, supported by extant literature on technology acceptance, service quality and trusting belief, form the basis for the proposed research model which is empirically tested with 328 respondents from 77 villages in 12 districts in India using Partial Least Square (PLS) technique with hierarchical modelling. Findings of the study suggest that the behaviour of the intermediaries manning these outlets, reliability of the outlet and facilities available at the outlet have significant effect on the service quality of the outlet, which in turn, has a positive effect on citizens' intention for availing e-Government services. Other factors of adoption that are identified to be significant are ease of obtaining service, usefulness of the outlet and positive word-of-mouth among the user community.",

The project tackles two main challenges:-Reduction of fraud by demonstrating the use of an ICT – enhanced European Disable Badge for public parking, both on the basis of physical – i.e. smartcards – and virtual access right tokens – i.e. e-access through mobile devices.-Proposal of specific multimodal navigation solutions for elderly and disabled people, using opendata hubs and preexisting toolsets that will be populated and exploited with specific information – e.g. elevators located near sub-way stations. An additional challenge is the instantiation of a proven methodology for data privacy preservation and authentication of users. SIMON builds on existing mobility services, using the current infrastructure of the cities, and adds the required integration work to provide a seamless services integration layer which can be instantiated in different cities according to the specific context and the services available. Thus, from an ICT point of view, SIMON services are adaptable to heterogeneous environment, with different capabilities. The SIMON system platform supports some services that feed different applications, all of them accessible through different mobile devices. A backoffice also provides the access through a web application to let the public authority manage the whole system.",

The lack of interoperability hampers the integration and usage of these devices and services. Furthermore, one objective in the field of Ambient Intelligence and Human Machine Interaction is the adaption of assistive services to the user 5. This is deeply rooted in the idea that the usage of ambient technologies still means a barrier for elderly and impaired people and prevents them to trust and use these technologies. But as these technologies aim at supporting and not restricting elderly and impaired people, a methodology is needed to overcome the barrier of using ambient assistive technologies. In this paper, we present an approach to a) enable a simplified integration of heterogeneous devices and services by the Web of Things recommendation and b) a lightweight AAL ontology together with a rule-based engine called Sherlock in order to demonstrate the advantages in representing and linking user intentions to device capabilities using Semantic Web technologies. Moreover, we show how this semantic representation in the context-aware Sherlock engine is used to derive user intentions by recognising device events. The practical applicability of the presented approach is demonstrated in a real-world use case from the AICASys project1.1See: http://www.mtidw.de/ueberblick-bekanntmachungen/ALS/aicasys",

However, information security for both private and business aspects is important. Experts believe that technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information. Users' behaviour should be considered as an important factor in this domain. The Internet is a huge network with great potential for information security breaches. Hackers use different methods to change confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of information in line with their benefits, while users intentionally or through negligence are a great threat for information security. Sharing their account information, downloading any software from the Internet, writing passwords on sticky paper, and using social security numbers as a username or password are examples of their mistakes. Users' negligence, ignorance, lack of awareness, mischievous, apathy and resistance are usually the reasons for security breaches. Users' poor information security behaviour is the main problem in this domain and the presented model endeavours to reduce the risk of users' behaviour in this realm. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that Information Security Awareness, Information Security Organization Policy, Information Security Experience and Involvement, Attitude towards information security, Subjective Norms, Threat Appraisal, and Information Security Self-efficacy have a positive effect on users' behaviour. However, Perceived Behavioural Control does not affect their behaviour significantly.

It enables accurate real-time control of every asset, and thus improves the management efficiency and effectiveness.

After that, the framework of cloud asset-enabled workflow management is built, in which cloud asset could be easily found and dynamically invoked by different workflows. Finally, a demonstrative case is provided to verify the effectiveness of cloud asset.",

Amid the numerous advances related to this development, a strategic and significant component is demand side management (DSM).

Based on the importance and their frequency of appearance, ten most prominent codes were identified, and the strength of their interrelationships is presented on a multilevel scale with three different ranks. One of the major and important outcomes of this research is that, with the help of the proposed conceptual framework, a proper implementation framework can be built, which can be used for developing most appropriate IBDRP for any retail electricity market.",

abstract = "Background
Cyber-foraging architectural tactics are used to build mobile applications that leverage proximate, intermediate cloud surrogates for computation offload and data staging. Compared to direct access to cloud resources, the use of intermediate surrogates improves system qualities such as response time, energy efficiency, and resilience. However, the state-of-the-art mostly focuses on introducing new architectural tactics rather than quantitatively comparing the existing tactics, which can help software architects and software engineers with new insights on each tactic.
Aim
Our work aims at empirically evaluating the architectural tactics for surrogate provisioning, specifically with respect to resilience and energy efficiency.
Method
We follow a systematic experimentation framework to collect relevant data on Static Surrogate Provisioning and Dynamic Surrogate Provisioning tactics. Our experimentation approach can be reused for validation of other cyber-foraging tactics. We perform statistical analysis to support our hypotheses, as compared to baseline measurements with no cyber-foraging tactics deployed.
Results
Our findings show that Static Surrogate Provisioning tactics provide higher resilience than Dynamic Surrogate Provisioning tactics for runtime environmental changes. Both surrogate provisioning tactics perform with no significant difference with respect to their energy efficiency. We observe that the overhead of the runtime optimization algorithm is similar for both tactic types.
Conclusions
The presented quantitative evidence on the impact of different tactics empowers software architects and software engineers with the ability to make more conscious design decisions. This contribution, as a starting point, emphasizes the use of quantifiable metrics to make better-informed trade-offs between desired quality attributes. Our next step is to focus on the impact of runtime programmable infrastructure on the quality of cyber-foraging systems.",

abstract = "Cloud computing as a new internet-based computing model provides different resources as a service dynamically. Today, cloud computing is actually one of the main improvements in the computing procedure. However, by raising user interactions, the complexity of cloud processes is increasing with the advancement of technology. To evaluate the cloud computing challenges, the simulation experiments just satisfy the non-functional properties with a limited majority in forms of QoS factors. In addition, using simulation approaches have not been sufficient for developed complex cloud services that omit some critical test cases in the state space of the model. On the other hand, formal verification is an essential section in the complex information systems development that satisfies both functional and non-functional properties. Therefore, it is essential that the cloud systems use formal verification approaches for increasing the correctness of the system quality in all of the state space of the model. Despite the importance of the formal verification approaches in the cloud environments, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any systematic, comprehensive and detailed survey and review in the field of formal verification approaches and standards in the cloud computing. This paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to examine the current technical studies (published between 2011 and July 2017) in formal verification of the cloud computing. Also, this paper categorizes the formal verification approaches in three classic fields: specification and process algebra, model checking, and theorem proving. The verification approaches are compared with each other according to some technical properties such as specification methods, modeling approaches, verification tools and verification methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each selected study as well as some hints are discussed for solving their problems. The brief contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) providing a comprehensive literature review of the formal verification approaches in the cloud computing, (2) designing a technical taxonomy for the verification approaches in various modeling and specification methods, (3) presenting a technical analysis and comparison for the main challenges of the formal verification in the cloud and (4) highlighting the future open issues in the recent topics.",

In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.",

abstract = "Environmentally friendly and flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) have attracted considerable interest for use in autonomous micro-/nano-systems, wearable electronics, and implantable biomedical devices. Herein, a flexible, lead-free, solution-processable and efficient PENG is demonstrated, based on a highly piezoelectric nanocomposite thin film of barium titanate nanoparticles (BT NPs) embedded into a highly crystalline polyvinylidene fluoride–trifluoroethylene (P(VDF–TrFE)) polymer for charge storage. The nanocomposite PENG (nc-PENG) with high loading of BT NPs up to 40wt% in the nanocomposite can produce output voltage as high as 9.8V and output power density of 13.5µW/cm2 under cyclic bending, comparable to the output of conventional inorganic polycrystalline lead zirconate titanate PENGs. The high performance of these nc-PENGs is primarily attributed to the very high effective piezoelectricity of the highly crystalline P(VDF-TrFE), strengthened by the BT NPs. The nc-PENG was also demonstrated to harvest biomechanical energy from simple body movements and store the generated electricity during mechanical and biomechanical motions in a rechargeable microbattery.",

To consider them as users and facilitators of assistive technology has become even more important, since new capacities of technology and comprehensive visions of robotics have started to change the relation between care workers and technology significantly. In Berlin, Germany, we conducted a series of qualitative interviews with care professionals who work in care services or advise on technical aids for the elderly. Our main focus was on the experiences of the care professionals with assistive technology: on the kind of assistive technology they use, the benefits and difficulties they experience using technology, the visions they have etc. We found out that care professionals perceived technology to be in competition with important aspects of care. The results reflect the changing relation between care workers and assistive technology.",

This has been no less true of ambient intelligence (AmI), which may be embedded everywhere in the not so distant future. Most of the scenarios developed by AmI enthusiasts have been rather ‘sunny’, showing how the new technologies promise to make our lives more efficient, enjoyable, productive, enriching. A European project, called Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence (SWAMI), deliberately developed ‘dark scenarios’ to highlight the threats to privacy, identity, trust, security and inclusiveness posed by the new technologies. The SWAMI consortium also developed a methodological structure for deconstructing and analysing the dark scenarios. This paper takes that approach a step further by applying it to a cultural artefact, partly to test the validity, utility, applicability of the SWAMI methodology to a scenario not constructed by the consortium and partly to show how some cultural artefacts can be regarded as scenarios in their own right as well as warnings about future technologies. The cultural artefact chosen here was the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report, because it features so many AmI technologies and draws attention to the issues that have been the focus of the SWAMI project.",

The resulting system uses practical capacity to compute rates and is based on a hybrid of machining and labor times. The most innovative aspect is the use of real-time data on machine times in manufacturing, in the context of a large number and frequently changing products. The study also helps to better understand the limitations of time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), and it highlights the role of “data discovery” for the design of costing systems.",

RSW process and data challenges including inconsistency often hinder the utilization of the data-driven weldability prediction. In this paper, we apply a decision tree algorithm on the RSW dataset collected from an automotive OEM to plot regression trees and to extract decision rules for the weld nugget width prediction. With three RSW test datasets, we conclude that the decision trees help in predicting the nugget width and in determining the impact of design and process parameters to the nugget width response variable.",

Big Data is a data analysis methodology enables by recent advances in information and communications technology. However, big data analysis requires a huge amount of computing resources making adoption costs of big data technology is not affordable for many small to medium enterprises. In this paper, we outline the the benefits and challenges involved in deploying big data analytics through cloud computing. We argue that cloud computing can support the storage and computing requirements of big data analytics. We discuss how the consolidation of these two dominant technologies can enhance the process of big data mining enabling businesses to improve decision-making processes.

Its success builds on the ability of MS to determine molecular weights of analytes, and elucidate their structures. However, sample handling prior to MS requires a lot of attention and labor. In this work we were aiming to automate processing samples for MS so that analyses could be conducted without much supervision of experienced analysts. The goal of this study was to develop a robotics and information technology-oriented platform that could control the whole analysis process including sample delivery, reaction-based assay, data acquisition, and interaction with the analyst. The proposed platform incorporates a robotic arm for handling sample vials delivered to the laboratory, and several auxiliary devices which facilitate and secure the analysis process. They include: multi-relay board, infrared sensors, photo-interrupters, gyroscopes, force sensors, fingerprint scanner, barcode scanner, touch screen panel, and internet interface. The control of all the building blocks is achieved through implementation of open-source electronics (Arduino), and enabled by custom-written programs in C language. The advantages of the proposed system include: low cost, simplicity, small size, as well as facile automation of sample delivery and processing without the intervention of the analyst. It is envisaged that this simple robotic system may be the forerunner of automated laboratories dedicated to mass spectrometric analysis of biological samples.",

This is all the more true in the manufacturing, and particularly in the maintenance sector where quality of enterprise maintenance services are closely linked to the quality of maintenance data reporting procedures. If quality of the reported data is too low, it can results in wrong decision-making and loss of money. Furthermore, various maintenance experts are involved and directly concerned about the quality of enterprises’ daily maintenance data reporting (e.g., maintenance planners, plant managers...), each one having specific needs and responsibilities. To address this Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, and since data quality is hardly considered in existing expert maintenance systems, this paper develops a maintenance reporting quality assessment (MRQA) dashboard that enables any company stakeholder to easily – and in real-time – assess/rank company branch offices in terms of maintenance reporting quality. From a theoretical standpoint, AHP is used to integrate various data quality dimensions as well as expert preferences. A use case describes how the proposed MRQA dashboard is being used by a Finnish multinational equipment manufacturer to assess and enhance reporting practices in a specific or a group of branch offices.",

However, the different solutions presented in this survey are not only intended to mechanisms dedicated to fault tolerance, but they also include all the mechanisms allowing the prevention of fault occurrence such as energy aware routing and data aggregation and compression. Besides the classification of fault tolerance mechanisms according to the tasks they target (data management, flow management), we also propose a new classification based on the network size, since the performance of the majority mechanisms depends on the size in terms of geographical area and number of nodes. Thus, a well performing protocol conceived for small networks may be inadequate for large networks and vice versa.",

In addition, we provide a state-of-the-art survey of ULD methods and apply our taxonomy to map these methods. Mapping contributes to gap analysis for existing ULDs and also validates the applicability and accuracy of the taxonomy. Using this systematic approach, the features and characteristics of the current ULD methods are identified (i.e., equipment and algorithms). Next, the weaknesses and advantages of these methods are analyzed utilizing ten important evaluation metrics.

This article gives overview and discussion about the state-of-the-art of the data mining and data fusion techniques designed for the WSNs. It discusses how these techniques can prepare the sensor data inside the network (in-network) before any further processing as big data. This is very important for both of the WSNs and the big data framework. For the WSNs, the in-network pre-processing techniques could lead to saving in their limited resources. For the big data side, receiving a clean, non-redundant and relevant data would reduce the excessive data volume, thus an overload reduction will be obtained at the big data processing platforms and the discovery of values from these data will be accelerated.",

In addition to the prior disaster recovery use case, we apply Newt to the orchestration of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet by distributing the actors across a wireless network and have actors converse their lines as decentralized messages of communication between one actor and another as the play progresses. We construct and analyze conversational graph models for the Hamlet workflow by comparing an a priori baseline model and a post facto estimate resulting from measurements of network conversational adjacencies during the execution of the workflow.",

abstract = "A scalable medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for machine-type devices to access the channel simultaneously in a machine-to-machine (M2M) network. There can be two types of scenarios in an M2M network. First, where the M2M devices communicate with the base station one-by-one, and second, where the M2M devices directly communicate with each other within a group or cluster without any human intervention (Inter-M2M communication). Considering the second type of scenario, the devices can use basic contention or reservation-based MAC protocols. But with such a large number of M2M devices, adaptability, and scalability become bottlenecks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel scalable hybrid-MAC protocol, which combines the benefits of both contention-based and reservation-based medium access schemes. We assume that the contention and reservation portion of M2M devices is a frame structure, which mainly has two parts: contention interval (CI) and data transmission interval (DTI). The devices contend for the channel access during CI. After contention, the successful devices win time-slots and transmit data packets during DTI. In our proposed hybrid-MAC scheme, each M2M device is IEEE 802.11 DCF enabled, and within each time slot during DTI, the devices share data with each other. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed hybrid-MAC protocol performs better than slotted-ALOHA, p-persistent CSMA, and TDMA in terms of aggregate throughput, average transmission delay, channel utility, and energy consumption.",

It allows the increasing number of mobile phone users to share local knowledge acquired by their sensor-enhanced devices. Social sensors, social sensor receiver platform, and mobile crowd sensing paradigm compose a process by which physical sensors present in mobile devices such as GPS are used to infer social relationships and human activities. In this survey, we review the mobile crowd sensing applications on social sensors based on social sensor receiver platform (e.g., Weibo and Twitter) from three categories: public security, smart city, and location based services. Most applications adopted in current works fit in one of these categories. Existing works on applications of mobile crowd sensing on social sensors are collected and studied.

Primarily of concern is how to ensure anonymity and privacy within these methodologies, and further the related issue of how to incentivize participants and remove barriers/concerns over participation. To address these concerns, in this paper we introduce a novel system to capture aggregate population health research data via utilizing smartphone capabilities while fully maintaining the anonymity and privacy of each individual contributing such data. A key and novel capability of this system is the support for customizable data collection; without the need to know specific details about an individual. The customized collection rules can be deployed on the local device based on detailed local data, and the resultant collection can be measured by the anonymous data collection network. In this paper we provide a conceptual architecture and describe a method for local processing of aggregate e-Research health data utilizing adaptive privacy thresholds to create a multi-party flexible approach to participatory data submission to support this novel health e-Research capability.",

Traditional cryptographic schemes such as key establishment schemes are not practical for deployment on the (resource-constrained) wearable devices, due to the limitations in their computational capabilities (e.g. limited battery life). Thus, in this study, we propose a lightweight and real-time key establishment scheme for wearable devices by leveraging the integrated accelerometer. Specifically, we introduce a novel way for users to initialize a shared key using random shakes/movements on their wearable devices. Construction of the real-time key is based on the users’ motion (e.g. walking), which does not require the data source for key construction in different devices worn by the same user to be matching. To address the known limitations on the regularity and predictability of gait, we propose a new quantization method to select data that involve noise and uncertain factors when generating secure random number. This enhances the security of the derived key. Our evaluations demonstrate that the matching rate of the shake-to-generate secret key is up to 91.00% and the corresponding generation rate is 2.027 bit/s, and devices worn on human participant’s chest, waist, wrist and carried in the participant’s pocket can generate 4.405, 4.089, 6.089 and 3.204 bits random number per second for key generation, respectively.",

With a CPS, a user’s (elderly person’s) interactions with smart home appliances are sensed, collected, and shared in physical spaces. This interaction is then delivered to cyberspaces for processing in order to monitor energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient cyber–physical smart home system for monitoring the elderly that uses the potential of cloud computing and big data technologies. Given that an elderly person may need assistance with the complex activities of maintaining energy efficiency, a smart multimedia-enabled middleware assistant is proposed that enables him/her to observe different energy-efficient processes, control smart home appliances through gestures, receive notifications regarding appliance statuses, and share multimedia messages with a community of interest. For data processing, robust and low-dimensional discriminative features are extracted in a server from the data available via sensors and multimedia. Events are also automatically classified in the server to assist caregiver decision-making. To save energy, an automatic switch on/off control system using speech or gesture is developed. Keywords are detected from the speech and used as control commands. Experimental results show the encouraging potential of deploying this framework at a large scale.",

However, for many DTN applications such as distributing commercial content, targeting the best performance for only one index and neglecting the others is insufficient. A more practical solution would be to strike a balance between multiple of those performance indices. This paper introduces a Gain-aware Dissemination Protocol (GDP) which attempts to reach the maximum economic gain of content delivery by maintaining a balance between the value achieved via message delivery and the involved forwarding costs given out as user rebates. Economic gain from disseminating content is defined as the generated value upon content delivery minus its forwarding costs. The key concept behind the proposed protocol is to adaptively balance between dissemination latency and forwarding costs in order to maximize the economic gain. Using the DTN simulation software ONE, we characterize the GDP protocol with varying mobility models, content sources, and content generation times.",

Hadoop provides a highly feasible solution for building big data analytics platforms. However, defects of Hadoop are also exposed in many aspects including data management, resource management, scheduling policies, etc. These issues usually cause high energy consumption when running MapReduce jobs in Hadoop clusters. In this paper, we review the studies on improving energy efficiency of Hadoop clusters and summarize them in five categories including the energy-aware cluster node management, energy-aware data management, energy-aware resource allocation, energy-aware task scheduling and other energy-saving schemes. For each category, we briefly illustrate its rationale and comparatively analyze the relevant works regarding their advantages and limitations. Moreover, we present our insights and figure out possible research directions including energy-efficient cluster partitioning, data-oriented resource classification and provisioning, resource provisioning based on optimal utilization, EE and locality aware task scheduling, optimizing job profiling with machine learning, elastic power-saving Hadoop with containerization and efficient big data analytics on Hadoop. On one hand, the summary of studies on energy-efficient Hadoop presented in this paper provides useful guidance for the developers and users to better utilize Hadoop.

Indeed, today the smart city domain is being characterized by an emerging market that provides novel solutions for cyber-physical integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that attempts to clarify the domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing network of city alliances, forums and market places that aim to bring together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to define a common urban future; and a promising international network of scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a “common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts and leaves out real community problems. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative international city cases that claim to be smart. The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials. The outcomes distinguish utopia from reality, introduce a pool of evidence that can justify whether a city can claim to be smart and depict a brief view of the future smart city.",

The aim of the study was to examine the students perceptions of the long-term effectiveness of the English National Board (ENB) 870 course (Understanding and Application of Research). Method. Both quantitative and qualitative strategies examined four objectives focusing on: research utilisation, usefulness of the course in the “real world”, factors affecting research use and student support. A total sample comprised all 315 students from 1995 to 1998. Data were collected by postal questionnaires and by two focus group interviews. The responding sample of nurses, midwives and health visitors, all with a minimum of one years practice since completing the course totaled 145, achieving a response rate of 45%. Results. Evidence identified that practitioners were using research at a variety of levels to inform everyday practice. The skills developed in the course had transferred well to real life practice and a critical, confident, proactive approach within and across professional boundaries was demonstrated. A generally supportive culture was identified in the workplace but a lack of time and staff had prevented optimum utilisation of the new skills. A much more positive approach to research-based care was reported and many respondents stated that they had become more autonomous, accountable and better practitioners.",

abstract = "As the internet’s footprint continues to expand, cybersecurity is becoming a major concern for both governments and the private sector. One such cybersecurity issue relates to data integrity attacks. This paper focuses on the power industry, where the forecasting processes rely heavily on the quality of the data. Data integrity attacks are expected to harm the performances of forecasting systems, which will have a major impact on both the financial bottom line of power companies and the resilience of power grids. This paper reveals the effect of data integrity attacks on the accuracy of four representative load forecasting models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy interaction regression). We begin by simulating some data integrity attacks through the random injection of some multipliers that follow a normal or uniform distribution into the load series. Then, the four aforementioned load forecasting models are used to generate one-year-ahead ex post point forecasts in order to provide a comparison of their forecast errors. The results show that the support vector regression model is most robust, followed closely by the multiple linear regression model, while the fuzzy interaction regression model is the least robust of the four. Nevertheless, all four models fail to provide satisfying forecasts when the scale of the data integrity attacks becomes large. This presents a serious challenge to both load forecasters and the broader forecasting community: the generation of accurate forecasts under data integrity attacks. We construct our case study using the publicly-available data from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012. At the end, we also offer an overview of potential research topics for future studies.",

However, the number of single-person households has recently shown an exponential increase. At the same time, the smart home technology has been growing in order to provide at-home rest to individuals. In this situation, a home's role as a social space is diluted, and many people cannot receive the social support they need at home. In this study, we introduce the concept of social connectedness for the interaction between users and smart home devices. It can be divided into two types. One is the Inner Social Connectedness (ISC) that is generated through connections between the user and the devices in their smart home. The other is the Outer Social Connectedness (OSC) that is generated through connections between the user and the smart home devices in other people's houses. We also introduce two types of interaction. One is the unmediated interaction, in which users interact with each device and the individual device reveals its presence. The other one is the mediated interaction, in which users interact with a single agent that represents various smart home devices. In order to investigate the impact of both inner/outer social connectedness and mediated/unmediated interaction types, we conducted a controlled experiment using a prototype smart home system. The results indicate that both types of social connectedness increase the user's perceived social support. In terms of the effects of social connectedness and each integration type, unmediated interaction was found to be more effective with inner social connectedness, whereas mediated interaction was more effective with outer social connectedness. Furthermore, perceived social support increased companionship with smart home devices. The findings of this study will help design interaction methods between users and objects in smart homes in the future.",

This implies developing and keeping a record of the product’s materials and components, its physical state throughout the supply chain, the product’s forward movement to the user-customer, customer’s experience of the product, and the reverse logistics and reuse or termination of the product. The aim of visibility is to foster planning, control and agility of operations associated with the product and to improve customer experience of the product. “Tracking” is the term often used to describe the determination of the identity and state of a product in the forward direction (from manufacturing to the end user), while “tracing” is used to infer the product’s path and history from downstream to upstream of the supply chain. In recent times there has been an upsurge of academic and commercial interest in product visibility. This interest has translated into numerous architectures, technologies and software for product visibility, both at the atomic (item) and composite (or aggregate) levels. Based on an extensive content analysis of academic and trade literature, including websites and documents of vendors and users of the technologies, this paper captures, analyses, compares and contrasts the design choices, essence, results and current and potential future impacts of some of the recent developments. The study also used survey by questionnaire across industries to assess user requirements of tracking and tracing systems and structures.

abstract = "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one of the most important technologies in this century. As sensor nodes have limited energy resources, designing energy-efficient routing algorithms for WSNs has become the research focus. And because WSNs routing for maximizing the network lifetime is a NP-hard problem, many researchers try to optimize it with meta-heuristics. However, due to the uncertain variable number and strong constraints of WSNs routing problem, most meta-heuristics are inappropriate in designing routing algorithms for WSNs. This paper proposes an Improved Harmony Search Based Energy Efficient Routing Algorithm (IHSBEER) for WSNs, which is based on harmony search (HS) algorithm (a meta-heuristic). To address the WSNs routing problem with HS algorithm, several key improvements have been put forward: First of all, the encoding of harmony memory has been improved based on the characteristics of routing in WSNs. Secondly, the improvisation of a new harmony has also been improved. We have introduced dynamic adaptation for the parameter HMCR to avoid the prematurity in early generations and strengthen its local search ability in late generations. Meanwhile, the adjustment process of HS algorithm has been discarded to make the proposed routing algorithm containing less parameters. Thirdly, an effective local search strategy is proposed to enhance the local search ability, so as to improve the convergence speed and the accuracy of routing algorithm. In addition, an objective function model that considers both the energy consumption and the length of path is developed. The detailed descriptions and performance test results of the proposed approach are included. The experimental results clearly show the advantages of the proposed routing algorithm for WSNs.",

In these highly fluid operational environments, involving information providers and consumers of various degrees of trust and intentions, information transformation, such as obfuscation, is used to manage the inferences that could be made to protect providers from misuses of the information they share, while still providing benefits to their information consumers. In this paper, we develop the initial principles for relating to inference management and the role that trust and obfuscation plays in it within the context of this emerging breed of applications. We start by extending the definitions of trust and obfuscation into this emerging application space. We, then, highlight their role as we move from the tightly-coupled to loosely-coupled sensory-inference systems and describe how quality, value and risk of information relate in collaborative and adversarial systems. Next, we discuss quality distortion illustrated through a human activity recognition sensory system. We then present a system architecture to support an inference firewall capability in a publish/subscribe system for sensory information and conclude with a discussion and closing remarks.",

abstract = "Context
As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine – Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain.
Objective
We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b) runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c) the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware.
Method
Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using appropriate experimentation.
Results
Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation selection.
Conclusion
The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be negligible depending on the domain.",

In smart city, people can interact directly with the community and the infrastructure at anytime and anywhere, where GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) is an important network infrastructure for smart city. Recently, Gope and Hwang proposed an efficient authentication scheme for GLOMONET. However, we find their scheme lacks session key update and wrong password detection mechanisms, and vulnerable to denial-of-service attack. Besides, the session key can be known by HA (home agent), and perfect forward secrecy cannot be ensured. Furthermore, in their scheme, HA has to take heavy secret key management work. Based on previous work, this paper first summarizes the security and function requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment. Later, this paper proposed a robust biometrics based three-factor authentication scheme for GLOMONET in smart city. Security features of the proposed scheme are analyzed in detail, and comparisons of our scheme with other related schemes are illustrated. Analysis and comparison results show that our scheme meets the preconcerted security requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment, and it is robust for GLOMONET in smart city environments with higher security requirements.",

As a result, the information resources can be taken full advantage of so as to help miners to improve their safety condition, which are not just accessible to the management staff. However, there is not a detailed discussion or an in-depth research on the implementation of service system at present. In order to bridge the gap between the theory and the practice in the field, three critical problems need to be solved: (1) How to model the served miners’ context? (2) How to provide the information services to meet miners’ customized demands? (3) How to verify the availability of service invocation? According to the characteristics and practical needs of coal mine, this paper first proposes the Coal Mine Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (CMSSN) to build miner's context model, which can facilitate reusing the context resources in different coal mines. Then, the configuration model connecting context information and business services is constructed to realize the customized service invocation. Thirdly, the method of computational experiment is proposed to verify the availability and validity of service system, i.e. whether the service system can provide the suitable service on time in various virtual accident experiments. A case study is given to explain how to implement the computational experiment on a virtual coal mine simulation platform. Finally, the potential problems in realizing the system are discussed, which will be our research focus in future. PACS: 75.40.-s; 71.20.LP",

In light of the increasingly blurred lines among different categories of testing, I call for a broader discussion of DTC governance.

These issues go beyond questions of clinical utility and validity to those of data security, personal identity, race, and the nature of the family. Robust DTC testing has the power to provide meaningful clinical, genealogical and even forensic information to those who want it; in unscrupulous hands, however, it also has the power to deceive and exploit.

abstract = "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition that affects approximately 70 million people worldwide. Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 30years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the recordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difficult to make in the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier.",

Reliability of automated energy consumption management relies upon context-aware continuous authentications of users in executing time-critical tasks. In particular, the contexts of mobility of users and the critical nature of the task are important. Continuous authentication is a robust technique to ensure validity of the authenticity of users over time. Existing continuous authentication techniques do not use the contextual information and dynamic user behavioral characteristics for authentications. We propose a novel context-aware multi-attribute continuous authentication model for secure energy utilization management in smart homes. We use location and the critical nature of the tasks as the contextual information as supporting information for selecting the authentication attributes. We propose novel location and task profiles as context specification metrics and a novel relative-importance based attribute selection technique based on N-model. The usefulness of the proposed solution is validated using real-world data sets. Furthermore, the reliability of the proposed risk based resource management model is analysed as a constraint model using linear temporal logic. Based on the experimental results, this research provides meaningful insights to use pragmatic approaches with security and reliability assurances for resource management applications in smart homes.",

abstract = "Big Data (BD), with their potential to ascertain valued insights for enhanced decision-making process, have recently attracted substantial interest from both academics and practitioners. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 – What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 – What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline.",

Several studies have highlighted the need to maintain and build manufacturing capabilities to support economic growth and have linked a nation's as well as region's strength in manufacturing to its ability to innovate. In the U.S., where a manufacturing strategy has largely been absent for the past 25years, advanced manufacturing capabilities are now seen as essential to the development of new products and processes across a range of industries. Against this backdrop, Massachusetts presents an interesting case since manufacturing in this U.S. state is integral to several of its most important industry clusters, yet it is a high wage, high costs state that must compete globally. This research examines the pathways and opportunities for building and fostering innovation capacity among Massachusetts manufacturers, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We employ a systems approach to conduct analytic and empirical analyses that consider how knowledge and sources of innovation flow between key participants within the manufacturing innovation ecosystem. We find that the Massachusetts manufacturing innovation ecosystem is rich in terms of assets but relatively poor in terms of interconnectedness between those assets. In addition, rather than being focused on demand-driven innovation and technological upgrading for SMEs, non-market state-supported manufacturing intermediaries are primarily focused on supply-side, point solutions that work with individual firms rather than at a systems level.",

Inspired by this, the purpose of this paper was to identify the forces shaping the smart city conception and, by doing so, to begin replacing the currently abstract image of what it means to be one. The paper commences by dividing the recent history of smart cities into two large sections – urban futures and the knowledge and innovation economy. The urban futures strand shows that technology has always played an important role in forward-looking visions about the city of the future. The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows that recent technological advancements have introduced a whole new level of knowledge management and innovation capabilities in the urban context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and demand pull for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances rapidly and creates a booming market of smart city products and solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of cities that seek to address the problems of efficiency and sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city product economy. The research route of this paper eventually allows the identification of the underlying – and often forgotten – principles of what it means to be ‘smart’ in an urban context and yields conclusions about strategic planning for the development of smart cities today.",

We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle.

Drawing from literature on innovation, strategy and culture the objective of this study is to explore the role of perceived potentials and perceived strategic importance on CIOs’ perspective on RFID technology in two different cultural settings.
Methodology
Based on survey responses from 463 German and 157 Italian IT decision makers we analyzed the data with PLS structural equation modeling.
Findings
We show that perceived potentials of RFID influence the perceived strategic importance which positively influences CIOs’ intention to invest in RFID. The composition of perceived potentials affecting the strategic importance of RFID differs significantly in both cultures. In Germany, potentials attributed to RFID are improving quality, automating manpower, reducing counterfeits, and improving customer service. Italian CIOs value reducing stock inconsistencies, optimizing stock keeping, and improving customer service as RFID potentials. Regardless of culture, findings show that company size hardly has impact on perceived strategic importance.
Originality/value
This research shows on a large empirical basis cultural differences in the perception of RFID in two countries using PLS.",

We introduce a Nash equilibrium model of noncooperation in terms of cybersecurity levels of the firms involved, which is formulated, analyzed, and solved using variational inequality theory. The equilibrium of this model then acts as the disagreement point over which bargaining takes place in the setting of the second model, which yields a cooperative solution in which the firms are guaranteed that their expected utilities are no lower than those achieved under noncooperation. Nash bargaining theory is utilized to argue for information sharing and to quantify its monetary and security benefits in terms of reduction in network vulnerability to cyberattacks. The third model in this paper also focuses on cooperation among the firms in terms of their cybersecurity levels, but from a system-optimization perspective in which the sum of the expected utilities is maximized. Qualitative properties are provided for the models in terms of existence and uniqueness results along with numerical solutions to two cases focusing on retailers and financial service firms, since these have been subject to some of the most damaging cyberattacks. Sensitivity analysis results are also provided. We compare the solutions of the models for the cases and recommend a course of action that has both financial and policy-related implications.",

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm to change such situation by decoupling network functions from the underlying dedicated hardware and realizing them in the form of software, which are referred to as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Such decoupling introduces many benefits which include reduction of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operation Expense (OPEX), improved flexibility of service provision, etc. In this paper, we intend to present a comprehensive survey on NFV, which starts from the introduction of NFV motivations. Then, we explain the main concepts of NFV in terms of terminology, standardization and history, and how NFV differs from traditional middle-box based network. After that, the standard NFV architecture is introduced using a bottom up approach, based on which the corresponding use cases and solutions are also illustrated. In addition, due to the decoupling of network functionalities and hardware, people’s attention is gradually shifted to the VNFs. Next, we provide an extensive and in-depth discussion on state-of-the-art VNF algorithms including VNF placement, scheduling, migration, chaining and multicast. Finally, to accelerate the NFV deployment and avoid pitfalls as far as possible, we survey the challenges faced by NFV and the trend for future directions. In particular, the challenges are discussed from bottom up, which include hardware design, VNF deployment, VNF life cycle control, service chaining, performance evaluation, policy enforcement, energy efficiency, reliability and security, and the future directions are discussed around the current trend towards network softwarization.",

Empirically, it aims to explore sectoral futures at European level in a range of different sectors (automotive, construction, textile, KIBS, wholesale & retail), to identify cross-cutting patterns of sectoral change, and to highlight implications that these may raise for European innovation policy. In order to do this in a systematic manner, it also has a conceptual and methodological ambition, namely to devise a sectoral innovation foresight methodology that builds explicitly on concepts derived from sectoral innovation systems approaches. This theory-led methodology allows exploring and interpreting future developments at sectoral level in a coherent and comparable manner. Technologies and knowledge, actors and organisations, user needs and demand, as well as institutional and policy frameworks are taken into account; elements that need to co-evolve for any innovation system scenario to unfold. This conceptual framework is translated into a sector innovation foresight methodology that was used to guide a multi-sector foresight initiative. Based on a meta-analysis of insights from five different sectors, cross-sectoral patterns of future change as well as cross-cutting policy issues are pointed out. Three areas of cross-cutting changes have been identified: a) the shift from products to systems and services, b) blurring boundaries between sectors, and c) sectoral and cross-sectoral integration of sustainability demands, and the governance of interactions between sectors. Foresight projects at sectoral level have been conducted rarely as compared to technology-centered or societal-issue centered foresights or retrospective sectoral innovation system studies. By relying explicitly on a theoretical framework of sectoral innovation systems, this paper explores the potential of better linking innovation theory to policy- and strategy-oriented foresight.",

It becomes the most attractive place for life and work for residents. At the same time, building an inviting place that meets the needs of city residents is a difficult task for local governments. Firstly to identify, and secondly to fulfil the citizens’ continuously changing needs. One of the easiest methods to help understand the residents’ needs can be crowdsourcing usage. However the most challenging area of responsibility is to manage traffic by the city logistics infrastructure designed to eliminate congestion problems within existing city spatial and, at the same time, to flexibly reply on transport changing demands. The answer to those challenges facilitating future Smart City logistics development is interoperable IT system usage based on cloud computing model. Similarly, cloud computing, by its design and characteristics, is particularly interesting for the public sector aiming to reduce costs and improve flexibility in operations. The cloud computing model gives unique opportunity to design city logistics infrastructure in the way that it is easily adaptive to changing transport demands. The main objective of the article is to present Smart City logistics on the cloud computing model (Cloud Smart City logistics) as the concept of citizens’ demand-driven flexible logistics infrastructure performance for the sustainable city of the future which is available for any city government interested in sustainable development.",

The identified themes and application areas have been chosen based upon the latest state-of-the-art survey of AHP conducted by [Vaidya, O., & Kumar, S. (2006). Analytic hierarchy process: An overview of applications. European Journal of operational research, 169(1), 1–29.]. To help readers extract quick and meaningful information, the reviewed papers are summarized in various tabular formats and charts. Unlike previous literature surveys, results and findings are made available through an online (and free) testbed, which can serve as a ready reference for those who wish to apply, modify or extend FAHP in various applications areas. This online testbed makes also available one or more fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices (FPCMs) from all the reviewed papers (255 matrices in total). In terms of results and findings, this survey shows that: (i) FAHP is used primarily in the Manufacturing, Industry and Government sectors; (ii) Asia is the torchbearer in this field, where FAHP is mostly applied in the theme areas of Selection and Evaluation; (iii) a significant amount of research papers (43% of the reviewed literature) combine FAHP with other tools, particularly with TOPSIS, QFD and ANP (AHP’s variant); (iv) Chang’s extent analysis method, which is used for FPCMs’ weight derivation in FAHP, is still the most popular method in spite of a number of criticisms in recent years (considered in 57% of the reviewed literature).",

Then, we proposed a novel routing protocol, Circular/Spherical Sector based Forwarding Area Division and Adaptive Forwarding Area Selection (FADS), which can avoid Distinct-Slot collision, reduce the probability of Same-Slot collision, and realize dynamic load balancing. 1) Forwarding area division ensures that every node within the same forwarding subarea is capable of hearing one another, thus avoiding Distinct-Slot collision. 2) Selecting forwarder from one of subarea decreases the number of contenders(candidates), hence the probability of Same-Slot collision is reduced. 3) Adaptive forwarding area selection dynamic channelizes the traffic to each subarea, thus realizing dynamic load balancing. Compared with related protocols, no matter in the 2D or 3D scenario, simulation results show the excellent performance of FADS in terms of packet delivery ratio, End-to-End latency, and energy consumption per packet, especially in dense networks and congested networks.",

Most notably, the negative effects of interruptions delivered without consideration were smaller in this experiment.

Le vieillissement de la population et l’augmentation des maladies chroniques génèrent de nouvelles problématiques en termes de parcours de soins.

L’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la communication en santé (ou «e-santé»), poussée par des technologies matures et le gouvernement, est un des vecteurs d’aide à la mutation de notre système de soins. La prise en charge des pathologies cancéreuses est un domaine auquel les possibilités offertes par la e-santé s’appliquent tout particulièrement. Les prises en charge ambulatoires sont largement privilégiées avec des traitements rapidement évolutifs et complexes à la fois dans leur maniement et leurs toxicités. Ces nouvelles thérapies imposent donc un suivi de l’observance et une formation continue des professionnels de santé. Cet article propose d’exposer les fondements de l’e-santé et de la m-santé, sa composante mobile, puis de discuter leur place dans la prise en charge des pathologies cancéreuses, à la fois pour les patients et les professionnels de santé.

This trend contributes to changes in data governance strategy in the organisation, such as the organisation’s structure and regulations, people, technology, process, roles and responsibilities. This is one of the great challenges facing organizations today when they move their data to Cloud Computing environments, particularly how Cloud technology affects data governance. The authors’ general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is concerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reaching maturity.

abstract = "Reliable data have always played a vital role in time series analysis and research. Nevertheless, missing data, which can bias the original properties of the time series if the pattern of missed data is systematic, is also a very common phenomenon in observed processes. Thus, how to address missing values is a very important challenge, especially in the upcoming big data era. This paper proposes the cuckoo search-designated fractal interpolation functions (CS-DFIFs) method and the CS-DFIFs-winners combining (CS-DFIFs-WC) method for estimating missing values. The former method skillfully transforms Fractal Interpolation Functions (FIFs) to make it possible to calculate a specified point's missing value, which is difficult to obtain with the traditional approach. Then, to optimize the parameters that transforming process generates, the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) and DFIFs are synthesized into a novel model, CS-DFIFs. Considering classical interpolation methods, such as Linear, Cubic Spline and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation Polynomial (PCHIP), having some born advantages, the inspiration of winners combining is sparked. CS algorithm is used to obtain the best weights of winners in this combined model, CS-DFIFs-WC. Two databases, electricity demands and prices, are chosen to be the numerical testing object at 7 missing levels in this paper. The results show that CS-DFIFs-WC overcomes the deficiency of FIFs that cannot calculate a specified point's missing value, and outperforms benchmarks at almost every level by four criteria.",

The features include mean, median, autoregressive coefficients, etc. The features are further processed by a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to make them more robust. Finally, the features are trained with a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for successful activity recognition. The proposed approach was compared with traditional expression recognition approaches such as typical multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where it outperformed them.",

abstract = "In wireless networks, opportunistic routing (OR) protocols are designed to route data packets towards their destination with greater reliability than traditional routing schemes. In addition to reliability, nodes’ trustworthiness and willingness to cooperate can also play a significant role in the delivery of packets to their final destinations. More specifically, nodes in the network may be compromised, experience software or hardware failures, or behave maliciously for various reasons. Therefore, it would be beneficial to model the behavior of malicious or uncooperative nodes and study their effects in a wireless network that employs OR for communications. In this paper, the behavior of malicious nodes in a wireless mesh network that utilizes unicast opportunistic routing protocols is modeled using Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). Afterwards, using the proposed model, we introduce a novel approach for the calculation of packet drop ratio, through which the negative effects of uncooperative nodes can be calculated. Furthermore, a customized version of a black-hole attack is introduced as an example of malicious behavior in OR protocols; we apply this routing attack to several well-known OR protocols, with the additional use of network simulation as well as through the proposed analytical technique. Finally, a comprehensive set of performance evaluation scenarios is designed and applied, with the purpose of investigating the effects of different parameters on a wireless mesh network that uses OR as a routing approach in the presence of malicious nodes. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed black-hole attack can significantly downgrade communication performance, and the proposed model can properly model the effects of malicious nodes on OR protocols.",

abstract = "Obesity is a global health issue that affects 2.1 billion people worldwide and has an economic impact of approximately $2 trillion. It is a disease that can make the aging process worse by impairing physical function, which can lead to people becoming more frail and immobile. Nevertheless, it is envisioned that technology can be used to aid in motivating behavioural changes to combat this preventable condition. The ubiquitous presence of wearable and mobile devices has enabled a continual stream of quantifiable data (e.g. physiological signals) to be collected about ourselves. This data can then be used to monitor physical activity to aid in self-reflection and motivation to alter behaviour. However, such information is susceptible to noise interference, which makes processing and extracting knowledge from such data challenging. This paper posits our approach that collects and processes physiological data that has been collected from tri-axial accelerometers and a heart-rate monitor, to detect physical activity. Furthermore, an end-user use case application has also been proposed that integrates these findings into a smartwatch visualization. This provides a method of visualising the results to the user so that they are able to gain an overview of their activity. The goal of the paper has been to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning in distinguishing physical activity. This has been achieved by (i) focusing on wearable sensors to collect data and using our methodology to process this raw lifelogging data so that features can be extracted/selected. (ii) Undertaking an evaluation between ten supervised learning classifiers to determine their accuracy in detecting human activity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, this evaluation has been performed across a baseline method and two other methods. (iii) Undertaking an evaluation of the processing time of the approach and the smartwatch battery and network cost analysis between transferring data from the smartwatch to the phone. The results of the classifier evaluations indicate that our approach shows an improvement on existing studies, with accuracies of up to 99% and sensitivities of 100%.",

abstract = "Background
Present day control and monitoring systems are equipped with a large number of heterogeneous devices and are operated by many users with different roles and responsibilities. The information generated by these devices, although preprocessed and filtered, is usually delivered to users regardless of their actual information needs, thus overwhelming cognitive capacities and potentially affecting safety of the system.
Objectives
This work aims to reduce information load to the users of the data-intensive monitoring systems by delivering selected information to each user based on his/her roles in the system and responsibilities.
Methods
The proposed approach combines Semantic Web (SW) technologies and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for configuration purposes and run-time analyzing. The approach is exemplified with implemented tools and feasibility study based on the performance tests. The paper describes principles of proposed approach, demonstrates illustrative scenarios from building automation domain, gives description of implemented tools, and presents results of the initial performance tests.
Results
The combination of SW and CEP brings two major advantages: (1) the behavior of the system could be easily changed by configuring only underlying ontology and (2) utilization of CEP at runtime makes system event-driven and reactive to frequent changes in the environment. The performance tests demonstrated the response time of implemented tools within one second for 1000 updates per second (which corresponded to 10,000 devices in the performed experiments).
Conclusions
It is expected that the proposed approach is able to make monitoring systems personal oriented and thus safer during the operation. The results of the performance tests suggest feasibility of the approach for such systems as building and home automation, and non-critical industrial automation.",

Also, a privacy-preserving piecewise polynomial calculation protocol allows cloud server to securely perform any activation functions in multiple-layer neural network. Moreover, to solve the computation overflow problem, a new protocol called privacy-preserving fraction approximation protocol is designed.

In this perspective, this work presents a model, named SSN, based on the concept of Spontaneous Social Network, which allows the interaction of people anywhere and anytime without the need of any preexisting relation. The main scientific contribution of the SSN model is the possibility of creating social communities based on a combination of multiple contexts, including location, profile and data obtained from external online social networks. In this way, SSN focus on suggesting communities that users are interested in. In the process of developing the model, we propose a methodology for building semantic-based recommendation systems. In terms of evaluation, we performed two experiments using a developed mobile application called Dino. First, we presented hypothetical scenarios based on possible real-world SSN applications to measure users’ perceived sense of community. Second, we asked users to consider their real interests in suggested groups. We computed average values of 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall, respectively. The experiments’ results to assess the proposed scenarios ascertain average values of agreement above 80% for sense of community, belonging, social usefulness, member loyalty, and communities’ ephemerality. Therefore, our evaluation depicts that dynamic virtual communities formed by a SSN model based application would beneficially improve a social-aware virtual environment.",

We introduce a scheduling-based cooperation incentive scheme which enables machine nodes to organize themselves locally, create machine groups, and communicate through group representatives to the base station. This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which takes into account the cooperation level of each node, reimburses the extra energy consumptions of group representatives, and maximizes the network lifetime. As reusing cellular uplink resources for communications inside the groups degrades the Quality of Service (QoS) of the primary users, analytical results are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number of simultaneously active machine groups in a given cell and QoS of the primary users. Furthermore, we extend our derived solutions for the existing cellular networks, propose a cooperation-incentive LTE scheduler, and present our simulation results in the context of LTE. The simulation results show that the proposed solutions significantly prolong the network lifetime. Also, it is shown that under certain circumstances, reusing uplink resource by machine devices can degrade the outage performance of the primary users significantly, and hence, coexistence management of machine devices and cellular users is of paramount importance for next generations of cellular networks in order to enable group-based machine-type communications while guaranteeing QoS for the primary users.",

abstract = "Information technology-based methods, such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), play an important role in industrial transformation and evolution. However, while significant efforts have been made towards CPS application in several other industry sectors, the exploration of CPS benefits and applicability to the construction industry is at the initial stage. While CPS has been identified as a promising solution to address problems in the construction industry, few explorations have been made on CPS application to temporary structures, which have significant safety issues that urgently need to be addressed. With a focus on the enhanced monitoring of temporary structures to prevent potential structural failures, this study proposed a CPS-based temporary structures monitoring (TSM) system that integrates the virtual model of a temporary structure and the physical structure on the construction jobsite. In doing this, the applicability of CPS to temporary structures monitoring is investigated, and end user requirements and system requirements are identified for system design. In addition, a system architecture and a description of the issues surrounding the choice of a system development environment are presented. For better understanding of how the TSM works, aspects of the developed CPS-based TSM are presented with system workflow and simulated examples of the structural monitoring of a scaffolding system. The potential benefits and barriers to CPS implementation in temporary structures, along with future research based on this study, are highlighted.",

abstract = "Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect’s face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer’s uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.",

However, the flourishing of IoV still faces several challenges in terms of location privacy preservation, vehicular sensory data collection and vehicular sensory data acquisition. Aiming at these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel efficient and location privacy-preserving data sharing scheme with collusion resistance in IoV, which enables the collection and distribution of the data captured by vehicular sensors. During the vehicular sensory data collection phase, each vehicle structures the multi-dimensional sensory data captured at different locations and exploits the modified Paillier Cryptosystem to achieve the location privacy-preserving sensory data aggregation, while the data aggregation result of multiple vehicles can be recovered by the trusted central entity. During the vehicular sensory data acquisition phase, the proposed scheme exploits the proxy re-encryption technique to achieve the location privacy-preserving data querying at the network edge, i.e., the vehicles query the RSU instead of the trusted central entity. Numerical analysis are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, i.e., low data querying failure probability. Security analysis and performance evaluations are also carried out to validate the security properties and show the computation and communication efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

Although video-based facial expression analysis has been focused on by many researchers, there are still various problems to be solved in this regard such as noise due to illumination variations over time. Depth video data in the helps to make an FER system person-independent as pixel values in depth images are distributed based on distances from a depth camera. Besides, depth images should resolve some privacy issues as real identity of a user can be hidden. The accuracy of an FER system is much dependent on the extraction of robust features. Here, we propose a novel method to extract salient features from depth faces that are further combined with deep learning for efficient training and recognition. Eight directional strengths are obtained for each pixel in a depth image where signs of some top strengths are arranged to represent unique as well as robust face features, which can be denoted as Modified Local Directional Patterns (MLDP). The MLDP features are further processed by Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) for better face feature extraction. GDA is an efficient tool that helps distinguishing MLDP features of different facial expressions by clustering the features from the same expression as close as possible and separating the features from different expressions as much as possible in a non-linear space. Then, MLDP-GDA features are applied with Deep Belief Network (DBN) for training different facial expressions. Finally, the trained DBN is used to recognize facial expressions in a depth video for testing. The proposed approach was compared with other traditional approaches in a standalone system where the proposed one showed its superiority by achieving mean recognition rate of 96.25% where the other approaches could make 91.67% at the best. The deep learning-based training and recognition of the facial expression features can also be undertaken with cloud computing to support many users and make the system faster than a standalone system.",

abstract = "Storing and sharing of medical data in the cloud environment, where computing resources including storage is provided by a third party service provider, raise serious concern of individual privacy for the adoption of cloud computing technologies. Existing privacy protection researches can be classified into three categories, i.e., privacy by policy, privacy by statistics, and privacy by cryptography. However, the privacy concerns and data utilization requirements on different parts of the medical data may be quite different. The solution for medical dataset sharing in the cloud should support multiple data accessing paradigms with different privacy strengths. The statistics or cryptography technology alone cannot enforce the multiple privacy demands, which blocks their application in the real-world cloud. This paper proposes a practical solution for privacy preserving medical record sharing for cloud computing. Based on the classification of the attributes of medical records, we use vertical partition of medical dataset to achieve the consideration of different parts of medical data with different privacy concerns. It mainly includes four components, i.e., (1) vertical data partition for medical data publishing, (2) data merging for medical dataset accessing, (3) integrity checking, and (4) hybrid search across plaintext and ciphertext, where the statistical analysis and cryptography are innovatively combined together to provide multiple paradigms of balance between medical data utilization and privacy protection. A prototype system for the large scale medical data access and sharing is implemented. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.",

BDA is especially relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However, supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result. Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and strategic decision-making.",

In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of IURVs with different forms. Five case studies are presented of IURVs in the countries with the largest number of IURVs involving US universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of IURVs depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the IURV in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved.",

We focus on different types of collaboration that can occur and on the knowledge sharing (KS) dynamics of this collaboration. We employ a multiple-case study approach to analyze nine BMI processes from companies that transformed their traditional business model (BM) to a servitized BM. As a result, we obtain a theoretical framework that presents six possible KS dynamics for the servitization design by originally combining two main approaches for servitization-driven BMI (i.e. product-oriented and service-oriented product-service systems) and three main configurations of relationships with service suppliers based on traditional new product development classifications of buyer-supplier integration (i.e. white, grey and black box configurations). Implications of combining a BMI and a buyer-supplier KS perspectives to investigate the process of servitization for manufacturing companies are then discussed.",

The ubiquity of such sensing devices offers the potential to realise novel applications based on collaborative sensing, in which application logic makes use of sensor input from a number of handsets, typically distributed across a defined physical area. Such applications will be enabled by mobile cloud computing, with the devices transferring raw or pre-processed sensed data to application logic hosted in the cloud. This results in a trade-off between the quality of the sensed data received by applications and the energy required to transfer data from the mobile handsets. We address this trade-off by considering a scheme in which a collaborative sensing middleware mediates between multiple applications requiring sensed data and the mobile handsets located within a particular physical area. We present and evaluate an algorithm which seeks to maximise the degree to which sensed data transferred from a given mobile device can be served to more than one application. We show that this algorithm leads to better overall performance in terms of energy used than an algorithm which does not aggregate sensed information between applications.",

abstract = "This study presents an efficient incremental/decremental approach for big streams based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), a frequently used data analysis in cloud centers. To avoid reanalyzing the whole dataset whenever sensors receive new training data, typical incremental KRR used a single-instance mechanism for updating an existing system. However, this inevitably increased redundant computational time, not to mention applicability to big streams. To this end, the proposed mechanism supports incremental/decremental processing for both single and multiple samples (i.e., batch processing). A large scale of data can be divided into batches, processed by a machine, without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover, incremental/decremental analyses in empirical and intrinsic space are also proposed in this study to handle different types of data either with a large number of samples or high feature dimensions, whereas typical methods focused only on one type. At the end of this study, we further the proposed mechanism to statistical Kernelized Bayesian Regression, so that uncertainty modeling with incremental/decremental computation becomes applicable. Experimental results showed that computational time was significantly reduced, better than the original nonincremental design and the typical single incremental method. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed method remained the same as the baselines. This implied that the system enhanced efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. These findings proved that the proposed method was appropriate for variable streaming data analysis, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

It makes the medical search technologies become critical to find useful patient information in the large medical dataset.

In this paper, by exploiting the uncertainty in ambiguous medical queries, we propose a novel semantic-based approach to achieve the diversity-aware retrieval of EMRs, i.e., both the relevance and novelty are considered for EMR ranking. With the support of medical domain ontologies, we first mine all the potential semantics (concepts and relations between them) from a user query and consume them to model the multiple query aspects. Then, we propose a novel diversification strategy, which considers not only the aspect importance but also the aspect similarity, to perform the diversity-aware EMR ranking. A real-world pilot study, which utilizes the proposed medical search approach to improve the second use of the EMRs, is reported. We believe that our experience can serve as an important reference for the development of similar applications in a medical data utilization and sharing environment.",

This article presents an alternative approach for constructing scenarios of privacy protection. The article focuses on privacy protection as a social institution and builds on the theory of gradual institutional change. The article presents a scenario framework which includes three stages: (1) outlining the dynamics of privacy protection, (2) tracing historical processes and constructing a causal narrative, and (3) creating event-based scenarios. The resulting scenarios are narratives of plausible chains of events which are based on the results of the previous stages. The key difference to typical scenario approaches is the focus on specific actors and types of event sequences in privacy protection. The argument is that by lowering the level of abstraction in this way, researchers and decision-makers can gain a more profound understanding of possible future challenges in privacy protection and of key leverage points in the institutional change process.",

abstract = "Recently, Device-to-Device (D2D) multimedia communications have been envisioned as emerging technology for improving capacity and reducing power consumption in wireless networks. In D2D multimedia communications, multimedia applications consume considerable amount of energy and bandwidth resources to satisfy increasing mobile user demands. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a novel energy consumption optimization method (ECO) for green D2D multimedia communications by using Adaptive Genetic Algorithm. In particular, we first encode the videos by using layered multiple description coding with forward error correction (LMDC-FEC) to protect against error and delays as well as more adaptive to unstable bandwidth in wireless channels. To minimize the average energy consumption by packetizing and transmitting, we then formulate the energy consumption optimization problem and solve it to find out the optimal encoding rate matrix allocated to each video under limited bandwidth resource and high quality constraints. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed ECO method can achieve remarkable improvements in terms of energy saving, i.e., save up to 64% average energy consumption compared to the other methods, while ensuring high received video quality and satisfying given limited bandwidth.",

RFID can support automatic information tracing and management during the management process in many fields. A typical field that uses RFID is modern warehouse management, where products are attached with tags and the inventory of products is managed by retrieving tag IDs. Many practical applications require searching a group of tags to determine whether they are in the system or not. The existing studies on tag searching mainly focused on improving the time efficiency but paid little attention to energy efficiency which is extremely important for active tags powered by built-in batteries. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the tag searching problem from the energy efficiency perspective. We first propose an Energy-efficient tag Searching protocol in Multiple reader RFID systems, namely ESiM, which pushes per tag energy consumption to the limit as each tag needs to exchange only one bit data with the reader. We then develop a time efficiency enhanced version of ESiM, namely TESiM, which can dramatically reduce the execution time while only slightly increasing the transmission overhead. Extensive simulation experiments reveal that, compared to state-of-the-art solution in the current literature, TESiM reduces per tag energy consumption by more than one order of magnitude subject to comparable execution time. In most considered scenarios, TESiM even reduces the execution time by more than 50%.",

These include inequality, poverty, corruption and migration, as well as climate change, loss of habitat and the ageing society. A conceptual framework for open governance systems enabled by ICT is proposed, drawing on evidence and examples from around the world as well as a critical appraisal of both academic and grey literature. The framework constructs a system of open assets, open services and open engagement, and this is used to move the e-government debate forward from a preoccupation with lean and small governments which ‘do more with less’ to examine the potential for open governance systems to also ‘do more with more’. This is achieved by enabling an open government and open public sector, as part of this open governance system, to ‘do more by leveraging more’ of the existing assets and resources across the whole of society, and not just within the public sector, many of which are unrealised and untapped, so in effect are ‘wasted’. The paper argues that efficiencies and productivity improvements are essential at all levels and across all actors, as is maximising both public and private value, but that they must also be seen at the societal level where trade-offs and interactions are required, and not only at the individual actor level.",

abstract = "Context
The software architecture of a system is the result of a set of architectural decisions. The topic of architectural decisions in software engineering has received significant attention in recent years. However, no systematic overview exists on the state of research on architectural decisions.
Objective
The goal of this study is to provide a systematic overview of the state of research on architectural decisions. Such an overview helps researchers reflect on previous research and plan future research. Furthermore, such an overview helps practitioners understand the state of research, and how research results can help practitioners in their architectural decision-making.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study, covering studies published between January 2002 and January 2012. We defined six research questions. We queried six reference databases and obtained an initial result set of 28,895 papers. We followed a search and filtering process that resulted in 144 relevant papers.
Results
After classifying the 144 relevant papers for each research question, we found that current research focuses on documenting architectural decisions. We found that only several studies describe architectural decisions from the industry. We identified potential future research topics: domain-specific architectural decisions (such as mobile), achieving specific quality attributes (such as reliability or scalability), uncertainty in decision-making, and group architectural decisions. Regarding empirical evaluations of the papers, around half of the papers use systematic empirical evaluation approaches (such as surveys, or case studies). Still, few papers on architectural decisions use experiments.
Conclusion
Our study confirms the increasing interest in the topic of architectural decisions. This study helps the community reflect on the past ten years of research on architectural decisions. Researchers are offered a number of promising future research directions, while practitioners learn what existing papers offer.",

abstract = "Background and objectives
Recent advances in miniature biomedical sensors, mobile smartphones, wireless communications, and distributed computing technologies provide promising techniques for developing mobile health systems. Such systems are capable of monitoring epileptic seizures reliably, which are classified as chronic diseases. Three challenging issues raised in this context with regard to the transformation, compression, storage, and visualization of big data, which results from a continuous recording of epileptic seizures using mobile devices.
Methods
In this paper, we address the above challenges by developing three new algorithms to process and analyze big electroencephalography data in a rigorous and efficient manner. The first algorithm is responsible for transforming the standard European Data Format (EDF) into the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and compressing the transformed JSON data to decrease the size and time through the transfer process and to increase the network transfer rate. The second algorithm focuses on collecting and storing the compressed files generated by the transformation and compression algorithm. The collection process is performed with respect to the on-the-fly technique after decompressing files. The third algorithm provides relevant real-time interaction with signal data by prospective users. It particularly features the following capabilities: visualization of single or multiple signal channels on a smartphone device and query data segments.
Results
We tested and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a software architecture model implementing a mobile health system to monitor epileptic seizures. The experimental findings from 45 experiments are promising and efficiently satisfy the approach's objectives in a price of linearity. Moreover, the size of compressed JSON files and transfer times are reduced by 10% and 20%, respectively, while the average total time is remarkably reduced by 67% through all performed experiments.
Conclusions
Our approach successfully develops efficient algorithms in terms of processing time, memory usage, and energy consumption while maintaining a high scalability of the proposed solution. Our approach efficiently supports data partitioning and parallelism relying on the MapReduce platform, which can help in monitoring and automatic detection of epileptic seizures.",

We work under the hypothesis that a risk-prone situation produces sudden and significant deviations in standard physiological and behavioural user patterns. These changes can be captured by a group of sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate. We introduce a dataset, called PRIDE, which provides a baseline for the development and the fair comparison of personal risk detection mechanisms. PRIDE contains information on 18 test subjects; for each subject, it includes partial information about the user’s behavioural and physiological patterns, as captured by Microsoft Band©. PRIDE test subject records include sensor readings of not only when a subject is carrying out ordinary daily life activities, but also when exposed to a stressful scenario, thereby simulating a dangerous or abnormal situation. We show how to use PRIDE to develop a personal risk detection mechanism; to accomplish this, we have tackled risk detection as a one-class classification problem. We have trained several classifiers based only on the daily behaviour of test subjects. Further, we tested the accuracy of the classifiers to detect anomalies that were not included in the training process of the classifiers. We used a number of one-class classifiers, namely: SVM, Parzen, and two versions of Parzen based on k-means. While there is still room for improvement, our results are encouraging: they support our hypothesis that abnormal behaviour can be automatically detected.",

The theory of complex systems provides a set of heuristics that can be applied to support the formalization of the LSE industrial network and its dynamics, demonstrating how they can be enabled and at the same time controlled to keep the overall level of interoperability stable. Hence, today there is technology suitable to implement such systems, capable to realize the LSE real, digital and virtual worlds.

Then, existing technology such as model-driven interoperability, agent-based or service oriented architectures, and knowledge management, is proposed to detail the conceptual solution for the sustainability of interoperability.

These algorithms are the backbone of data protection and secrecy for highly sensitive and classified data. The selection of a suitable crypto-algorithm will dynamically affect the lifespan and performance of a device in terms of battery-life, hardware memory, computation latency and communication bandwidth. In the current developments of the resource constrained environments, the trend is shifting towards lightweight algorithmic hardware designs. To select a suitable cryptographic algorithm for an application or an environment, the understandings of both the algorithmic requirements in terms of hardware and the specifications of the development platform intended has to be established. However, there are numerous ciphers in the literature that has various functionality, specifications and strength. Moreover, there are numerous literatures that cover the trend and specifications of security solutions in hardware constrained environment, employing known cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of modern symmetric cryptographic solutions used in resource constrained environment (RCE), including literatures from the area of wireless sensor network (WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) and other resource constrained platforms.

Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the growing role of cloud computing in Big Data ecosystem.

XCloudX symbolizes those NoSQL Big Data models that embody the term “cloud” in their name, where X is any alphanumeric variable. The discussion is strengthen by a set of important case studies.

abstract = "Internet was developed as a packet data network where users and data sources (server) with specific IP addresses interacted over a pre-established communication channel. This model of client–server data communication has evolved into a peer-to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times. Applications like, YouTube, Bit Torrent, social networks have revolutionized the idea of user generated contents. Modern users care only for specific data items irrespective of their sources. So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth. We have also covered several NDN applications. We conclude our survey by identifying a set of open challenges which should be addressed by researchers in due course.",

These computing devices may be supported by different types of operating systems with different features and levels of security support. In order to ensure that all operations within the environment can be carried out seamlessly in an ad-hoc manner, there is a need for a common mobile platform to be developed. The purpose of this long-term project is to investigate and implement a new functional layered model of the common mobile platform with secured and trusted ensemble computing architecture for an innovative Digital Economic Environment in the Malaysian context. This mobile platform includes a lightweight operating system to provide a common virtual environment, a middleware for providing basic functionalities of routing, resource and network management, as well as to provide security, privacy and a trusted environment. A generic application programming interface is provided for application developers to access underlying resources. The aim is for the developed platform to act as the building block for an ensemble environment, upon which higher level applications could be built.

abstract = "A nanonetwork is comprised of nanoscale sensors and communicating devices facilitating communication at the nanoscale, which is a promising technology for application in health applications such as intra-body health monitoring and drug delivery. However, the communication performance within a nanonetwork is substantially limited by the energy loss as the Electromagnetic (EM) wave propagates along the channel. Energy harvesting for nanosensor networks can provide a way to overcome the energy bottleneck without considering the lifetime of batteries. Moreover, relaying protocols for nanoscale communications have been proposed to improve the communication performance and extend the transmission distances among nanosensors within nanonetworks. The combination of energy harvesting and a relaying protocol provides an emerging solution not only to overcome the aforementioned energy issues but also enhance the system performance. Therefore, in this paper, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer nanonetworks in the Terahertz (THz) Band (0.1-10 THz) is proposed. An amplify and forward (AF) relaying nanonetwork in this band is investigated, where the relay harvests energy from the received THz signal which is then consumed to forward the information to the destination. Performance based on both time-switching and power-splitting protocols is analyzed. The numerical results show the optimal power-splitting ratio and time switching ratio that achieves the maximum throughput at the destination as well as the impact of transmission distance on system performance. It is seen that the power-splitting protocol gives greater throughput than that of the time-switching protocol.",

Indeed, congestion has a significant impact on Quality of Services (QoS) parameters such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption in wireless nodes. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of major congestion control mechanisms used in WSNs and classifies the available methods into four categories i.e. traffic control protocols, resource control protocols, queue assisted protocols and priority-aware protocols.

These advancements are expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response (DR) programs. As various national and international organizations have started to draw PLC regulations, standards and technologies for countries, these standards intend to determine important criteria such as bandwidth, modulation types, channel coding schemes, operating frequency and electromagnetic capability limits from fixed indoor/outdoor applications to smart grid (SG) applications. Depending on the worldwide PLC regulation, standardization and technological developments, security schemes built around them can become interoperable from a standard point of view, but still have incompatible configurations or different maturity levels, or include non-standardized PLC functions. Moreover, the PLC based systems/solutions for renewable energy integration, are also surveyed in terms of distributed-power system (DPS) and distributed energy resources (DERs) units monitoring/controlling and management purposes. Thus, a particular section is dedicated to PLC based systems/solutions utilization of renewable energy sources (RESs) in SG covering all aspects of a monotype and hybrid energy plants.

The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category.

Vibration energy harvesting and sensing is a traditional and growing research field in which various working mechanisms and designs have been developed for an improved performance.

The demonstrated instantaneous energy conversion efficiency of ∼70% and a total efficiency up to 85% distinguished TENG from traditional techniques. In this article, both TENG-enabled vibration energy harvesting and self-powered active sensing are comprehensively reviewed. Moving toward future development, problems pressing for solutions and onward research directions are also posed to deliver a coherent picture.",

The WSN can be used in domains such as agriculture, energy, industrial automation, medical health care, smart building, and so on. In industry, the characteristics of the wireless channel are different in comparison to other WSN environments, such as home and office environments. The use of WSN in industry is subject to typical problems of wireless communications, such as noise, shadowing, multipath fading and interference. In addition, the wireless channel in many industrial environments is non-stationary for a long term, which can cause abrupt changes in the characteristics of the channel over time. A set of standards was developed for industrial WSN, to overcome these limitations, such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, WIA-PA, and IEEE 802.15.4e. All the mentioned standards are based on the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer, but define different mechanisms for the upper layers. However, according to recent publications, problems still can arise in the deployment of networks that follow the standards, because of multipath effects, and interference. This survey provides a structured overview of the standards used to implement industrial WSN, their advantages and drawbacks, and discusses the characteristics of the wireless channel in industrial environments. Finally, a systematic mapping is described, that presents results of publications about industrial WSN, and highlights important topics to be studied in this field.",

The system consists of a customized harness outfitted with wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a base station for processing IMU data to classify canine postures. Research in operant conditioning, the science of behavior change, indicates that successful animal training requires consistent and accurate feedback on behavior. Properly designed computer systems excel at timeliness and accuracy, which are two characteristics most amateur trainers struggle with and professionals strive for. Therefore, in addition to the system being ergonomically designed to ensure the dog׳s comfort and well-being, it is engineered to provide posture detection with timing and accuracy on par with a professional trainer. We contend that providing a system with these characteristics will one day aid dogs in learning from humans by overcoming poor or ineffective timing during training. We present the initial steps in the development and validation of a computer-assisted training system designed to work outside of laboratory environments. The main contributions of this work are (a) to explore the trade-off between low-latency responses to changes in time-series IMU data representative of posture changes while maintaining accuracy and timing similar to a professional trainer, and (b) to provide a model for future ACI technologies by documenting the user-centered approach we followed to create a computer-assisted training system that met the criteria identified in (a). Accordingly, in addition to describing our system, we present the results of three experiments to characterize the performance of the system at capturing sit postures of dogs and providing timely reinforcement. These trade-offs are illustrated through the comparison of two algorithms. The first is Random Forest classification and the second is an algorithm which uses a Variance-based Threshold for classification of postures. Results indicate that with proper parameter tuning, our system can successfully capture and reinforce postures to provide computer-assisted training of dogs.",

The purpose of the proposed middleware within the project is twofold: for one, to ensure universal, homogeneous access to the system’s functions and secondly, to fulfill functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Namely, the infrastructure itself should consume significantly low power (as it is meant for energy savings in addition to automations), without compromising reliability and fast response time. The infrastructure should enable fast and direct discovery, invocation and execution of services. Finally, on hardware level, the wireless sensor and actuator network should be optimally configured for speed and reliability as well. The proposed solution employs widely used web open standards for description and discovery to expose hardware and software functions and ensure interoperability, even outside the borders of this university deployment. It proposes a straightforward method to integrate low-cost and resource-constrained heterogeneous devices found in the market and a large-scale placement of servers and wireless sensor networks. Different server hardware installations have been evaluated to find the optimum trade-off between response time and power consumption. Finally, a range of client applications that exploit the middleware on different platforms are demonstrated, to prove its usability and effectiveness in enabling, in this scenario, energy monitoring and savings.",

We warn and advise the regulator that research platforms and the use of other equipment for the collection and processing of personal data in the Union for research may escape from data protection legislation once the new data protection regulation applies. This is due to the revised territorial application rules in the new regulation. We therefore plead for more reflection and clear terminology and for keeping the criterion of the use of equipment for the territorial application of data protection legislation. Rejecting this criterion may result in considerable better (competitive) positions for non-Union companies and institutions collecting and using personal data collected in the Union for research as compared to Union research organisations.",

Cooperation is an emergent social state related to the dynamics and complexity of road traffic and reinforced learning. Game theory and research in behavioral economics show that cooperation can be leveraged to efficiently solve social dilemmas similar to traffic congestion. We review the applicability of behavioral economics and game theory concepts to route, mode and departure time choice problems. Beyond advancing theory, research on cooperation in the context of transportation is still in its infancy. We discuss state-of-the-art methodologies and their weaknesses and review the unexplored opportunities inherent in game-based methodologies. A behavioral-technological research agenda for FET is also discussed.",

Unfortunately, the MOOC data are not fully utilized for educational innovation, because the existing research focuses on the data generated in the online learning but neglects other related data, such as the forum data. In this article, we propose a big-data-driven approach named TOLA for online learning evolution to discover students’ learning pattern and guide courses improvement. Specifically, topic feature is extracted from MOOC forum through Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which is incorporated with other hybrid features. Through experiments, TOLA exhibits good performance in terms of complexity, efficiency and accuracy, facilitating the improvement of the quality of online education.",

abstract = "Low-cost conductometric transducers have been designed and characterised with a view to their potential use as chemiresistors in mobile sensor applications. Four different geometries of transducer have been evaluated by two different measurement techniques. Devices were fabricated by etching planar gold electrodes on low-cost glass-fibre substrates (FR-4) using a standard printed circuit board (PCB) photolithography, wet etching and electroless plating method. Thin films of the P-type semiconducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT-PSS, were cast onto the electrodes by spin-coating. The conducting polymer films were electrically characterised by measuring the film resistance from the underlying gold electrodes using a digital multimeter, and also by determination of the film's current–voltage transfer characteristic (I–V curve) measured with a precision laboratory 4-point probe instrument. This allowed the relative contribution of the contact resistance at the Au/PEDOT-PSS interface to be determined as a proportion of the overall measured resistance. Contact resistance is known to affect the analytical performance of chemiresistor type devices, so in this work the combined effects of electrode geometry, polymer film composition and ageing of the film on bulk film and contact resistances have been investigated. The applicability of the chemiresistor transducers for chemical sensing is demonstrated using a PEDOT-PSS thin film as an ethanol vapour sensitive coating in a simple vapour exposure test, where a reversible conductometric response was observed. Due to the simplicity, low-cost and ultra low-power requirements of these transducers, they may be particularly suited to battery powered mobile and wireless sensing applications, or to applications dependant upon energy harvesting.",

As such, this paper is the first work that attempts to analyse this connection econometrically by setting up a proxy index of data regulation using a typology of existing indices of administrative barriers. We show that the type of regulations prevalent in data indeed tends to affect downstream industry performance of industries that depend more heavily on data services for the countries under consideration in our study. Finally, the negative performance outcomes as a result of data regulation in these countries are employed in a general equilibrium analysis using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) in order to estimate the impact on country-specific GDP, industry production, and foreign trade.",

The low power consumption and the high versatility of the power management unit allow its implementation within single- and multi-source power management circuits for piezoelectric converters. Experimental results show that the proposed single-source power management circuit is able to extract energy from a piezoelectric converter excited by sinusoidal vibrations with an acceleration amplitude of 0.5gRMS in the frequency range between 38 and 49Hz, yielding an operating bandwidth of 12Hz. Such operating bandwidth is up to 71.4% greater than tailored commercial energy harvesting solutions under the same experimental conditions. Innovative multi-source power management circuits which exploit the series-like and parallel-like combinations of multiple power management units are presented. The limitations of traditional topologies are overcome by connecting each piezoelectric converter to a power management unit. In particular, the proposed inverting, buck-boost, parallel-like, power management circuit combines the energy from the storage capacitors of each power management unit in a single storage capacitor exploiting a switch on inductor through trigger circuits. Experimental results show that the proposed inverting buck-boost power stage has an overall efficiency of about 8.5%.",

Advantages of such a mechanism includes privacy preservation across coexisting networks since there is no explicit interaction among nodes, seamless integration of multiple trust domains without higher layer involvements, and ability to operate in high BER channels. An energy-efficiency module is also designed which uses sleep-wake scheduling to minimize the energy consumption in the system. It was shown that protocols following the proposed mechanism are able to achieve the above goals without any form of time synchronization among the network nodes. We have implemented and evaluated the protocol using NS2 simulator and the performance of the protocol has been demonstrated using extensive simulation models. Energy efficiency has been evaluated by developing analytical models which has been compared with simulation results.",

Web applications have become the most popular way to deliver essential services to customers, and the increasing dependency of individuals on web applications makes them an attractive target for adversaries. The adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the database-driven applications to craft injection attacks which include SQL, XQuery and XPath injections. A large amount of work has been done on identification of SQL injection vulnerabilities resulting in several tools available for the purpose. However, a limited work has been done so far for the identification of XML injection vulnerabilities and the existing tools only identify XML injection vulnerabilities which could lead to a specific type of attack. Hence, this work proposes a black-box fuzzing approach to detect different types of XQuery injection vulnerabilities in web applications driven by native XML databases. A prototype XQueryFuzzer is developed and tested on various vulnerable applications developed with BaseX as the native XML database. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the prototype is effective against detection of XQuery injection vulnerabilities. Three new categories of attacks specific to XQuery, but not listed in OWASP are identified during testing.",

The bloom filter shares some similarities to a standard hash table but has a higher storage efficiency. As a drawback, bloom filters allow the existence of false positives. These properties make bloom filters a suitable candidate for storing topological information in large-scale mobile ad hoc networks, where there is a considerable amount of data to be exchanged. Bloom filters enable the transmission of reduced routing control messages to save available bandwidth, and they require fewer node resources than traditional data structures. Existing ad hoc routing protocols using bloom filters limit themselves to static sensor networks or small/medium-scale mobile networks. In this study, we propose and analyse a routing protocol suited for large scale mobile ad hoc networks (up to 3000 nodes) that stores and disseminates topological information through a specific type of bloom filter that is able to discard old elements. Logical overlays are then constructed with the proposed data structures to indicate the distance to the destination nodes. This process allows the routing protocol to reduce the number of control messages required to discover and maintain routes. The proposed algorithm is validated via simulation and compared with other well-known routing protocols developed for mobile ad hoc networks.",

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses of high integration, fusion, and applicability potential in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.",

abstract = "Human motion sensing based on wearable sensors could be viewed as a multi-objects tracking issue of human body joints. Sensor drift errors and distortion are the main challenges of the tracking accuracy of human motion. Traditional filtering and fusion methods, such as Kalman filter, can to some extent reduce the instantaneous error but cannot avoid sensor drift fundamentally. Physical characteristics of human body should be considered and human motion models should be exhibited to describe human motions. The existing models such as skeleton model and cylinder model are either too simple or too complicated for practical applications. In this study, we put forward a geometrical kinematic characteristics based human motion model. The whole human body is viewed as an articulated skeleton and Denavit–Hartenberg convention is adopted to describe the forward kinematics structure. Theoretical analysis is conducted with the derivation of Posterior Cramer–Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) in human movement scenes based on proposed model. Significant superiority is shown in simulation results. An experiment on human lower limb motions is carried out to verify the validity of the proposed human motion model in practice applications, from the angles of both capturing accuracy and energy consumption. The capturing accuracy has an obvious increase in the testing results, with acceptable energy consumption. It is far more efficient than traditional methods.",

This article examines the main provisions of these Guidelines and highlights the approach adopted by the Consultative Committee, which contextualises the traditional principles of data protection in the big data scenario and also takes into account the challenges of the big data paradigm. The analysis of the different provisions adopted focuses primarily on the core of the Guidelines namely the risk assessment procedure. Moreover, the article discusses the novel solutions provided by the Guidelines with regard to the data subject's informed consent, the by-design approach, anonymization, and the role of the human factor in big data-supported decisions. This critical analysis of the Guidelines introduces a broader reflection on the divergent approaches of the Council of Europe and the European Union to regulating data processing. Where the principle-based model of the Council of Europe differs from the approach adopted by the EU legislator in the detailed Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the light of this, the provisions of the Guidelines and their attempt to address the major challenges of the new big data paradigm set the stage for concluding remarks about the most suitable regulatory model to deal with the different issues posed by the development of technology.",

In particular, we describe the edge-aware inter-domain routing (EIR) protocol which provides new abstractions, such as aggregated-nodes (aNodes) and virtual-links (vLinks) for expressing network topologies and edge network properties necessary to address mobility related routing scenarios which are inadequately supported by the border gateway protocol (BGP) in use today. Specific use-cases addressed by EIR include emerging mobility service scenarios such as multi-homing across WiFi and cellular, multipath routing over several access networks, and anycast access from mobile devices to replicated cloud services. It is shown that EIR can be used to realize efficient routing strategies for the mobility use-cases under consideration, while also providing support for a range of inter-domain routing policies currently associated with BGP. Simulation results for protocol overhead are presented for a global-scale CAIDA topology, leading to an identification of parameters necessary to obtain a good balance between overhead and routing table convergence time. A Click-based proof-of-concept implementation of EIR on the ORBIT testbed is described and used to validate performance and functionality for selected mobility use-cases, including mobile data services with open WiFi access points and mobile platforms such as buses operating in an urban area.",

A large body of literature reported on specific uses of the important data mining paradigm in accounting, but research that takes a holistic view of these uses is lacking. To organize the literature on the applications of data mining in accounting, we create a framework that combines the two well-known accounting reporting perspectives (retrospection and prospection), and the three well-accepted goals of data mining (description, prediction, and prescription). The framework encapsulates a taxonomy of four categories (retrospective-descriptive, retrospective-prescriptive, prospective-prescriptive, and prospective-predictive) of data mining applications in accounting. The proposed framework revealed that the area of accounting that benefited the most from data mining is assurance and compliance, including fraud detection, business health and forensic accounting. The clear gaps seem to be in the two prescriptive application categories (retrospective-prescriptive and prospective-prescriptive), indicating opportunities for benefiting from data mining in these application categories. The framework presents a holistic view of the literature and systematically organizes it in a structurally logical and thematically coherent manner.",

This paper proposes packet priority intimation-based (PPI) congestion control mechanism. We introduce a PPI bit in each packet to reflect its importance. Main objective of this mechanism is to send higher priority packets with minimum delay. The proposed PPI mechanism is deployed in the existing AODV routing protocol to convert the existing routing protocol to a congestion aware routing protocol. The performance of the proposed approach is simulated in Network Simulator (NS2) software and the efficiency is verified. The simulation results are compared with that of an existing approach.",

In the contemporary Internet, many limitations and problems on this area are longtime well-known, including the limited number of namespaces, the overloaded semantics of IP addresses and domain names, the use of network layer names at higher-levels of the architecture, and the limited name resolution capabilities of DNS. More recently, information-centric networking (ICN) and ID/Locator splitting have emerged as important approaches for rethinking the role of naming on the Internet. In addition, flat name schemes and innovative name resolution service (NRS) are being proposed to improve content distribution efficiency and provenance. In this paper, we are proposing a novel, hierarchical, distributed, name resolution and network caching service to support any combination of flat or hierarchical, natural language or self-verified naming. We provide a scientific contribution to the problem of structuring and resolving names composed of bindings among any kind of names in hierarchical autonomous domains. Our differentiated ICN approach is the core of a future Internet architecture called NovaGenesis. We evaluate and compare the performance of our approach for hierarchical name resolution services, specially in terms of how much servers are used (utilization). Results suggest that our proposal can be adopted as an alternative to the current Internet or other ICN approaches, like multi-level distributed hash tables. We report a reduction on name resolution services utilization at more than one level of authoritative domains’ hierarchy. When the probability of a queried domain name is in the cache of a resolver is equal to 0.547 (the typical value today), NovaGenesis root and second level name resolution servers have experimented less than half of the current DNS servers utilization. Finally, we have experimentally evaluated the performance of our proposal in a local domain using a C++ Linux implementation and Docker™ containers, analyzing how the number of name records and hash table nodes impact on name resolution lookup times.",

Malicious users can collaborate to break forward and backward secrecy. Solutions have been proposed to prevent collusion attacks on OFT scheme. In this paper, we first demonstrate how existing solutions only partially consider collusion attacks. Current models surmise scenarios where malicious users may obtain node secrets unknown through collusion. They do not, however, consider that malicious users can decrypt extra blinded node secrets using known node secrets. As a result, the malicious users can collude to obtain far more information than expected. We use theoretical evidence to identify the exact node secrets which can be obtain by malicious users. Finally, we propose two improved schemes named repeated one-way function tree (ROFT) and node one-way function tree (NOFT). Compared to previous solutions, ROFT and NOFT require less adjustments to make the OFT scheme resilient to collusion attacks. Performance analysis shows that ROFT and NOFT do not incur extra communication overhead compared to the original OFT scheme. The proposed ROFT and NOFT schemes effectively solve the security problem of the OFT scheme at the cost of a minimal increase in computational cost and storage overhead.",

abstract = "Information about millions of people is collected for behavioural targeting, a type of marketing that involves tracking people's online behaviour for targeted advertising. It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.",

A known methodology involves behavioral operational research and the emotions involved in decision-making. Three advanced research contributions are unique to the proposed method and NEAR, in contrast to innovative behavioral operational research. Firstly, data are compiled for a neuro decision matrix, based on housing attributes and the valence, arousal, emotional state and physiological parameters of a potential real estate buyer. Secondly, the performance of a multiple criteria neuroanalysis occurs as well as the selection of the most personalized and effective video clip ad variants drawn from many alternatives. Finally, NEAR is found to present the most effective video clips ads for real estate buyers for as long a period as possible, according to Multiple Resource Theory.",

Requirement analysis is a key software engineering task in the whole lifecycle of applications; however, the requirements for monitoring systems within edge computing scenarios are not yet fully established. The goal of the present survey study is therefore threefold: to identify the main challenges in the field of monitoring edge computing applications that are as yet not fully solved; to present a new taxonomy of monitoring requirements for adaptive applications orchestrated upon edge computing frameworks; and to discuss and compare the use of widely-used cloud monitoring technologies to assure the performance of these applications. Our analysis shows that none of existing widely-used cloud monitoring tools yet provides an integrated monitoring solution within edge computing frameworks.

On-demand computing resources of Public Clouds have become a natural host for these MapReduce applications. However, the decision of what type and in what amount computing and storage resources should be rented is still a user’s responsibility. This is not a trivial task particularly when users may have performance constraints such as deadline and have several Cloud product types to choose with the intention of not spending much money. Even though there are several existing scheduling systems, however, most of them are not developed to manage the scheduling of MapReduce applications. That is, they do not consider things such as number of map and reduce tasks that are needed to be scheduled and heterogeneity of Virtual Machines (VMs) available. This paper proposes a novel greedy-based MapReduce application scheduling algorithm (MASA) that considers the user’s constraints in order to minimize cost of renting Cloud resources while considering Service Level Agreements (SLA) in terms of the user given budget and deadline constraints. The simulation results show that MASA can achieve 25–50% cost reduction in comparison to current SLA agnostic methods and there is only 10% performance disparity between MASA and an exhaustive search algorithm.",

SOA uses loosely coupled services that can be reused flexibly to develop different applications. MidSHM is a three-layered middleware with each of the layers containing various services that address issues such as in-network processing, fault tolerance, dynamicity, quality of service etc. We describe operations of various services and use two application examples to illustrate the usability and flexibility of MidSHM.

Furthermore, we address a more general case in which some sensing tasks request multiple sensors to report their measurements simultaneously. We present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation as well as two effective polynomial-time heuristic algorithms, for the corresponding Minimum Energy Multi-sensor task Scheduling (MEMS) problem.

Considering the limitations of computational capabilities and communication resources, it brings more challenges to design privacy-preserving authentication schemes for the resource-constrained wearable devices. In this work, local authentication and remote authentication are respectively designed for cloud assisted wearable devices. In the local authentication mode, hash based selective disclosure mechanism and Chebyshev chaotic map are jointly applied to achieve mutual authentication between a wearable device and a smart phone. In the remote authentication mode, Merkle hash tree based selective disclosure mechanism is designed to improve the structure of data fields in the certificate, and a yoking-proof is established to realize interactions between two wearable devices and a smart phone, and is further transmitted to the cloud server for simultaneous verification. Meanwhile, security formal analysis is performed based on the BAN logic for proving that the proposed remote authentication protocol has theoretical design correctness.

While many papers in security focus on privacy and security technologies, few address the DR process, particularly for a Big Data system. However, all these studies that have investigated DR methods belong to the “single-basket” approach, which means there is only one destination from which to secure the restored data, and mostly use only one type of technology implementation. We propose a “multi-purpose” approach, which allows data to be restored to multiple sites with multiple methods to ensure the organization recovers a very high percentage of data close to 100%, with all sites in London, Southampton and Leeds data recovered. The traditional TCP/IP baseline, snapshot and replication are used with their system design and development explained. We compare performance between different approaches and multi-purpose approach stands out in the event of emergency. Data at all sites in London, Southampton and Leeds can be restored and updated simultaneously. Results show that optimize command can recover 1 TB of data within 650 s and command for three sites can recover 1 TB of data within 1360 s. All data backup and recovery has failure rate of 1.6% and below. All the data centers should adopt multi-purpose approaches to ensure all the data in the Big Data system can be recovered and retrieved without experiencing a prolong downtime and complex recovery processes. We make recommendations for adopting “multi-purpose” approach for data centers, and demonstrate that 100% of data is fully recovered with low execution time at all sites during a hazardous event as described in the paper.",

Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) is a widely used application nowadays. Through the services provided by such e-health systems, doctors can obtain the variation of patients’ conditions and make treatments quickly and accordingly. Recently, researchers have employed the Chebyshev chaotic maps in the authentication process of TMISs. Unfortunately, many kinds of security weaknesses such as off-line guessing attack, destitution of user anonymity and session key agreement happen in relative work. To overcome the disadvantages, we propose a secure remote authentication scheme employing the chaotic maps. We use the formal proof under random oracle model, and the famous verification tool Proverif to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Besides, informal analysis including ten security properties and performance comparison are shown to supplement the security properties. From the formal proof, we can see that the attacker has a negligible probability to crack the scheme over the active guessing attack. The formal verification demonstrates that our scheme can resist the attackers simulated by the tool Proverif. Moreover, we compare our scheme with several recent schemes, and the comparison results show that our scheme reaches the level of security requirements and also has suitable cost in performance. Thus, it is more applicable to telecare medicineenvironments.",

In order to effectively and efficiently collect large amount of data, a Global view of Context-aware Sensing and Collection (GCSC) scheme is proposed for exploiting both local and global of spatial–temporal correlations to perform data collection in cyber–physical cloud system (CPC system). In a GCSC scheme, the size of the representative region varies according to the residual energy of its smart sensor nodes. For areas far from the sink decrease the size of the representative region to keep high accuracy in the collected data, while areas near the Sink increase the size of the representative region to lower energy consumption to ensure efficient energy management. Thus, the accuracy of sensing data and lifetime can be enhanced at same time. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the performance of GCSC scheme is better than the performance in previous studies. Compared with previous schemes, GCSC scheme can improve the data accuracy by 7.56%∼23.16% and increase the network lifetime by more than 11%, also increase energy efficiency as much as 12.39%.",

abstract = "Context
One of the main targets of cyber-attacks is data exfiltration, which is the leakage of sensitive or private data to an unauthorized entity. Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field.
Objective
This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research.
Method
We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers.
Results
We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest).
Conclusion
This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures. We assert the need for developing such an evaluation framework.",

This paper intends to provide two contributions to the current discourse about such advanced approaches to social media exploitation. The first is of practical nature and has to do with assessing the potential and the challenges of a centralized cross-platform approach to social media by government agencies in their policy making processes. The second contribution is of theoretical nature and consists in the development of a multi-dimensional framework for an integrated evaluation of such advanced practices of social media exploitation in public policy making from technological, political and organizational perspectives, drawing from theoretical constructs from different domains. The proposed framework is applied for the evaluation of a pilot consultation campaign conducted in Italy using multiple social media and concerning the large scale application of a telemedicine program.",

abstract = "Crowd sensing campaigns encourage ordinary people to collect and share sensing data by using their carried smart devices. However, new challenges that must be faced have arisen. One of them is how to allocate tasks to the most appropriate participants when considering their different incentive requirements and credibility, in order to best satisfy the quality-of-information (QoI) requirements of multiple concurrent tasks, with different, and limited budget constraints. Another challenge is how to maximize participants’ rewards to encourage them to contribute sensing data continuously. To this end, in this paper, we first propose a crowd sensing system, that aims to address the above two challenges, where the system considers the benefits of both platform and participants. Then, a participant reputation definition and update method is proposed, that takes participant’s willingness and contributed data quality into consideration. Last, we introduce two metrics called “QoI satisfaction” and “Difficulty of Task (DoT)”. The former quantifies how much collected sensing data can satisfy the multi-dimensional task’s QoI requirements in terms of data quality, granularity and quantity, and the later aids participants to choose proper tasks to maximize their rewards. Finally, we compare our proposed scheme with existing methods via extensive simulations based on a real dataset. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.",

In this paper, the device design and development challenges for THz Band are surveyed first. The limitations and possible solutions for high-speed transceiver architectures are highlighted. The challenges for the development of new ultra-broadband antennas and very large antenna arrays are explained. When the devices are finally developed, then they need to communicate in the THz band. There exist many novel communication challenges such as propagation modeling, capacity analysis, modulation schemes, and other physical and link layer solutions, in the THz band which can be seen as a new frontier in the communication research.

We offer a structured approach to the application of the platforms that underpin GaaP, encompassing not only their technical architecture, but also the other essential aspects of market dynamics and organisational form. Based on a review of information systems platforms literature, we develop a Platform Appraisal Framework (PAF) incorporating the various dimensions that characterise business models based on digital platforms. We propose this PAF as a general contribution to the strategy and audit of platform initiatives and more specifically as an assessment framework to provide consistency of thinking in GaaP initiatives. We demonstrate the utility of our PAF by applying it to UK Government platform initiatives over two distinct periods, 1999–2010 and 2010 to the present day, drawing practical conclusions concerning implementation of platforms within the unique and complex environment of the public sector.",

The peculiarities of the Terahertz Band, which is the envisioned frequency band for communication among nano-devices, and the extreme energy limitations of nanosensors, which require the use of nanoscale energy harvesting systems, introduce major challenges in the design of MAC protocols for WNSNs. This paper aims to design energy and spectrum-aware MAC protocols for WNSNs with the objective to achieve fair, throughput and lifetime optimal channel access by jointly optimizing the energy harvesting and consumption processes in nanosensors. Towards this end, the critical packet transmission ratio (CTR) is derived, which is the maximum allowable ratio between the transmission time and the energy harvesting time, below which a nanosensor can harvest more energy than the consumed one, thus achieving perpetual data transmission. Based on the CTR, first, a novel symbol-compression scheduling algorithm, built on a recently proposed pulse-based physical layer technique, is introduced. The symbol-compression solution utilizes the unique elasticity of the inter-symbol spacing of the pulse-based physical layer to allow a large number of nanosensors to transmit their packets in parallel without inducing collisions. In addition, a packet-level timeline scheduling algorithm, built on a theoretical bandwidth-adaptive capacity-optimal physical layer, is proposed with an objective to achieve balanced single-user throughput with infinite network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed simple scheduling algorithms can enable nanosensors to transmit with extremely high speed perpetually without replacing the batteries.",

Performance comparisons on Cloud and non-Cloud systems, deployed for biomedical scientists, have been conducted to identify improvements of efficiency and performance. Prior to the experiments, network latency, file size and job failures were identified as factors which degrade performance and experiments were conducted to understand their impacts. Organizational Sustainability Modeling (OSM) is used before, during and after the experiments to ensure fair comparisons are achieved. OSM defines the actual and expected execution time, risk control rates and is used to understand key outputs related to both Cloud and non-Cloud experiments. Forty experiments on both Cloud and non-Cloud systems were undertaken with two case studies. The first case study was focused on transferring and backing up 10,000 files of 1 GB each and the second case study was focused on transferring and backing up 1000 files 10 GB each. Results showed that first, the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud was lower than on the non-Cloud system. Second, there was more than 99% consistency between the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud while no comparable consistency was found on the non-Cloud system. Third, the improvement in efficiency was higher on the Cloud than the non-Cloud. OSM is the metric used to analyze the collected data and provided synthesis and insights to the data analysis and visualization of the two case studies.",

The adoption of the protocol depends on its relative advantage, and the cost–benefit associated with the use of the protocol is a significant factor affecting a protocol adoption decision. This paper aims at deepening the understanding of the cost–benefits of CoAP and identifies the application scenarios where its use is likely to be economically justifiable. The paper analyzes the costs of using CoAP and HTTP in the Web of Things (WoT) applications, by identifying the components of the total cost of ownership (TCO) model for these applications and by studying the factors affecting individual costs. The use of the model is then demonstrated by means of comparing the TCO of CoAP and HTTP in an environment monitoring application scenario. The results of the analysis suggest that the simpler hardware requirements of CoAP smart objects, as well as the lower communication overhead of the protocol and the resulting reduced power consumption lead to cost advantages in the application scenarios where the smart objects i) are large in volume and/or are deployed in the field, ii) engage in frequent communications with the Web that are charged for on the basis of the volume of the data being transferred, and iii) are sleeping between the communication sessions. The obtained results may be utilized both by the decision-makers considering the adoption of CoAP in specific solutions, as well as by the academics and practitioners involved in the protocol development.",

The approach considers risks in all phases of the business process management lifecycle, from process design, where risks are defined on top of process models, through to process diagnosis, where risks are detected during process execution. The approach has been realized via a distributed, sensor-based architecture. At design-time, sensors are defined to specify risk conditions which when fulfilled, are a likely indicator of negative process states (faults) to eventuate. Both historical and current process execution data can be used to compose such conditions. At run-time, each sensor independently notifies a sensor manager when a risk is detected. In turn, the sensor manager interacts with the monitoring component of a business process management system to prompt the results to process administrators who may take remedial actions. The proposed architecture has been implemented on top of the YAWL system, and evaluated through performance measurements and usability tests with students. The results show that risk conditions can be computed efficiently and that the approach is perceived as useful by the participants in the tests.",

Under hard resource constraints of limited TCAM sizes, we show how to design the optimal and efficient-compressed flow aggregation matrices.

In practical use, partial least squares-based gene selection approaches can obtain gene subsets of good qualities, but are considerably time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to integrate partial least squares based recursive feature elimination (PLS–RFE) with two feature elimination schemes: simulated annealing and square root, respectively, to speed up the feature selection process. Inspired from the strategy of annealing schedule, the two proposed approaches eliminate a number of features rather than one least informative feature during each iteration and the number of removed features decreases as the iteration proceeds. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches, we perform extensive experiments on six publicly available microarray data with three typical classifiers, including Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest-Neighbor and Support Vector Machine, and compare our approaches with ReliefF, PLS and PLS–RFE feature selectors in terms of classification accuracy and running time. Experimental results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches accelerate the feature selection process impressively without degrading the classification accuracy and obtain more compact feature subsets for both two-category and multi-category problems. Further experimental comparisons in feature subset consistency show that the proposed approach with simulated annealing scheme not only has better time performance, but also obtains slightly better feature subset consistency than the one with square root scheme.",

However, the problem of privacy leakage has become a main factor that hinders the further development of LBS. When a LBS user sends queries to the LBS server, the user’s personal privacy in terms of identity and location may be leaked to the attacker. To protect user’s privacy, Niu et al. proposed an algorithm named enhanced-Dummy Location Selection (en-DLS). In this paper, we introduce two attacks to en-DLS, namely long-term statistical attack (LSA) and regional statistical attack (RSA). In the proposed attacks, an attacker can obtain the privacy contents of a user by analyzing LBS historical data, which causes en-DLS to be invalid for user’s privacy protection. Furthermore, this paper proposes a set of privacy protection schemes against both LSA and RSA. For LSA, we propose two protection methods named multiple user name (MNAME) and same user name (SNAME). To solve the regional privacy issue, we divide the map into various regions with different requirements on privacy protection. For this purpose, four levels of protection requirements (PLs) are defined, and true location is protected by allocating a certain number of positions from the dummies according to the location’s PL. Performance analysis and simulation results show that our proposed methods can completely avoid the vulnerabilities of en-DLS to both LSA and RSA, and incur marginal increase of communication overhead and computational cost.",

In this synergy, the cloud service providers provide various services, namely, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) to their clients. In such a provision, both the end parties demand proper auditing so that the resources can be legitimately utilized, and meanwhile the privacy is also preserved. In order to achieve this goal, there is a need for designing an efficient and robust authentication mechanism. Though other existing authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, Open Authorization (OAuth) and OpenID are proposed in the literature, they are vulnerable to various security threats such as replay, online dictionary, offline dictionary, stolen-verifier, impersonation, denial-of-service, privileged-insider and man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, we aim to propose an authentication protocol which overcomes these security loopholes in the existing protocols. In the proposed protocol, a new dynamic password-based two-server authentication and key exchange mechanism is proposed with the help of both public and private key cryptography. Moreover, to achieve strong user anonymity property, a new multi-factor authentication scheme with identity preservation has been also introduced. The security analysis using both the formal security using the broadly-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and the informal security show that the proposed protocol protects several well-known attacks. In addition, the formal security verification using the widely-used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) ensures that the scheme is resilient against replay as well as man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, the performance study contemplates that the overheads incurred in the protocol is reasonable and comparable to that of other existing state-of-art authentication protocols. High security along with comparable overheads make the proposed protocol to be robust and practical for a secure access to the cloud services.",

However, there are some problems in the currently-used measuring instruments. Single-type sensor has limitations to pulse wave acquisition. It is not enough to set three sampling points to detect variation trend of radial artery pulse wave. Adaptation to different wrist surfaces and mutual interference of sensors are neglected. This paper proposes a novel flexible compound pressure sensor array for measuring radial artery pulse wave to overcome the problems mentioned above. Our compound pressure sensor consists of a piezoelectric sensor and a piezoresistive sensor which are used to measure pulse wave and static pressure separately. A bending structure of the sensor could guarantee the signal intensity and prevent the occurrence of inverted waveform. In this study, poroelastic materials are used to achieve flexible connection and decrease interference among sensors. In addition, the amplitude characteristics of pulse wave in radial artery are described and the arrangement and size of the sensor array is designed based on statistical data. Anti-interference, repeatability and validation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the sensor array. The results show that the flexible compound pressure sensor array not only reflects depth information of radial artery pulse wave under a wide range of static pressures, but also has good repeatability and anti-interference performance.",

abstract = "Though most of the current proposed distributed control planes maintain strong consistency among their controllers, this paper argues the strong consistency is not a prerequisite and proposes an Event Coordination System (ECS) that enables an efficient event replaying system and a distributed control plane (DisCon) using this event replaying system to construct eventually consistent global network topologies among its controllers without sacrificing scalability. Our ECS implements a novel request handling procedure that ensures a firstly received write request is firstly multi-casted, notified, and updated, so thus our DisCon can maximally ensure the same time sequence in which topology events get updated at different controllers and the constructed topologies can reflect the real network change in practice. We highlight the major mechanisms used, discuss the major causes of this eventual consistency, estimate the inconsistency window among controllers, and show how this eventual consistency does not make a big difference in supporting network applications. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our ECS and DisCon. The results show our DisCon has a larger event replay throughput and a lower event converging delay than HyperFlow, and larger flow setup rate and lower flow setup delay than most of the current distributed control planes.",

abstract = "Detecting selfish nodes in opportunistic mobile networks can reduce the loss of network resources, thus improve the data delivery performance. Most of existing detection schemes primarily rely on the nodes’ contact records and do not consider their individual and social preferences in their data relaying behavior, which result in long detection time and high communication overhead. In addition, they cannot distinguish the nodes’ selfishness type and degree, which is important because the charge and rewarding mechanisms applied to stimulate different nodes may not be the same. In this paper, we propose a Social-based Watchdog system (SoWatch) in which watchdog nodes analyze messages received from their encountered nodes with respect to their social tie information to identify the nodes’ selfish behavior in message relaying. Meanwhile, the watchdog nodes apply the second-hand watchdog information received from other nodes to improve the detection time and accuracy. Next, we design a reputation system in which watchdog nodes identify selfish nodes based on their direct and indirect watchdog information and distinguish individually and socially selfish nodes. Furthermore, we design a watchdog evaluation module to protect SoWatch against wrong watchdogs disseminated by malicious nodes in which a watchdog node investigates the truthfulness of the indirect watchdogs before applying them. Our experiments using real-world datasets illustrate that SoWatch outperforms a benchmark contact-based watchdog system in terms of detection time by 45% and detection ratio by 10% with less communication overhead.",

This increase is due to the active presence of social media in these mobile devices. The convergence of social media and mobile communication networks generates a considerable amount of trending media contents (e.g., texts, audio, videos, and images) on the Internet while exchanging or sharing contents. However, while exchanging messages or trending contents through social networks, there is a serious concern to identify whether the contents or the images are real or belong to the claimed context using associated descriptive tags. In this paper, we propose a collaborative analysis model to identify if any trending image is altered or modified, and whether the content used to describe it is actually accurate. It is a challenge to provide the desired trending media content in a short time from the vast amount of trending images on the social networks. Online social network environment is heterogeneous in nature, which demands computational Intelligent (CI) techniques to deliver the required media content in an acceptable time to the users. To this end, a collaborative search algorithm is used to utilize the descriptive tags, and user interaction history. The collaboration of tags powers the investigation of a trending images. Accordingly, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed model by performing experiments on the online collected data set using the proposed collaborative analysis model.",

Existing studies on this topic mostly focus on individual movements, considering the trajectories as solo movements. However, a user usually does not visit locations just for the personal interest. The preference of a travel group has significant impacts on the places they visit. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized location prediction approach which further takes into account users’ travel group type. To achieve this goal, we propose a new group pattern discovery approach to extract the travel groups from spatial–temporal trajectories of users. Type of the discovered groups, then, are identified through utilizing the profile information of the group members. The core idea underlying our proposal is the discovery of significant movement patterns of users to capture frequent movements by considering the group types. Finally, the problem of location prediction is formulated as an estimation of the probability of a given user visiting a given location based on his/her current movement and his/her group type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on location prediction based on trajectory pattern mining that investigates the influence of travel group type. By means of a comprehensive evaluation using various datasets, we show that our proposed location prediction framework achieves significantly higher performance than previous location prediction methods.",

abstract = "Cloud computing offers a fast, easy and cost-effective way to configure and allocate computing resources for web applications, such as consoles for smart grid applications, medical records systems, and security management platforms. Although a diverse collection of cloud resources (e.g., servers) is available, choosing the most optimized and cost-effective set of cloud resources for a given web application and set of quality of service (QoS) goals is not a straightforward task. Optimizing cloud resource allocation is a critical task for offering web applications using a software as a service model in the cloud, where minimizing operational cost while ensuring QoS goals are met is critical to meeting customer demands and maximizing profit. Manual load testing with different sets of cloud resources, followed by comparison of test results to QoS goals is tedious and inaccurate due to the limitations of the load testing tools, challenges characterizing resource utilization, significant manual test orchestration effort, and challenges identifying resource bottlenecks. This paper introduces our work using a modeling framework – ROAR (Resource Optimization, Allocation and Recommendation System) to simplify, optimize, and automate cloud resource allocation decisions to meet QoS goals for web applications, including complex multi-tier application distributed in different server groups. ROAR uses a domain-specific language to describe the configuration of the web application, the APIs to benchmark and the expected QoS requirements (e.g., throughput and latency), and the resource optimization engine uses model-based analysis and code generation to automatically deploy and load test the application in multiple resource configurations in order to derive a cost-optimal resource configuration that meets the QoS goals.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel disease-specific feature selection method which consists of a one-versus-one (OvO) features ranking stage and a feature search stage wrapped in the same OvO-rule support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier. The proposed method differs from traditional approaches in that it focuses on the selection of effective feature subsets for distinguishing a class from others by making OvO comparison. The electrocardiograms (ECG) from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH-AR) are used to evaluate the proposed feature selection method. The ECG features adopted include inter-beat and intra-beat intervals, amplitude morphology, area morphology and morphological distance. Following the recommendation of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), all the heartbeat samples of MIT-BIH-AR are grouped into four classes, namely, normal or bundle branch block (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). The division of training and testing data complies with the inter-patient schema. Experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed feature selection method is 86.66%, outperforming those methods without feature selection. The sensitivities for the classes N, S, V and F are 88.94%, 79.06%, 85.48% and 93.81% respectively, and the corresponding positive predictive values are 98.98%, 35.98%, 92.75% and 13.74% respectively. In terms of geometric means of sensitivity and positive predictivity, the proposed method also demonstrates better performance than other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.",

In this paper, we present PACL (Privacy-Aware Contextual Localizer) model, which can learn user’s contextual location just by passively monitoring user’s network traffic. PACL can discern a set of vital attributes (statistical and application-based) from user’s network traffic, and predict user’s contextual location with a very high accuracy. We design and evaluate PACL using real-world network traces of over 1700 users with over 100GB of total data. Our results show that PACL, when built using the Bayesian Network machine learning algorithm, can predict user’s contextual location with the accuracy of around 89%.",

However, the existing algorithms often utilize only one distance function to evaluate the distance between data items on each feature, which cannot deal with datasets with complex inner structures. In this paper, a composite kernel space (CKS) is constructed based on a set of basis kernels and a novel framework of soft subspace clustering is proposed by integrating distance metric learning in the CKS. Two soft subspace clustering algorithms, i.e., entropy weighting fuzzy clustering in CKS for kernel space (CKS-EWFC-K) and feature space (CKS-EWFC-F) are thus developed. In both algorithms, the prototype in the feature space is mapped into the CKS by multiple simultaneous mappings, one mapping for each cluster, which is distinct from existing kernel-based clustering algorithms. By evaluating the distance on each feature in the CKS, both CKS-EWFC-K and CKS-EWFC-F learn the distance function adaptively during the clustering process. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms in general outperform classical clustering algorithms and are immune to ineffective kernels and irrelevant features in soft subspace.",

Existing designs of clock-trees have to assume a given time-invariant worst-case temperature map but cannot deal with a set of temperature maps under a set of workloads. For robust clock-tree synthesis considering temperature uncertainty, this paper presents a new problem formulation: Stochastic PErturbation based Clock Optimization (SPECO). In SPECO algorithm, one nominal clock-tree is pre-synthesized with determined merging points. The impact from the stochastic temperature variation is modeled by perturbation (or small physical displacement) of merging points to offset the induced skews. Because the implementation cost is reduced but the design complexity is increased, the determination of optimal positions of perturbed merging points requires a computationally efficient algorithm. In this paper, one Non-Monte-Carlo (NMC) method is deployed to generate skew and skew variance by one-time analysis when a set of stochastic temperature maps is already provided. Moreover, one principal temperature–map analysis is developed to reduce the design complexity by clustering correlated merging points based on the subspace of the correlation matrix. As a result, the new merging points can be efficiently determined level by level with both skew and its variance reduced. The experimental results show that our SPECO algorithm can effectively reduce the clock-skew and its variance under a number of workloads with minimized wire-length overhead and computational cost.",

Different types of research methodologies have been proposed to solve this problem; hence, there are varied solutions. Most of the work on OSNs has focused on trust, distrust to detect and preventing these types of attacks. Some researchers have found that a suspected node can generate private/public keys to prevent its identity from being stolen by an adversary; however, they have not explained how these keys are generated and managed. We propose a new and efficient centralized key management protocol to prevent Sybil attack and to provide a secure communication service among users in OSNs. The core tenet of this method is the existence of a ‘roadblock’ that any user intending to join a group must go through, which includes a task that only a human user can accomplish. Hence, automatically controlled accounts are prevented from joining, and the group will consist only of users that have been confirmed as genuine. The mechanism is very effective in recognizing bot accounts, which enables it to guard the network against malicious behavior by fake accounts.",
