abstract = "This research presents the results of an exploratory study of how organisations operating in the Internet of Things (IoT) industry are building and innovating their business model (BM). Using an explorative sequential approach through the multiple-case study method, we apply the “Canvas BM” framework to explore the BM of three companies operating in IoT industry, namely Intel, Solair, and Apio. The paper finds the most important building blocks - key activities, key resources, and value proposition - and most critical related factors enabling IoT-oriented organisations to create and capture value. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the main difference in the processes of BM building and innovation depend on the different capabilities and competencies possessed by organisations. This study therefore advances the theoretical understanding of the critical factors for the value creation process in the IoT industry's organisations and offers interesting implications for management theory and practice.",

This paper presents the ransomware attacks and security concerns in IoT. We initially discuss the rise of ransomware attacks and outline the associated challenges. Then, we investigate, report, and highlight the state-of-the-art research efforts directed at IoT from a security perspective. A taxonomy is devised by classifying and categorizing the literature based on important parameters (e.g., threats, requirements, IEEE standards, deployment level, and technologies). Furthermore, a few credible case studies are outlined to alert people regarding how seriously IoT devices are vulnerable to threats. We enumerate the requirements that need to be met for securing IoT. Several indispensable open research challenges (e.g., data integrity, lightweight security mechanisms, lack of security software’s upgradability and patchability features, physical protection of trillions of devices, privacy, and trust) are identified and discussed. Several prominent future research directions are provided.",

abstract = "Trusted transmission of data in sensing layer is the basis of security of Internet of Things so in data transmission process the trust of sensing node needs real-time confirmation and the track of the node is also needed. But the most current remote attestation mechanisms cannot achieve real-time trust attestation of sensing nodes and cannot track the node, if the node is an untrusted one, and these mechanisms also have poor environmental adaptability, so the current remote attestation mechanisms are not suitable for the sensing layer nodes in the Internet of Things. To solve the above problems, a remote attestation mechanism for the sensing layer nodes in the Internet of Things is presented in this paper. Firstly, the formal description of the sensor nodes is given; secondly, based on the formal description, a real-time trust measurement for the sensing nodes is proposed and the real-time trust measurement for the sensing nodes is realized; thirdly by encapsulating the properties and trust value of sensing node, the real-time tracing of the trust of nodes are realized in data transmission process. The security of this mechanism is proved in the standard model, meanwhile, this mechanism will not expose the privacy of nodes in the process of attestation, and it can trace the untrusted nodes. The simulation experiment shows that this mechanism can resist the attacks to the sensing nodes and can effectively improve the trust rate of data transmission, and this mechanism has good dynamic adaptability to network environment. This mechanism is simple and efficient, meanwhile the mechanism is flexible and easy to implement.",

This study proposes a two-stage patent analysis based on the quality function development (QFD) method which adopts customer requirement and technology viewpoints to explore key technologies. This methodology can recognize the specific technologies with development potential in the eyewear industry, and identify holders of key relevant patents. This study finds that consumers value functions including motion tracking, reminders, eye state detection, and non-eye disease detection. Key technologies with development potential for satisfying customer demand include eyewear, communications protocols, and sensors. Thus, embedding micron-scale sensors directly into contact lenses to monitor user physiological data can satisfy customer demand and is considered as emerging technology in the smart eyewear industry. Furthermore, patent portfolios of these technologies vary among different countries and regions, with the US and EU focusing on eye tracking, motion tracking, and identity verification, while China focuses on eye fatigue detection, distance measurement, and wireless frequency technologies. Visualizations of overall research results can benefit eyewear-related patent holders, eyewear manufacturers and smart wearable manufacturers to build their patent portfolio strategies on the basis of regional or country considerations.",

abstract = "Background
The novel technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) connects objects to the Internet and its most advanced applications refine obtained data for the user. We propose that Internet of Things technology can be used to promote basic nursing care in the hospital environment by improving the quality of care and patient safety.
Objectives
To introduce the concept of Internet of Things to nursing audience by exploring the state of the art of Internet of Things based technology for basic nursing care in the hospital environment.
Data sources and review methods
Scoping review methodology following Arksey & O’Malley’s stages from one to five were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of current literature. We searched eight databases using predefined search terms. A total of 5030 retrievals were found which were screened for duplications and relevancy to the study topic. 265 papers were chosen for closer screening of the abstracts and 93 for full text evaluation. 62 papers were selected for the review. The constructs of the papers, the Internet of Things based innovations and the themes of basic nursing care in hospital environment were identified.
Results
Most of the papers included in the review were peer-reviewed proceedings of technological conferences or articles published in technological journals. The Internet of Things based innovations were presented in methodology papers or tested in case studies and usability assessments. Innovations were identified in several topics in four basic nursing care activities: comprehensive assessment, periodical clinical reassessment, activities of daily living and care management.
Conclusions
Internet of Things technology is providing innovations for the use of basic nursing care although the innovations are emerging and still in early stages. Internet of things is yet vaguely adopted in nursing. The possibilities of the Internet of Things are not yet exploited as well as they could. Nursing science might benefit from deeper involvement in engineering research in the area of health.",

When combining them with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, a plethora of services can be devised. Thanks to IoT, several approaches have been proposed to apply user data, and particularly ElectroCardioGram (ECG) signals, for biometric authentication. One step further is achieving Continuous Authentication (CA), i.e., ensuring that the user remains the same during a certain period. The hardness of this task varies with the attacker characterization, that is, the amount of information about the attacker that is available to the authentication system. In this vein, we explore different ECG-based CA mechanisms for known, blind-modelled and unknown attacker settings. Our results show that, under certain configuration, 99.5 % of true positive rate can be achieved for a blind-modelled attacker, 93.5 % for a known set of attackers and 91.8 % for unknown ones.",

An important property of the proposed approach is that the proposed ownership transfer mechanism ensures the security of both the RFID tagged objects and the object owners.

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized by heterogeneous technologies, which concur to the provisioning of innovative services in different application domains. Introducing efficient mechanisms for collecting, processing, and delivering data generated by sensors, medical equipment, wearable devices, and humans, is a key enabling factor for advanced healthcare services. The adoption of IoT in smart health, however, opens the doors to some security concerns. In fact, by considering the confidentiality and sensitivity of medical data, a healthcare system must fulfill advanced access control procedures with strict security and data quality requirements. To this end, a flexible policy enforcement framework, based on the IoT paradigm, is defined hereby. It is able to face security and quality threats in dynamic large scale and heterogeneous smart hearth environments. As a key feature of the proposed framework, cross-domain policies have been defined using a specification language based on XML. In this way, it becomes possible to ease the management of interactions across different realms and policy conflicts. Moreover, to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, a running example, based on a smart health application, is detailed throughout the manuscript. This helps to highlight the different facets of the conceived enforcement framework. A preliminary performance analysis also demonstrates its feasibility in large scale environments.",

To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented to experimentally analyze and compare the resource efficiency of different SAT verification approaches in terms of a number of performance metrics, including computation and communication overhead.",

In the fast forwarding IoT paradigm, hundreds of billions of things are estimated to be deployed which would give rise to an enormous amount of data. Cloud computing has been the prevailing choice for controlling the connected things and the data, and providing intelligence based on the data. But response time and network load are on the higher side for cloud based solutions. Recently, edge computing is gaining growing attention to overcome this by employing rule-based intelligence. However, requirements of rules do not scale well with the proliferation of things. At the same time, rules fail in uncertain events and only offer pre-assumed intelligence. To counter this, this paper proposes a novel idea of leveraging the belief-network with the edge computing to utilize as an IoT edge-controller the aim of which is to offer low-level intelligence for IoT applications. This low-level intelligence along with cloud-based intelligence form the distributed intelligence in the IoT realm. Furthermore, a learning approach similar to reinforcement learning has been proposed. The approach, i.e. enabling a Future IoT Controller (FITC) has been verified with a simulated SmartHome scenario which proves the feasibility of the low-level intelligence in terms of reducing rules domination, faster response time and prediction through learning experiences at the edge.",

COMFIT is composed of two different modules: (1) the App Development Module, a model-driven architecture (MDA) infrastructure, and (2) the App Management and Execution Module, a module that contains cloud-based web interface connected to a server hosted in the cloud with compilers and simulators for developing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The App Development Module allows the developers to design IoT applications using high abstraction artifacts (models), which are tailored to either the application perspective or the network perspective, thus creating a separation between these two concerns. As models can be automatically transformed into code through the App Development Module, COMFIT creates an environment where there is no need of additional configurations to properly compile or simulate the generated code, integrating the development lifecycle of IoT applications into a single environment partially hosted in the client side and partially in the cloud. In its current version, COMFIT supports two operating systems, namely Contiki and TinyOS, which are widely used in IoT devices. COMFIT supports automatic code generation, execution of simulations, and code compilation of applications for these platforms with low development effort. Finally, COMFIT is able to interact with IoT-lab, an open testbed for IoT applications, which allows the developers to test their applications with different configurations without the need of using local IoT devices. Several evaluations were performed to assess COMFIT’s key features in terms of development effort, quality of generated code, and scalability.",

Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).",

To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications. Our survey is different from existing surveys in that we focus on recent advances and ongoing research directions in cognitive radio in the context of Machine to Machine and Internet of Things. We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity. This paper intends to help new researchers entering the domain of CR and IoT by providing a comprehensive survey on recent advances.",

To help interested researchers contribute to this research area, an overview of the IoT security roadmap overview is presented in this paper based on a novel cognitive and systemic approach. The role of each component of the approach is explained and interactions with the other main components, and their impact on the overall. A case study is presented to highlight the components and interactions of the systemic and cognitive approach. Then, security questions about privacy, trust, identification, and access control are discussed.

In this sense, key features such as traceability, unique identification, energy efficiency, heterogeneity of devices, scalability and ubiquity, are necessary at the network structure for efficient performance of IoT applications. As a single technology, it is not capable to provide all these features, then, the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) arises as an important approach for these solutions. In this paper, a framework aiming to provide the network features required for IoT applications is proposed, considering the challenges that comes from the integration of these two technologies. In this framework, two components are considered, the Fuzzy Q-Algorithm and the Fuzzy System-Based Route Classifier. The former comprises a fuzzy system to enhance an anti-collision protocol for RFID, and the latter is a fuzzy system that classifies routes and assists routing protocols in applications that use WSNs and RFID. Experiments show that framework provides the following benefits: improves the performance of RFID tags identification, lowers packet loss rates, decreases the nodes energy consumption, and shows improvements in network load balancing. Moreover, these benefits provide greater energy efficiency and quality of service for IoT applications.",

The CIoT systems allow a large number of IoT devices to be connected through the random-access procedure, but the concurrent accesses of the massive devices make this procedure heavily competitive. In this article, we present an effective time-division random-access scheme built upon the coverage levels (CLs), where each CIoT device is assigned a CL and categorized based on its radio-channel quality. In our scheme, the random-access loads of device groups having different CLs are distributed into different time periods, which greatly relaxes instantaneous contention and improves random-access performance. To assess the performance of our scheme, we also introduce a mathematical model that expresses and analyzes the states and behaviors of CIoT devices using the Markov chain. Mathematical analysis and simulation results show that our scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme (without time-division control) in terms of collision probability, succeeding access rate, and access-blocking probability.",

Compared to Everything-as-a-Service (*aaS), resources are categorized into computational, consumed, and produced, have trackable lifecycles as per their respective category, and are customized in order to consider the characteristics of future resource-based collaborative applications to develop. From a capacity perspective, a computational resource processes data, a produced resource abstracts data, and a consumed resource captures data. Along with their capacities, resources expose methods that other resources and/or applications’ stakeholders call. The proper call of methods is ensured through restrictions like limited and non-shareable. This paper exemplifies the *aaR paradigm with a case study that revolves around the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the healthcare domain. The case study is implemented in a RESTful fashion along with some standard Web technologies and protocols.

The work is evaluated in a number of research projects in the domain of e-health; we conclude that the GUI language is practically viable for building professional-grade GUIs.

It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts.",

We classified the IDSs proposed in the literature according to the following attributes: detection method, IDS placement strategy, security threat and validation strategy. We also discussed the different possibilities for each attribute, detailing aspects of works that either propose specific IDS schemes for IoT or develop attack detection strategies for IoT threats that might be embedded in IDSs.",

The adoption of IoT in medical care field will bring great convenient to both doctors and patients for effective illness monitoring and diagnosis. Due to the high value of medical data and the openness character of health IoT, the protection of data confidentiality is of crucial importance. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed secure data management with keyword search system for health IoT. Since the patients are usually managed by diverse medical institutions, the proposed system enables distributed access control of protected health information (PHI) among different medical domains. On the other hand, the accumulation of electronic health records (EHR) makes effective data retrieval a challenge task. Our scheme could provide efficient keyword search function on cross-domain PHI. For the resource limited devices in health IoT, it is an essential requirement to design lightweight algorithms in the secure data management system. The proposed system realizes lightweight data encryption, lightweight keyword trapdoor generation and lightweight data recovery, which leaves very few computations to user's terminal. The security of this system is reduced to the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The comparison analysis is made between this scheme and other existing systems. The extensive experiments on both laptop and smart phone platforms show that the proposed scheme has greatly improved the computation efficiency and requires much less communication cost.",

First, this methodology decomposes SIoT into multiple ESs, determines the state variables of those ESs, and dissects the interactions between them. Second, it develops a nonlinear dynamic model along with algorithms revealing the bottom-up operation mechanisms of SIoT and identifying the threshold conditions in integration continuum for the SIoT to achieve a robust operation. Finally, extensive numerical experiments and an application involving manufacturing supply chains are given to illustrate this new methodology. The overall results suggest that interoperability and low incompatibility outperform high incompatibility and tightly-coupled integration in improving the robustness of SIoT under the CM paradigm.",

Other constraints such as limited computational ability and power, and small storage of some embedded devices make implementation of complex cryptographic algorithms difficult. So far there has been no established industrial standard to address this problem. Recently, Kalra and Sood, and subsequently Chang et al. attempted to solve the authentication problem by proposing key agreement schemes for IoT devices. However, the security of their schemes were unproven. In this paper we demonstrate that these schemes are insecure. We extend upon their work to present a scheme that enables embedded devices to communicate securely with a server on an IoT network. We prove the security of this scheme using formal methods and demonstrate this under the intractability of some well-defined hard problems. We also discuss some practical aspects related to the implementation of the scheme.",

In healthcare in particular, the use of IoT concepts and technologies make diagnose and monitor more convenient for the physicians and patients. As mobile applications solutions are widely accepted because the easy to use, secure healthcare service is a new demand for mobile solutions. To protect the privacy and security for patients in the domain of healthcare towards IoT, a systematic mechanism is needed. This article proposes a novel security and privacy mechanism for Health Internet of Things (Health-IoT) to solve above problems. Health-IoT is promising for both traditional healthcare industry and the information and communication technologies (ICTs) industry. From the view of trustworthiness, interactive vector was proposed to communicate the end-devices and application brokers. The aim is to establish a trust IoT application market (IAM), feature of application in marketplace and behavior of applications on end-devices can be exchanged in mathematical value to establish the connection between market and users.",

These services require timely and accurate event delivery, but such in-situ deployments are often limited by the coverage of sensing/communication infrastructures.

Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30%–60% improvement in overall data utility, 30% reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability.",

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE’s core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart.

Several edge computing technologies originating from different backgrounds have been emerging to decrease latency, improve SE, and support the massive machine type of communication. This paper comprehensively presents a tutorial of three typical edge computing technologies, including the mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing. In particular, the standardization efforts, principles, architectures, and applications for these three technologies are summarized and compared.

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

The paper discusses the design, implementation, and evaluation of a sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) network technology for improving the management of restaurant food waste (RFW) in the city of Suzhou, China. This IoT-based system encompasses the generation, collection, transportation and final disposal of RFW. The Suzhou case study comprised four steps: (1) examination of the required functionality of an IoT-enabled system in the specific context of Suzhou; (2) configuration of the system architecture, both software and hardware components, according to the identified functionality; (3) installation of the components of the IoT system at the facilities of the stakeholders across the RFW generation-collection-transportation-disposal value chain; and (4) evaluation of the performance of the entire system, based on data from three years of operation. The results show that the system had a strong impact. Positive results include: (1) better management of RFW generation, as evidenced by a 20.5% increase in RFW collected via official channels and a 207% increase in the number of RFW generators under official contract; (2) better law enforcement in response to RFW malpractice, enabled by the monitoring capabilities of the IoT system; and (3) an overall reduction in illicit RFW activities and better process optimization across the RFW value chain. Negative results include: (1) Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags need to be renewed often due to the frequent handling of waste bins, thus increasing operating costs; (2) dynamic/automatic weight sensors had a higher degree of error than the more time-consuming static/manual weighing method; and (3) there were disagreements between the city’s government agencies about how to interpret data from the IoT system, which led to some inefficiencies in management. In sum, the Suzhou IoT system enabled data-driven management of RFW and had a net positive impact for the stakeholders involved.",

Additionally, DDIPCs mediate the relationship between the use of the IoTs and operational agility. By persuasively building these links based on theoretical arguments and testing them by using a unique dataset, this study contributes to the deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the use of the IoTs and DDIPCs strengthen operational agility.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm in the ICT sector and it is at the center of many current political and economic debates. Scholars, executives, and policymakers are becoming increasingly interested in understanding how to turn the IoT into reality, since various technological constraints (e.g., standardization and interoperability) limit the possibility of realizing an inclusive IoT information network. These constraints are exacerbated by the lack of a clear picture of the innovation dynamics and technology evolution of the IoT. This paper seeks to address this gap by mapping the development of IoT technologies. In particular, we have collected 61,972 IoT patents filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty in the period 2000–2012. We analyze temporal trends, cross-country dynamics and identity of the applicants. Moreover, we provide insights about the development of the most relevant IoT technologies by looking at triadic patent families.",

In order to reduce the traffic load and to avoid a single point of failure at the controller node, we distribute the controllers role by introducing three levels of control: Principal Controller (PC), Secondary Controller (SC), the Local Controller (LC). The PC has a global view of the network infrastructure which is not the case of SC where it focuses only on one network technology. The LC acts locally by managing and relaying signaling messages from ordinary nodes to the SC. In order to select the LC nodes, we propose a Distributed Local Controller Connected Dominating Set algorithm (DLC-CDS). The DLC-CDS is a distributed algorithm with single phase and supports the dynamic network topology. The selection strategy of DLC-CDS is based on an important function named score, which is computed using the fuzzy logic and it depends on several parameters such as: the connectivity degree, the average link quality, and the rank. The performance of the proposed DLC-CDS are evaluated and compared with another solution named Distributed Single Phase-CDS (DSP-CDS) using many scenarios with different parameters: the node density and the radio range. The obtained results show that the DLC-CDS converges rapidly with a minimum CDS size compared to a DSP-CDS.",

Considering the characteristics of sensor nodes, including limited resource, limited communication capability, and an uncontrollable environment, location privacy protection is a challenging problem for WSNs. In this paper, we propose a source location protection protocol based on dynamic routing to address the source location privacy problem. We introduce a dynamic routing scheme that aims at maximizing paths for data transmission. The proposed scheme first randomly chooses an initial node from the boundary of the network. Every package will travel a greedy route and a subsequent directed route before reaching the sink. Theoretical and experimental results show that our scheme can preserve source location privacy and defeat various privacy disclosure attacks (eavesdropping attack, hop-by-hop trace back attack, and direction-oriented attack) without affecting the network lifetime.",

Using an ethnographic observation, the study first characterizes the quality of service (QoS) and subjective evaluations to compare QoS with QoE. Then, a user survey is conducted to identify user behavior factors in personal informatics. Finally, a user experience model is proposed, conceptualizing QoE specific to personal informatics and highlighting its relationships with other factors. The model establishes a foundation for IoT service categories through a heuristic quality assessment tool from a user-centered perspective. The results overall provide the groundwork for developing future IoT services with QoE requirements and for dimensioning the underlying network provisioning infrastructures, particularly with regard to wearable technologies.",

With the development of computer vision and pattern recognition technologies, face has been used as a high-security identification and identity authentication method which has been deployed in various applications. Face identification can ensure the consistency between individual in physical-space and his/her identity in cyber-space during the physical–cyber space mapping. However, face is a non-code and unstructured identifier. With the increase of applications in current big data environment, the characteristic of face identification will result in the growing demands for computation power and storage capacity. In this paper, we propose a face identification and resolution scheme based on cloud computing to solve the above problem. The face identification and resolution system model is presented to introduce the processes of face identifier generation and matching. Then, parallel matching mechanism and cloud computing-based resolution framework are proposed to efficiently resolve face image, control personal data access and acquire individual’s identity information. It makes full use of the advantages of cloud computing to effectively improve computation power and storage capacity. The experimental result of prototype system indicates that the proposed scheme is practically feasible and can provide efficient face identification and resolution service.",

The monitoring of environmental conditions of cities can help to adapt the indoor locations of the cities in order to be more comfortable for people who stay there. A way to improve the indoor conditions is an efficient temperature control, however, it depends on many factors like the different combinations of outdoor temperature and humidity. Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a value according to other value. There are many more factors to take into consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot be used. Many problems cannot be solved with a set of binary solutions and we need a new way of development. Fuzzy logic is able to interpret many states, more than two states, giving to computers the capacity to react in a similar way to people. In this paper we will propose a new approach to control the temperature using the Internet of Things together its platforms and fuzzy logic regarding not only the indoor temperature but also the outdoor temperature and humidity in order to save energy and to set a more comfortable environment for their users. Finally, we will conclude that the fuzzy approach allows us to achieve an energy saving around 40% and thus, save money.",

The requirement for scalability, due to the possibly huge amount of involved sensors and devices, and the heterogeneous scenarios that might occur, impose resorting to sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques. In particular, multi-level simulation is regarded as a main framework that allows simulating large-scale IoT environments while keeping high levels of detail, when it is needed. We consider a use case based on the deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level simulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of simulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator (based on OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area, which allows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on this use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc wireless networking technologies do represent a principle tool to deploy smart services over decentralized countrysides. Moreover, the performance evaluation confirms the viability of utilizing multi-level simulation for simulating large scale IoT environments.",

The preliminary results show that existing approaches perform reasonably well but further extension is required for IoTSRS.

Such attention to the things due to several factors, including: the modern understanding of space and time, the expansion of the current “real” crisis idealistic philosophical ideas, the reorientation of phenomenology. In a situation of rapid development of information technologies there is such a phenomenon as the “Internet of things”, which captures not only the conjugation of human individuals in the information network, but also systems and hardware devices that can often go without human intervention.

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms—and underperforms—the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.",

The results (Pearson´s r = 0.939, p = 0.000) show that relative to static information about price, expiry date, quality, and offers given, the real-time information was the most salient stimulus when choosing fresh salmon. Moreover, quality ratings by other customers were the most salient stimuli among real-time information, followed by an offer based on a product in the shopping cart, real-time expiry date, and real-time price. These findings contribute both to researchers and managers within grocery retailing who want to understand how IoT can be used in a way that creates value for the customers.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) has radically transformed the world; currently, every device can be connected to the Internet and provide valuable information for decision-making. In spite of the fast evolution of technologies accompanying the grow of IoT, we are still faced with the challenge of providing a service oriented architecture, which facilitates the inclusion of data coming together from several IoT devices, data delivery among a system's agents, real-time data processing and service provision to users. Furthermore, context-aware data processing and architectures still pose a challenge, in spite of being key requirements in order to get stronger IoT architectures. To face this challenge, we propose a COLLaborative ConText Aware Service Oriented Architecture (COLLECT), which facilitates both the integration of IoT heterogeneous domain context data — through the use of a light message broker — and easy data delivery among several agents and collaborative participants in the system — making use of an enterprise service bus —. In addition, this architecture provides real-time data processing thanks to the use of a complex event processing engine as well as services and intelligent decision-making procedures to users according to the needs of the domain in question. As a result, COLLECT has a great impact on context-aware decentralized and collaborative reasoning for IoT, promoting context-aware intelligent decision making in such scope. Since context-awareness is key for a wide range of recommender and intelligent systems, the presented novel solution improves decision making in a large number of fields where such systems require to promptly process a variety of ubiquitous collaborative and context-aware data.",

However, the resource-constrained nature of sensors severely restricts the cryptographic algorithms and protocols that can be used in such platforms. Such restrictions apply especially to authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocols for bootstrapping keys between authorized nodes: in traditional networks, such schemes involve the transmission of quite large certificates and the execution of memory- and processing-intensive cryptographic algorithms, which are not suitable for WSNs. Whereas lightweight WSN-oriented schemes also exist, most of them focus on small deployments where key-escrow is possible (i.e., a fully trusted authority knows the private keys of all nodes). Aiming to identify AKA solutions suitable for the IoT scenario, in this article we assess lightweight and escrow-free schemes, evaluating their security and performance in terms of processing time and energy consumption in the TelosB platform. Besides proving that some very efficient schemes are actually flawed, we show that the combination of SMQV (strengthened-Menezes-Qu-Vanstone) with implicit certificates leads to a secure and lightweight AKA scheme.",

To deal with these overheads, novel metrics, and methods are introduced in an attempt to maximize the capabilities and widen acceptance/usage provided by the Internet of Things. Without losing its generality, the method discussed is experimentally evaluated in the paradigm of the Health domain. The focus is on the need for an overview of available data formats and transmission methods and selection of the optimal combination, which can result to reduction/minimization of costs.

Yet, the wide adoption of this promising vision, especially for application areas such as pervasive health care, assisted living, and smart cities, is hindered by severe privacy concerns of the individual users. Hence, user acceptance is a critical factor to turn this vision into reality. To address this critical factor and thus realize the cloud-based Internet of Things for a variety of different application areas, we present our comprehensive approach to privacy in this envisioned setting. We allow an individual user to enforce all her privacy requirements before any sensitive data is uploaded to the cloud, enable developers of cloud services to integrate privacy functionality already into the development process of cloud services, and offer users a transparent and adaptable interface for configuring their privacy requirements.",

This paper presents a HealthIIoT-enabled monitoring framework, where ECG and other healthcare data are collected by mobile devices and sensors and securely sent to the cloud for seamless access by healthcare professionals. Signal enhancement, watermarking, and other related analytics will be used to avoid identity theft or clinical error by healthcare professionals. The suitability of this approach has been validated through both experimental evaluation, and simulation by deploying an IoT-driven ECG-based health monitoring service in the cloud.",

This innovative concept enables a physical object to represent itself in the digital world. There have been a lot of speculations and future forecasts about these physical objects connected with the Internet, however, most of them lack secure features and are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. Miniature sensor nodes, embedded in these physical objects, limit the support for computationally complex and resource-consuming secured algorithms. In this paper, we propose a lightweight mutual authentication scheme for the real-world physical objects of an IoT environment. It is a payload-based encryption scheme which uses a simple four-way handshake mechanism to verify the identities of the participating objects. The real-world objects communicate with each other using the client–server interaction model. Our proposed scheme uses the lightweight features of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to enable the clients to observe resources residing on the server, in an energy-efficient manner. We use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with a key length of 128 bits, to establish a secured session for resource observation. We evaluate our scheme for a real-world scenario using NetDuino Plus 2 boards. Our scheme is computationally efficient, incurs less connection overhead and at the same time, provides a robust defence against various attacks such as, resource exhaustion, Denial-of-Service, replay and physical tampering.",

The proclaimed goal of metadata collection is to support the quality of service, thus enhancing the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To most users, it is not obvious that metadata express people’s lives to a large degree. Traditionally, security has focused on protecting communication content rather than the metadata associated with it. This provides a thin layer of privacy protection. Thus, a demand exists for privacy-preserving technologies that prevent metadata collection and aggregation. This paper focuses on a service’s ability to observe communication metadata that can be exploited to learn users’ identities and behavior patterns. Thus, a novel system, Misty Clouds, is proposed as a platform for creating anonymous Internet connections to address both security and performance issues. The performance evaluation shows that the desired level of anonymity can be achieved with tolerable performance overheads. Through a comparison analysis, it is shown that the new algorithm outperforms an existing algorithm, Tor. Additionally, the features that can facilitate the growth of Misty Clouds into a holistic privacy-preserving platform are discussed. Furthermore, a user survey was conducted to study users’ perceptions and attitudes.",

Technologically this concept is clear, and several smart applications are currently under development (see e.g. iCore, Hydra, Confidence or IoT@Work projects). However, the business perspective of information as an asset in its own right remains an open issue. To handle this issue we apply an originally value-based requirement technique, e3-value, to model value creation and value exchange within an e-business network of multiple business actors. Using this approach the business activity can be reduced to its core elements, which in the simplest case comprise the value proposition, distribution channels and the customers of the company, explaining how a multi-actor network creates, distributes and consumes value by production of a good or providing a service.",

abstract = "We are experiencing an abundance of Internet-of-Things (IoT) middleware solutions that provide connectivity for sensors and actuators to the Internet. To gain a widespread adoption, these middleware solutions, referred to as platforms, have to meet the expectations of different players in the IoT ecosystem, including device providers, application developers, and end-users, among others. In this article, we evaluate a representative sample of these platforms, both proprietary and open-source, on the basis of their ability to meet the expectations of different IoT users. The evaluation is thus more focused on how ready and usable these platforms are for IoT ecosystem players, rather than on the peculiarities of the underlying technological layers. The evaluation is carried out as a gap analysis of the current IoT landscape with respect to (i) the support for heterogeneous sensing and actuating technologies, (ii) the data ownership and its implications for security and privacy, (iii) data processing and data sharing capabilities, (iv) the support offered to application developers, (v) the completeness of an IoT ecosystem, and (vi) the availability of dedicated IoT marketplaces. The gap analysis aims to highlight the deficiencies of today’s solutions to improve their integration to tomorrow’s ecosystems. In order to strengthen the finding of our analysis, we conducted a survey among the partners of the Finnish IoT program, counting over 350 experts, to evaluate the most critical issues for the development of future IoT platforms. Based on the results of our analysis and our survey, we conclude this article with a list of recommendations for extending these IoT platforms in order to fill in the gaps.",

A major technical challenge however is to make these numerous objects interact seamlessly with each other. The latest works related to concepts, such as Web of Things or Social Web of Things, partly address the issue. In our paper we further investigate the topic and point out several problems that need to be efficiently solved for the Internet of Things to work on large scale numbers. One of the main tasks is to make devices easily discoverable. Thus, an efficient way to handle and store their metadata is required. Another problem is connected with providing different models of inter-device communication, asynchronous being the most important, as many of today's widely used web standards were not designed for it. Finally, we propose a general cloud-based IoT architecture aimed at solving the above-described problems.",

Complemented by monitored contextual information, e.g. machine power usage, it can provide smart information, such as which components have been machined by a worn or damaged tool. Although sensor based Internet of Things (IoT) positioning has been developed, there are still key challenges when benchmarked approaches concentrate on precision, using computationally expensive filtering and iterative statistical or heuristic algorithms, as a trade-off for timeliness and scalability. Precise but high-cost hardware systems and invasive infrastructures of wired devices also pose implementation issues in the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Wireless, self-powered sensors are integrated in this paper, using a novel, communication-economical RSSI/ToF ranging method in a proposed semantic IIoT architecture. Annotated data collection ensures accessibility, scalable knowledge discovery and flexibility to changes in consumer and business requirements. Deployed at a working indoor industrial facility the system demonstrated comparable RMS ranging accuracy (ToF 6m and RSSI 5.1m with 40m range) to existing systems tested in non-industrial environments and a 12.6–13.8m mean positioning accuracy.",

Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudIoT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudIoT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudIoT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms–both proprietary and open source–and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet.",

abstract = "Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.",

Recently, the solution that is proposed almost anytime is the “Internet of Things” (IoT). This apparent panacea of the ICT world takes different aspects on and, actually, is identified with different (often very different) technological solutions. As a result, many think that IoT is just RFIDs, others think that it is sensor networks, and yet others that it is machine-to-machine communications. In the meanwhile, industrial players are taking advantage of the popularity of IoT to use it as a very trendy brand for technology solutions oriented to the consumer market. The scientific literature sometimes does not help much in clarifying, as it is rich in definitions of IoT often discordant between them. Objective of this paper is to present the evolutionary stages, i.e., generations, that have characterized the development of IoT, along with the motivations of their triggering. Besides, it analyzes the role that IoT can play in addressing the main societal challenges and the set of features expected from the relevant solutions. The final objective is to give a modern definition of the phenomenon, which de facto shows a strong pervasive nature, and, if not well understood in its theories, technologies, methodologies, and real potentials, then runs the risk of being regarded with suspicion and, thus, rejected by users.",

Information retrieved from such an object, turns it into a potential smart object, certainly able to auto identify itself and, if security problems are suitably treated, most probably able to connect to the global Internet. This way, one can get an ubiquitous framework to access, monitor and control any of those smart objects over an Internet of connected things. RFID tags in medical context enable a rapid and precise identification of each smart entity, enabling a ubiquitous and quick access to Personal Health Records over an Internet of Things. The use of smart phones with Internet access, along with strong security concerns - such as authenticity, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, entity authentication and non-repudiation - turn this whole context into a decentralized and mobile healthcare system. Using the simple IoT architecture presented, combining smart objects, the security solution and mobile communications, one may remotely take care of patients’ well being, establishing an ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living for Mobile Health applications.

Discovery of temporal patterns and temporal trends from such temporal data requires new algorithms and methodologies as most of the existing algorithms do not reveal emerging, seasonal and diminishing patterns.

We name our approach as G-SPAMINE. Experiment results show that G-SPAMINE out performs naive and sequential approaches and comparatively better to or atleast same as SPAMINE. In addition, the stamped temporal data adds extra level of privacy for temporal patterns in the IoT.",

However, such a vision encompasses the availability of thousands of smart devices, or even more, that continuously exchange a huge volume of data among each other and with cloud-based services, raising a big data problem. Such a problem can be approach by properly applying data fusion within an IoT infrastructure. Due to the characteristics and peculiarities of the communications among smart devices within an IoT, it is needed to adopt an event-based data fusion, where devices exchange notifications of events among each others, data fusion is focused in special devices where notification heterogeneity, and data source trust should be taken care. The contribution of this work is in this direction by proposing (i) a novel broker-less event-based communication protocol tailored to sensors with constrained resources, (ii) a solution to flexible event-based communications among heterogeneous data sources, and (iii) an approach based on the theory of evidence in the case of a data fusion process that depends on the matching and trust degree of the data to be fused.",

Despite the recent advances that have made IoT a reality, there are several challenges to be addressed towards exploiting its full potential and promoting tangible benefits to society, environment, economy, and individual citizens. Recently, Cloud Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to tackle some of the existing challenges in IoT while leveraging its adoption and bringing new opportunities. With the combination of IoT and Cloud Computing, the cloud becomes an intermediate layer between smart objects and applications that make use of data and resources provided by these objects. On the one hand, IoT can benefit from the almost unlimited resources of Cloud Computing to implement management and composition of services related to smart objects and their provided data. On the other hand, the cloud can benefit from IoT by broadening its operation scope to deal with real-world objects. In spite of this synergy, the literature still lacks of a broad, comprehensive overview on what has been investigated on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing and what are the open issues to be addressed in future research and development. The goal of this work is to fill this gap by systematically collecting and analyzing studies available in the literature aiming to: (i) obtain a comprehensive understanding on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing paradigms; (ii) provide an overview of the current state of research on this topic; and (iii) identify important gaps in the existing approaches as well as promising research directions. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was performed covering papers recently published in journals, conferences, and workshops, available at five relevant electronic databases. As a result, 35 studies were selected presenting strategies and solutions on how to integrate IoT and Cloud Computing as well as scenarios, research challenges, and opportunities in this context. Besides confirming the increasing interest on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing, this paper reports the main outcomes of the performed systematic mapping by both presenting an overview of the state of the art on the investigated topic and shedding light on important challenges and potential directions to future research.",

abstract = "Current advancements and growth in the arena of the Internet of Things (IoT) is providing great potential in the novel epoch of healthcare. The future of healthcare is expansively promising, as it advances the excellence of life and health of humans, involving several health regulations. Continual increases of multifaceted IoT devices in healthcare is beset by challenges, such as powering IoT terminal nodes used for health monitoring, data processing, smart decisions, and event management. In this paper, we propose a healthcare architecture which is based on an analysis of energy harvesting for health monitoring sensors and the realization of Big Data analytics in healthcare. The rationale of the proposed architecture is two-fold: (1) comprehensive conceptual framework for energy harvesting for health monitoring sensors; and (2) data processing and decision management for healthcare. The proposed architecture is a three-layered architecture that comprises: (1) energy harvesting and data generation; (2) data pre-processing; and (3) data processing and application. The proposed scheme highlights the effectiveness of energy-harvesting based IoT in healthcare. In addition, it also proposes a solution for smart health monitoring and planning. We also utilized consistent datasets on the Hadoop server to validate the proposed architecture based on threshold limit values (TLVs). The study demonstrates that the proposed architecture offers substantial and immediate value to the field of smart health.",

To date there is little work on trust computation in IoT environments for service management, especially for dealing with misbehaving owners of IoT devices that provide services to other IoT devices in the system. Our approach is to classify existing trust computation models for service management in IoT systems based on five essential design dimensions for a trust computation model: trust composition, trust propagation, trust aggregation, trust update, and trust formation. We summarize pros and cons of each dimension's options, and highlight the effectiveness of defense mechanisms against malicious attacks. We also summarize the most, least, and little visited trust computation techniques in the literature and provide insight on the effectiveness of trust computation techniques as applying to IoT systems. Finally, we identify gaps in IoT trust computation research and suggest future research directions.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) is about making “things” smart in some functionality, and connecting and enabling them to perform complex tasks by themselves. The functionality can be encapsulated as services and the task executed by composing the services. Two noteworthy functionalities of IoT services are monitoring and actuation. Monitoring implies continuous executions, and actuation is by triggering. Continuous executions typically involve stream processing. Stream input data are accumulated into batches and each batch is subjected to a sequence of computations, structured as a dataflow graph. The composition may be processing several batches simultaneously. Additionally, some non-stream OLTP transactions may also be executing concurrently. Thus, several composite transactions may be executing concurrently. This is in contrast to a typical Web services composition, where just one composite transaction is executed on each invocation. Therefore, defining transactional properties for executions of IoT service compositions is much more complex than for those of conventional Web service compositions. In this paper, we propose a transaction model and a correctness criterion for executions of IoT service compositions. Our proposal defines relaxed atomicity and isolation properties for transactions in a flexible manner and can be adapted for a variety of IoT applications.",

DQ problems manifestations are discussed and their symptoms identified. Data outliers, as a major DQ problem manifestation, their underlying knowledge and their impact in the context of IoT and its applications are studied. Techniques for enhancing DQ are presented with a special focus on data cleaning techniques which are reviewed and compared using an extended taxonomy to outline their characteristics and their fitness for use for IoT.

Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art PPDA techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of PPDA techniques.",

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.",

abstract = "With recent advancements in information technology more and more devices are integrated in the Internet of Things. These devices gather significant amount of private information pertinent to a user and while, in some cases it helps in improving the life style of an individual, in others it raises major privacy concerns. This trade-off between utility and privacy is highly dependent upon the devices in consideration and as the utility of the generated data increases, the privacy of an individual decreases. In this paper, we formulate a utility-privacy trade-off that enables a user to make appliance specific decisions as to how much data can be shared. This is achieved by parametrizing the degree of privacy allowed for each device and enabling the user to configure the parameter of each device. We use the smart metering application as the test case scenario for the proposed approach. We evaluate its performance using simulations conducted on the ECO data set. Our results indicate that, the proposed approach is successful in identifying appliances with an accuracy of 81.8% and a precision of 70.1%. In addition, it is demonstrated that device specific changes of the configuration parameters allow the degree of privacy achieved for the particular device and the utility to be well controlled, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, it is shown that, as expected, devices with higher power consumption contribute more to the overall privacy and utility achieved. A comparative study is also conducted and the proposed approach is shown to outperform the existing ElecPrivacy approach by producing a trace that is harder to identify, as reported after testing the Weiss’ and Baranski’s algorithm, both of which are well known Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring algorithms. Finally, it is demonstrated that the addition of noise, which is an integral part of the propose approach, can greatly improve performance.",

In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model.",

It becomes more challenging for the emerging users because of scarcity of bandwidth. To overcome the unforbidden challenges in the advanced technologies like smart cities, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio provides the solution to achieve high throughput and continuous connectivity for reliable communication. A primary challenge in the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is the identification of dependable Data Channels (DCHs) for Secondary Users (SUs) communication amongst the available channels, and the continuation of communication when the Primary Users (PUs) return. The objective of every SU is to intelligently choose reliable DCHs, thereby ensuring reliable connectivity and successful transfer of data frames across the cognitive networks. The proposed Reliable, Intelligent and Smart Cognitive Radio protocol consumes less computational time and transmits energy with high throughput, as compared to the benchmark Cognitive Radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocols. This paper provides new applications of CR technology for IoT and proposes new and effective solutions to the real challenges in CR technology that will make IoT more affordable and applicable.",

The insight of the smart urban is extensively preferred, as it improves the excellence of life of citizens, connecting several regulations, that is, smart transportation, smart parking, smart environment, smart healthcare, and so forth. Continuous intensification of the multifaceted urban set-up is extensively challenged by real-time processing of data and smart decision capabilities. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a smart city architecture which is based on Big Data analytics. The proposed scheme is comprised of three modules: (1) data acquisition and aggregation module collects varied and diverse data interrelated to city services, (2) data computation and processing module performs normalization, filtration, processing and data analysis, and (3) application and decision module formulates decisions and initiates events. The proposed architecture is a generic solution for the smart urban planning and variety of datasets is analyzed to validate this architecture. In addition, we tested reliable datasets on Hadoop server to verify the threshold limit value (TLV) and the investigation demonstrates that the proposed scheme offer valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture.

A systematic literature review identified four key privacy themes that represent issues related to the collection of individuals' data through the IoT: unauthorised surveillance, uncontrolled data generation and use, inadequate authentication and information security risks. These four themes are used to critically analyse the Australian Privacy Principle's (APPs) protection of individual data. Findings indicate that (1) the APPs do not adequately protect individual privacy of data collected through the IoT, and (2) future privacy legislation must consider the implications of global reach of IoT services, and ubiquity and security of IoT data collection with respect to individual privacy.",

Our proposed security scheme is therefore based on RSA, the most widely used public key cryptography algorithm.

Our implementation of DTLS is presented in the context of a system architecture and the scheme’s feasibility (low overheads and high interoperability) is further demonstrated through extensive evaluation on a hardware platform suitable for the Internet of Things.",

Our system utilizes Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS) with new method of error correction codes and secret sharing schemes. We introduce the concept of an approximate value of a rank of a number (AR), which allows us to reduce the computational complexity of the decoding from RNS to binary representation, and size of the coefficients. Based on the properties of the approximate value and arithmetic properties of RNS, we introduce AR-RRNS method for error detection, correction, and controlling computational results. We provide a theoretical basis to configure probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of encoding and decoding to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and storage properties. Theoretical analysis shows that by appropriate selection of RRNS parameters, the proposed scheme allows not only increasing safety, reliability, and reducing an overhead of data storage, but also processing of encrypted data.",

This is compounded in the so-called Smart Cities, where the objective of the IoT is to exploit information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support added-value services for citizens, giving companies more opportunities to innovate through the use of the latest technologies. In this context, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are building alliances, starting several projects with public and private city stakeholders aimed at exploring new technologies for cities but also at exploiting new IoT-based devices and services in order to profit from them. This implies that companies need to manage and integrate different types of knowledge to efficiently and effectively support the simultaneous pressure of exploration and exploitation, at a project portfolio level. Using structural equations modeling with data collected from 43 IoT smart city project alliances in Italy, this paper tests and finds evidence that MNEs need to develop knowledge management (KM) capabilities combined with ICT capabilities if they want to obtain greater ambidexterity performance at the project portfolio level. More specifically, we highlight that KM capabilities enhance alliance ambidexterity indirectly through firms' ICT capabilities, suggesting that MNE managers should design KM tools and develop new ICT skills.

In this paper, we show that the two native algorithms that handle changes in network topology – the Trickle and Neighbor Discovery algorithms – behave in a reactive fashion and thus are not prepared for the dynamics inherent to nodes mobility. Many emerging and upcoming IoT application scenarios are expected to impose real-time and reliable mobile data collection, which are not compatible with the long message latency, high packet loss and high overhead exhibited by the native RPL/6loWPAN protocols. To solve this problem, we integrate a proactive hand-off mechanism (dubbed smart-HOP) within RPL, which is very simple, effective and backward compatible with the standard protocol. We show that this add-on halves the packet loss and reduces the hand-off delay dramatically to one tenth of a second, upon nodes’ mobility, with a sub-percent overhead. The smart-HOP algorithm has been implemented and integrated in the Contiki 6LoWPAN/RPL stack (source-code available on-line mrpl: smart-hop within rpl, 2014) and validated through extensive simulation and experimentation.",

Although users can enjoy a lot of flexibility and conveniences from the LBS with IoT, they may also lose their privacy. Untrusted or malicious LBS servers with all users’ information can track users in various ways or release personal data to third parties. In this work, we first analyze the current dummy-location selection (DLS) algorithm—an efficient location privacy preservation approach and design an attack algorithm for DLS (ADLS) for test emerging IoT security. For efficiently preserving user's location privacy, we propose a novel dummy location privacy-preserving (DLP) algorithm by considering both computational costs and various privacy requirements of different users. Extensive simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. Evaluation results show that the ADLS algorithm has a high probability of identifying the user's real location out from chosen dummy locations in the DLS algorithm. Our proposed DLP algorithm has clear advantages over the DLS algorithm in term of lower probability of revealing the user's real location and improved computational cost and efficiency (i.e., time, speed, accuracy, and complexity) while preserve the same privacy level as DLS algorithm.",

A typical IoT network comprises thousands of IoT devices using heterogeneous protocols, having varying resources, complex interdependencies and diverse networking and security requirements. The configuration data of IoT systems is mostly unstructured, lacking machine interpretable semantics and thus, traditional analysis techniques cannot tackle the IoT-specific configuration challenges of scalability, interoperability and security.

The approach leverages a combination of newly constructed as well as extended and aligned versions of existing ontologies. Configuration analytics are performed automatically by describing the context of complex IoT interactions and dependencies through rules-supported reasoning and queries. The evaluation involves ontology-based security classification of 954 real-world IoT products and security analysis of their practically-deployed system configurations. Our automated approach has proven to be scalable, easily manageable, formally verifiable and free from errors induced by tedious manual configurations.",

The process of acquiring, analysing and managing data obtained by sensors and actuators in industrial environments can benefit from modern Cloud-based platforms towards a complete implementation of the Industrie 4.0 concept. The analysis of huge data sets produced by these sensors (Big Data) could allow quick and accurate decision making. For example, productivity improvements can be achieved by analysing device performance and degradation for real-time feedback on configuration and optimization. This work proposes a Cloud-based architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) applications to improve the deployment of smart industrial systems based on remote monitoring and control. By using specific technologies available as a service, we demonstrate the proposed architecture on an automated electric induction motor use case. This approach includes layers for sensor network data gathering, data transformation between standard protocols, message queuing, real-time data analysis, reporting for further analysis, and real-time control. Particularly, by using the proposed architecture, we remotely monitored, controlled and processed data produced by sensors and actuators coupled to the motor. Preliminary results indicate this foundation can support predictive methods and management of automated systems in the Industrie 4.0 context.",

While the number of IoT service users has increased dramatically, little is understood about what motivates the continued use of such services. The primary objective of this study is to develop and refine a conceptual framework from the perspective of network externalities and privacy to provide a theoretical understanding of the motivations that drive continued use of IoT services. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 508 users concerning their perceptions of IoT services. The results indicate network externalities play a significant role in influencing consumers' perception of usage benefits and thus adoption, whereas privacy concerns have a relatively weak effect on adoption. Implications for IS researchers and practice are discussed.",

abstract = "Application development in the Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging because it involves dealing with a wide range of related issues such as lack of separation of concerns, and lack of high-level of abstractions to address both the large scale and heterogeneity. Moreover, stakeholders involved in the application development have to address issues that can be attributed to different life-cycles phases. when developing applications. First, the application logic has to be analyzed and then separated into a set of distributed tasks for an underlying network. Then, the tasks have to be implemented for the specific hardware. Apart from handling these issues, they have to deal with other aspects of life-cycle such as changes in application requirements and deployed devices. Several approaches have been proposed in the closely related fields of wireless sensor network, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, and software engineering in general to address the above challenges. However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the IoT. This paper proposes an integrated approach for addressing the above mentioned challenges. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a development methodology that separates IoT application development into different concerns and provides a conceptual framework to develop an application, (2) a development framework that implements the development methodology to support actions of stakeholders. The development framework provides a set of modeling languages to specify each development concern and abstracts the scale and heterogeneity related complexity. It integrates code generation, task-mapping, and linking techniques to provide automation. Code generation supports the application development phase by producing a programming framework that allows stakeholders to focus on the application logic, while our mapping and linking techniques together support the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a distributed system collaboratively hosted by individual devices. Our evaluation based on two realistic scenarios shows that the use of our approach improves the productivity of stakeholders involved in the application development.",

Such services could help mobile tourists, i.e. tourist who is currently moving between various sites, to get innovative set of services which make their trip easier and safer. Designing efficient solutions that help tourists with chronic diseases to find an appropriate geographical route from a source to a tourism destination through a transportation network is crucial to healthcare systems. This paper proposes a new approach in generating geographical routes that are best served with close medical centers. Our approach, called Geographical Routing for Mobile Tourist (GRMT), selects a route that is best served with medical centers, and goes through the path that is as shortest as possible in regards with the distance. We have modeled and simulated the proposed approach using simulation program. Simulated experimental results show that GRMT allows tourists to select geographical routes that are served with the highest number of close medical centers although the selected route is slightly longer in distance.",

Therefore, social networks using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been constructed. As ICT continues to be used in various modern applications, security vulnerabilities from legacy ICT have been inherited by social IoT network systems. To guarantee the safety of these applications, these networks must be protected from various cyberattacks. A variety of security technologies and products have been developed for this purpose. However, the most important task in dealing with cyberattacks is to inspect the current security status of a social IoT network system. Many types of vulnerability quantification methods exist for inspecting the security vulnerabilities of network systems. However, with legacy methods, quantification results lack objectivity. In this study, to compensate for this limitation, we propose a game-theory-based vulnerability quantification method using attack tree, which consists of three steps: game strategy modeling, cost-impact analyzation, and payoff calculation. We present a case study for a social-IoT-based network environment. Using the proposed method, we believe social IoT network system security experts will be able to cope with security incidents more effectively. The proposed method can be used as a reference for constructing a safer social IoT network system.",

This work presents the design, implementation and test of an adaptive algorithm, making the timing of the clocks converge as quickly as possible and after this convergence, keeping them most similar as possible. The goal is to achieve the best method that ensures right timing and still having low energy consumption. Experimental results provide evidence of the success in meeting this goal.",

Considering the information required for supporting three sequential and distinct rhythms in emergency response operations: mobilization rhythm, preliminary situation assessment rhythm, and intervention rhythm, the paper proposes a modified task-technology fit approach that is used to investigate how the IoT technology can be incorporated into the three rhythms and enhance emergency response operations.

Our proposed system is an interactive AR application that runs on different interfaces, allowing the user to digitally interact with the physical items on the shelf, thanks to an updated inventory provided by an RFID system. The resulting experience is close to being able to browse a shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the items it contains, allowing wheelchair users to shop independently, and providing autonomy in their everyday activities. Fourteen wheelchair users with different degrees of impairment have participated in the study and development of the system.

In this context, we present a system that enables PHDs to share information in home networks and with the Internet based on a new Internet of Things protocol, namely the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is used along with the IEEE 11073 family of standards, which is the main exchange data model for PHD communication. We discuss how the proposed system can be integrated to other connected health systems, such as a Universal Plug and Play healthcare system. We detail how the CoAP communication model was adapted to the IEEE 11073 model. We also present a real PHD prototype and its evaluation results. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution, showing how its network overhead is around 50% lighter when compared to other protocols. Finally, we tested the proposed solution based on different scenarios, including a proof-of-concept integration with a service in the cloud, using different wireless physical interfaces.",

Since IoT are always related to user’s daily life or work, the privacy and security are of great importance. The pervasive, complex and heterogeneous properties of IoT make its security issues very challenging. In addition, the large number of resources-constraint nodes makes a rigid lightweight requirement for IoT security mechanisms. Presently, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a popular solution to achieve secure data transmission, storage and sharing in the distributed environment such as IoT. However, the existing ABE schemes are based on expensive bilinear pairing, which make them not suitable for the resources-constraint IoT applications. In this paper, a lightweight no-pairing ABE scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed to address the security and privacy issues in IoT. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the ECDDH assumption instead of bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption, and is proved in the attribute based selective-set model. By uniformly determining the criteria and defining the metrics for measuring the communication overhead and computational overhead, the comparison analyses with the existing ABE schemes are made in detail. The results show that the proposed scheme has improved execution efficiency and low communication costs. In addition, the limitations and the improving directions of it are also discussed in detail.",

As the number of wireless devices is rising, new medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols have been developed to guarantee end-to-end network performance. When existing layered solutions are stacked together, there might be detrimental effects on the overall network performance. In this paper, an analysis of MAC and routing protocols for IoT is provided with focus on the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the IETF RPL standards. It is shown that existing routing metrics do not account for the complex interactions between MAC and routing, and thus novel metrics are proposed. This enables a protocol selection mechanism for selecting the routing option and adapting the MAC parameters, given specific performance constraints. Extensive analytical and experimental results show that the behavior of the MAC protocol can hurt the performance of the routing protocol and vice versa, unless these two are carefully optimized together by the proposed method.",

abstract = "Internet of Things will serve communities across the different domains of life. Tracking mobile targets is one important system engineering application in IOT, and the resource of embedded devices and objects working under IoT implementation are constrained. Thus, building a scheme to make full use of energy is key issue for mobile target tracking applications. To achieve both energy efficiency and high monitoring performance, an effective Knowledge-aware Proactive Nodes Selection (KPNS) system is proposed in this paper. The innovations of KPNS are as follows: 1) the number of proactive nodes are dynamically adjusted based on prediction accuracy of target trajectory. If the prediction accuracy is high, the number of proactive nodes in the non-main predicted area will be decreased. If prediction accuracy of moving trajectory is low, large number of proactive nodes will be selected to enhance monitoring quality. 2) KPNS takes full advantage of energy to further enhance target tracking performance by properly selecting more proactive nodes in the network. We evaluated the efficiency of KPNS with both theory analysis and simulation based experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with Probability-based target Prediction and Sleep Scheduling strategy (PPSS), KPNS scheme improves the energy efficiency by 60%, and can reduce target missing rate and tracking delay to 66%, 75% respectively.",

However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model for smart objects description and users request resolution using ontological techniques combined with description logics.

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long “lookahead” planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully or partially automate various communication functions across the construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then provides first insights – through various construction scenarios – into how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management to the management of the entire building lifecycle.",

The fundamental part of the module is a mathematical framework, which is developed to obtain the optimal routing paths and the communication parameters among things, by exploiting the interrelations among different layer functionalities in the IoT. Moreover, a cross-layer communication protocol is presented to implement this optimization framework in practical scenarios. The results show that the proposed solution can achieve a global communication optimum and outperforms existing layered solutions.

abstract = "The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where a selection of appropriate features and High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently select features and analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.",

abstract = "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is seen as one of the requirements for the implementation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). However, an RFID system has to be equipped with a holistic security framework for a secure and scalable operation. Although much work has been done to provide privacy and anonymity, little focus has been given to performance, scalability and customizability issues to support robust implementation of IoT. Also, existing protocols suffer from a number of deficiencies such as insecure or inefficient identification techniques, throughput delay and inadaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel identification technique based on a hybrid approach (group-based approach and collaborative approach) and security check handoff (SCH) for RFID systems with mobility. The proposed protocol provides customizability and adaptability as well as ensuring the secure and scalable deployment of an RFID system to support a robust distributed structure such as the IoT. The protocol has an extra fold of protection against malware using an incorporated malware detection technique. We evaluated the protocol using a randomness battery test and the results show that the protocol offers better security, scalability and customizability than the existing protocols.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging and promising paradigm that can be considered as an extension of the Internet to interconnect all kinds of smart objects around us to provide a pervasive (or ubiquitous) information access. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), as a vital component of the IoT, allow the representation of the dynamic characteristics of the real world in the Internet's virtual world. Thus, sensor nodes are henceforth considered as Internet hosts and, may act as web servers or clients. The maturity of the Internet of Things is arguably linked to communications security and end-users privacy protection. However, the material and technological heterogeneity as well as the asymmetric nature of the communications between the sensor nodes and the classical Internet hosts are making security a challenging problem. In this context, many recent works focus on leveraging IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints commonly by messages compression or by computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression for the header of HIP (Host Identity Protocol) packets, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of security computational load in HIP Base EXchange (HIP-BEX). To achieve extremely lightweight end-to-end (E2E) security, we combine both proposed compression and distribution models for HIP in WSN's side, in the IoT. The evaluation results show clearly that the proposed solution, named Compressed and Distributed HIP (CD-HIP), is sufficiently energy efficient with a slight security establishment delay, and a good level of compatibility with the standard HIP.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in which resource-constrained objects connect to unreliable Internet by using a wide range of technologies. The insecure nature of the Internet and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of IoT, make IoT vulnerable to different attacks, especially routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion detection framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in IoT called sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based intrusion detection agents, that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local results to the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection agent, that is located in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for projecting clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the MapReduce architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering models and consequently parallel detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes decision about suspicious behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole attack. The deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features of the proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in this study. The experimental results of simulated scenarios showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate of 76.19% and false positive rate of 5.92% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks were launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02% and 2.08%, respectively.",

As wireless internet has spread widely over the world, it can be readily used to communicate information related to, for example, human health. Indeed, some institutes have demonstrated the measurement of physical vital signals (e.g., temperature, pulse, and heartbeat) of the body for monitoring through a smartphone. However, biochemical analytes such as proteins and bacteria are currently difficult to measure based on antigen-antibody binding due to several technological barriers. Among them, the terminal unit of detection for, for instance, pathogens is mostly bulky, insensitive, or even expensive for sophisticated devices. We have studied the use of CMOS image sensor (CIS) for detecting the signal produced from an immuno-analytical system, which could resolve the detection issue hindering monitoring via IoT. In this study, an immunosensor system using CIS for detection means was fabricated to pocket-sized dimensions and then employed for determining a food-borne pathogen, the Vibrio species, in real samples. The analysis was controlled and monitored using a smartphone that was also used to upload the result as data to the internet server for sharing with the public. To our knowledge, this study could be the first exemplification of pathogen monitoring via IoT in the field of healthcare.",

Therefore, the sink node which based on embedded multi-core SoC for IoTs and maximizing its computing performance has brought into focus in recent years. In this paper, we design a multi-core Task-Efficient Sink Node (TESN) based on heterogeneous architecture and the Weighted-Least Connection (WLC) task schedule strategy has been proposed to improve its efficiency. There are two types of cores in the sink node, master core and slave cores. The master core deals with tasks allocation and the seven slave cores deal with data processing. All of the cores are communicating with each other through mailbox. By considering each core’s real-time processing information and computing performance, the proposed WLC can balance each core’s load and reduce network congestion. The XilinxV5 platform is used to evaluate the performance of WLC and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms for multi-core sink node. The experiment results show that the WLC strategy improves the processing speed obviously, achieves load balance and avoids large scale congestion of sink node in the sensor networks of IoTs.",

The network load of the unstructured information flow is the most important aspect that impacts the service quality of the network as well as the life expectancy of a node; as a result, the methods of network performance optimization and increase in life expectancy in the networks with a high information transmission rate become ineffective. Nowadays the amount of transmitted information in the Internet of Things networks is increased and becomes chaotic which results in the reduction of the overall network efficiency and life expectancy.

abstract = "Flexibility of a manufacturing system is quite important and advantageous in modern industry, which function in a competitive environment where market diversity and the need for customized product are growing. Key machinery in a manufacturing system should be reliable, flexible, intelligent, less complex, and cost effective. To achieve these goals, the design methodologies for engineering systems should be revisited and improved. In particular, continuous or on-demand design improvements have to be incorporated rapidly and effectively in order to address new design requirements or resolve potential weaknesses of the original design. Design of an engineering system, which is typically a multi-domain system, can become complicated due to its complex structure and possible dynamic coupling between domains. An integrated and concurrent approach should be considered in the design process, in particular in the conceptual and detailed design phases. In the context of multi-domain design, attention has been given recently to such subjects as multi-criteria decision making, multi-domain modeling, evolutionary computing, and genetic programing. More recently, machine condition monitoring has been considered for integration into a scheme of design evolution even though many challenges exist for this to become a reality such as lack of systematic approaches and the existence of technical barriers in massive condition data acquisition, transmission, storage and mining. Recently, the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing (CC) are being developed quickly and they offer new opportunities for evolutionary design for such tasks as data acquisition, storage and processing. In this paper, a framework for the closed-loop design evolution of engineering systems is proposed in order to achieve continuous design improvement for an engineering system through the use of a machine condition monitoring system assisted by IoT and CC. New design requirements or the detection of design weaknesses of an existing engineering system can be addressed through the proposed framework. A design knowledge base that is constructed by integrating design expertise from domain experts, on-line process information from condition monitoring and other design information from various sources is proposed to realize and supervise the design process so as to achieve increased efficiency, design speed, and effectiveness. The framework developed in this paper is illustrated by using a case study of design evolution of an industrial manufacturing system.",

IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between “everything”, IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytics tools are able to extract “sense” from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.",

abstract = "Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) is a novel class of mobile Internet of Things (IoT) applications for community sensing where sensors and mobile devices jointly collect and share data of interest to observe phenomena over a large geographic area. The inherent device mobility and high sensing frequency has the capacity to produce dense and rich spatiotemporal information about our environment, but also creates new challenges due to device dynamicity and energy constraints, as well as large volumes of generated raw sensor data which need to be processed and analyzed to extract useful information for end users. The paper presents an ecosystem for mobile crowd sensing which relies on the CloUd-based PUblish/Subscribe middleware (CUPUS) to acquire sensor data from mobile devices in a flexible and energy-efficient manner and to perform near real-time processing of Big Data streams. CUPUS has unique features compared to other MCS platforms: It enables management of mobile sensor resources within the cloud, supports filtering and aggregation of sensor data on mobile devices prior to its transmission into the cloud based on global data requirements, and can push information of interest from the cloud to user devices in near real-time. We present our experience with implementation and deployment of an MCS application for air quality monitoring built on top of the CUPUS middleware. Our experimental evaluation shows that CUPUS offers scalable processing performance, both on mobile devices and within the cloud, while its data propagation delay is mainly affected by transmission delay on wireless links.",

Ethnographic research methodologies were employed in both studies to interpret the impact on retail consumers who actively engaged with objects that contain qualitative information. The RememberMe exhibition connected personal audio recordings to items that had been donated to Oxfam in Manchester, UK. Memories associated with donated objects were recorded by previous owners and attached to the items prior to reselling, either by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags or Quick Read (QR) code labels. The RememberUS exhibition emphasised the importance of the information rather than the object, utilising dummy objects as a vessel for holding memories. Customers were observed spending more time interacting with tagged items and searching for further tagged items in the store, allowing a greater understanding of the journey the objects had taken. From the retailer viewpoint: customers were more likely to buy tagged objects, increasing sales revenue. The study was designed to encourage future stories to be added to the items using the same tags.",

The SHM should observe the context and provide reliable information about the integrity of the structure. There is a need for an embedded system with dynamic reconfiguration mechanism which can adapt itself to the unstable and ever changing environments of structural and traffic monitoring. The implementation of dynamic reconfiguration is still challenging for real time embedded system control software.

This phenomena is changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens? These are the questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones, public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering participations and interactions based on our own experience from deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are presented in this paper.",

We found out that AdaBoost M1 classifier had the best overall recognition accuracy (86.78%).

Thus, there has been an increase in the request for embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays, base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework, and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban planning or city future development, the offline historical data are analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of throughput and processing time.",

Therefore, operational decision that is based on late and incomplete information becomes untimely and not optimal. This paper presents an approach for real-time waste monitoring, analysis and discovers waste reduction potential in manufacturing shop floor. The objective of this study is to learn the waste performance in manufacturing shop floor. Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) is conducted to perform waste benchmarking analysis and the outcome is presented as relative efficiency. The efficiency values are then classified using quartile into 3 performance classes: normal, warning and abnormal. With the performance status, it leads manager to discover achievable waste reduction targets and hence empowers optimization of operational efficiency. A case study using microfluidic device manufacturing line is studied to demonstrate real-time waste monitoring and benchmarking.",

We focus on opportunities and challenges stemming from consumption data that comes from ICO, and on how this data can be mapped onto strategic choices of product variety. We develop a simple analytical framework that illustrates the underlying mechanisms of a product supplier/producer׳s choice between (i) producing multiple product varieties as a way of meeting consumer demand (a “tailoring strategy”), and (ii) offering a flexible and standardised platform which enables consumers׳ needs to be met by incorporating personal ICO data into various customisable applications (a “platform strategy”). Under a platform strategy, the ICO data is independently produced by other providers and can be called on in both use and context of use. We derive conditions under which each of the strategies may be profitable for the provider through maximising consumers’ value. Our findings are that the higher the demand for contextual variety, the more profitable the platform strategy becomes, relative to the tailoring strategy. Our study concludes by considering the implications for SCM research and practice with an extension to postponement taxonomies, including those where the customer, and not the supplier, is the completer of the product, and we show that this yields higher profits than the tailoring strategy.",

The purpose of the Internet of Things (IoT), is to make permanent and inclusive the access and interaction with a great variety of devices connected to Internet: the network of networks. The Internet of Things has a lot of applications as for example those for household, vigilance, sensor monitoring, actuators, intelligent displays, vehicles, among others. This in turn allows for the potential development of a large number of applications consuming information coming from these connected objects, which in turn are capable to provide new services to the citizens, enterprises and the public administration. The purpose of this research work is the development of an architecture based on the internet of things (IoT) that allows the use of sensors with the capacity to collect information related to environmental variables and additionally permitting the easy integration with any other types of sensors associated with measurements for a smart city environment, with the aim of providing data on which the conditions of the different environments of a smart city can be determined. Using this information as a tool we intend to improve the process in decision making, starting with the improvements in city design to the increase and improvement of commodities for the city inhabitants.",

However, the performance of such a system is restricted by several factors, namely, various user requirements, various types of appliances, enormous need of communications, limited network bandwidth, and limited computation power. Considering these restrictions, IoT resource allocation problem (IRAP) is one of the most critical problems because a good solution to this problem will be very useful for enhancing the performance of such a system. That is why an effective algorithm will be presented in this paper for solving the IoT resource allocation problem of the internet of things. The concepts of data clustering and metaheuristic are employed for the proposed algorithm to allocate the large-scale devices and gateways of IoT to reduce the total communication cost between them. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the other resource allocation algorithms compared in this paper in terms of the total data communication costs.",

Although various definitions of intelligent products have been proposed, we introduce a new definition of the notion of Intelligent Product inspired by what happens in nature with us as human beings and the way we develop intelligence and knowledge. We see an intelligent product as a product system which contains sensing, memory, data processing, reasoning and communication capabilities at four intelligence levels. This future generations of Intelligent Products will need new Product Data Technologies allowing the seamless interoperability of systems and exchange of not only Static but of Dynamic Product Data as well. Actual standards for PDT cover only lowest intelligence of today’s products. In this context, we try to shape the actual state and a possible future of the Product Data Technologies from a Closed-Loop Product Lifecycle Management (C-L PLM) perspective. Our approach is founded in recent findings of the FP6 IP 507100 project PROMISE and follow-up research work. Standards of the STEP family, covering the product lifecycle to a certain extend (PLCS) as well as MIMOSA and ISO 15926 are discussed together with more recent technologies for the management of ID and sensor data such as EPCglobal, OGC-SWE and relevant PROMISE propositions for standards. Finally, the first efforts towards ontology based semantic standards for product lifecycle management and associated knowledge management and sharing are presented and discussed.",

Trust management plays an important role in such SCIoT scenarios where smart objects have to establish social relationships. Also, these smart objects select other objects in their vicinity as friend or foe based on their trust upon those objects to establish an effective successful collaboration.

abstract = "The recently coined Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm leverages a large volume of heterogeneous Network Elements (NEs) demanding broad connectivity anywhere, anytime and anyhow, fueling the deployment of innovative Internet services, such as Cloud or Fog Computing, Data Center Networks (DCNs), Smart Cities or Smart Transportation. The proper deployment of these novel Internet services is imposing hard connectivity constraints, such as high transmission capacity, reliable communications, as well as an efficient control scheme capable of enabling an agile coordination of actions in large heterogeneous scenarios. In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information analyzing PCE benefits in these IoT scenarios. In this paper, we distill how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in IoT scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel PCE strategy referred to as Service-Oriented PCE (SPCE), which enables network-aware service composition.",

In this paper, we present a comparison of two approaches based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for implementing a Real-Time Monitoring System of Meal Distribution Trolleys in a hospital. The performance evaluation results show that the IoT implementation yields much lower latencies than the WSN implementation, and the latency does not depend on the location of the trolley or the building size. Also, the IoT approach yields slightly better battery life expectancy than the WSN approach. Thus, the IoT approach seems the best option for real-time surveillance systems installed in meal distribution trolleys.",

Moreover, the pervasive nature of IoT data presents a number of privacy threats because of intermediate data processing steps, including data acquisition, data aggregation, fusion and integration. User profiling and record linkage are well studied topics in online social networks (OSNs); however, these have become more critical in IoT applications where different systems share and integrate data and information.

To provide guidance on future efforts in this emerging research area, this paper presents a unified framework for personal comfort models. We first define the problem by providing a brief discussion of existing thermal comfort models and their limitations for real-world applications, and then review the current state of research on personal comfort models including a summary of key advances and gaps. We then describe a modeling framework to establish fundamental concepts and methodologies for developing and evaluating personal comfort models, followed by a discussion of how such models can be integrated into indoor environmental controls. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for applications of personal comfort models for building design, control, standards, and future research.",

These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

Data produced by such sensors can be used for several purposes and by different actors, such as doctors, patients, relatives, and health care centers, in order to provide remote assistance to users. However, major challenges arise mainly in terms of the interoperability among several heterogeneous devices from a variety of manufacturers. In this context, we introduce EcoHealth (Ecosystem of Health Care Devices), a Web middleware platform for connecting doctors and patients using attached body sensors, thus aiming to provide improved health monitoring and diagnosis for patients. This platform is able to integrate information obtained from heterogeneous sensors in order to provide mechanisms to monitor, process, visualize, store, and send notifications regarding patients’ conditions and vital signs at real-time by using Internet standards.

This study empirically tests a novel research model drawing on coping theory and coping model of user adaptation. Data were collected from United States consumers using stratified and random sampling method. The effective sample included 260 responses from consumers. The results indicate that consumers' health and privacy concerns initiate a coping process. Problem-focused and emotion-focused coping efforts significantly predict the extended use of healthcare wearable devices. This study offers several implications for theory and research. Most notably, it demonstrates the viability of coping as a high-level theoretical lens for examining consumers’ post-adoptive use of information technology.",

This protocol is based on collaboration to establish a secure end-to-end communication channel between a highly resource constrained node and a remote entity. The secure channel allows the constrained node to transmit captured data while ensuring confidentiality and authentication. To achieve this goal, we propose offloading highly consuming cryptographic primitives to third parties. As a result, the constrained node obtains assistance from powerful entities. To assess our protocol, we conduct a formal validation regarding security properties. In addition, we evaluate both communication and computational costs to highlight energy savings. The results show that our protocol provides a considerable gain in energy while its security properties are ensured.",

abstract = "The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the most significant technologies in the 21st century and they are very suitable for distributed data collecting and monitoring in tough environments such as greenhouses. The other most significant technologies in the 21st century is the Internet of Things (IoT) which has rapidly developed covering hundreds of applications in the civil, health, military and agriculture areas. In modern greenhouses, several measurement points are required to trace down the local climate parameters in different parts of a large scale greenhouse in order to ensure proper operation of the greenhouse automation system. Cabling would make the measurement system expensive, vulnerable and also difficult to relocate once installed. This paper presents a WSN prototype consisting of MicaZ nodes which are used to measure greenhouses’ temperature, light, pressure and humidity. Measurement data have been shared with the help of IoT. With this system farmers can control their greenhouse from their mobile phones or computers which have internet connection.",

abstract = "Pulmonary cancer is considered as one of the major causes of death worldwide. For the detection of lung cancer, computer-assisted diagnosis (CADx) systems have been designed. Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled ubiquitous internet access to biomedical datasets and techniques; in result, the progress in CADx is significant. Unlike the conventional CADx, deep learning techniques have the basic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature as they have the ability to learn mid and high level image representations. We proposed a Computer-Assisted Decision Support System in Pulmonary Cancer by using the novel deep learning based model and metastasis information obtained from MBAN (Medical Body Area Network). The proposed model, DFCNet, is based on the deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) which is used for classification of each detected pulmonary nodule into four lung cancer stages. The performance of proposed work is evaluated on different datasets with varying scan conditions. Comparison of proposed classifier is done with the existing CNN techniques. Overall accuracy of CNN and DFCNet was 77.6% and 84.58%, respectively. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the detection and classification of lung cancer nodules. These results demonstrate the potential for the proposed technique in helping the radiologists in improving nodule detection accuracy with efficiency.",

They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately. The algorithms used for each mobile gateway service, and the scenarios where the mobile gateway acts as a communication channel or a smart object are also addressed on this paper.",

IoT(T, n) is a network of things composed of T things with n items (packets) distributed randomly on it. The aim of the permutation routing is to route to each thing, its items, so it can accomplish its task. In this paper, we propose two agent-based broadcast protocols for mobile IoT, using a limited number of communication channels. The main idea is to partition the things into groups where an agent in each group manages a group of things. This partitioning is based on the memory capacities for these heterogeneous nodes. The first protocol uses a few communication channels to perform a parallel broadcasting and requires O(nk) memory space, where k is the number of communication channels. The second protocol uses an optimal complexity of memory space for each thing to achieve the permutation routing with a parallel broadcasting using less number of channels. We give an estimation of the upper and lower bounds of the number of broadcast rounds in the worst case and we discuss experimental results.",

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient’s emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. Finally, we outline our prototype which runs on multiple computing platforms and show results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

The reconfiguration process brings a critical issue within the RMS that is called as reconfiguration planning (RP) problems in this paper. However, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) that has been a global issue, many companies or manufacturers are trying to integrate it into their smart systems. RMS as well needs to apply IoT in order to establish the internetworking between machines and the logic, so that RP problems can be solved, automated, and controlled.

Future Internet is expected to be driven by prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT). This prevalence of IoT promises to impact every aspect of human life in the foreseeable future where computing paradigm would witness huge influx of IoT data. Context is gaining growing attention to make sense of the data and it is envisaged that context-aware computing would act as an indispensable enabler for IoT. Contextualizing the collected IoT data enables to reap value from the data and to harvest the knowledge. Reasoning the contextualized data, that is, context information is imperative to the vision of harvesting knowledge. Edge computing is also expected to play a vital role in IoT to reduce dependency on cloud based solution, to achieve faster response, and to provide intelligence closer to the IoT things. The combination of context-awareness and edge solution would be inseparable in the future IoT. Furthermore, IoT vision comprises of different IoT applications controlled by a capable controller at the edge, an edge controller necessitates to counter the challenge of providing knowledge for each of the IoT applications. Therefore, such a controller requires to offer different context-aware reasoning to alleviate the intelligence-of-things. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-modal context-aware reasoner the aim of which is to provide knowledge at the edge for each IoT application. The context-aware reasoning has been verified with rules-based and Bayesian reasoning for three IoT applications and initial results suggest that it is promising to realize such multimodal reasoning at the edge with low latency.",

The conducted study considers well-known benchmark network topologies, real IoT monitoring services, and standardized settings for urban and rural environments.

Therefore, we reviewed non-technical papers to examine the current status of scholarly discourse and applied analytic hierarchy process models to assess the priorities for future IoT research. Although papers in science and engineering fields were excluded, analysis of 300 articles showed that a considerable number of papers were written by engineers, mainly concerning industrial content. Experts perceived that systematic methods and tangible subjects were the most necessary to motivate research in the social sciences sector. Multidisciplinary research was considered important regardless of the research disciplines, and user study was assigned a particularly large weight.

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) applications rely on networks composed of set of heterogeneous sensors and smart devices, which have the capability to constantly, observe the surroundings and gather data. This heterogeneity is reflected on raw data gathered by such type of systems. Consequently, the task of high-level IoT applications to interpret such data and detect events in the real world is more complex. Moreover, data heterogeneity leads to the lack of interoperability between IoT applications. Semantic Web (SW) technologies have been widely adopted to model and integrate data from different sources on the web; extending them to the IoT domain can be used to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Semantically annotating IoT data is a fundamental step toward developing smarter and interoperable IoT applications. However, this type of process requires a large amount of computing resources, especially in scenarios where a large number of sensors is expected to be involved such as smart city. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight semantic annotation approach that can be implemented on resource-constrained IoT gateways connected to a limited number of sensors. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have carried out a set of experimentations using a middleware prototype implementation. Several benchmarks are considered such as: Data size, response time, and resource utilization.",

Health monitoring systems based on Internet-of-things (IoT) have been recently introduced to improve the quality of health care services. However, the number of advanced IoT-based continuous glucose monitoring systems is small and the existing systems have several limitations. In this paper we study feasibility of invasive and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system utilizing IoT based approach. We designed an IoT-based system architecture from a sensor device to a back-end system for presenting real-time glucose, body temperature and contextual data (i.e. environmental temperature) in graphical and human-readable forms to end-users such as patients and doctors. In addition, nRF communication protocol is customized for suiting to the glucose monitoring system and achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate energy consumption of the sensor device and design energy harvesting units for the device. Finally, the work provides many advanced services at a gateway level such as a push notification service for notifying patient and doctors in case of abnormal situations (i.e. too low or too high glucose level). The results show that our system is able to achieve continuous glucose monitoring remotely in real-time. In addition, the results reveal that a high level of energy efficiency can be achieved by applying the customized nRF component, the power management unit and the energy harvesting unit altogether in the sensor device.",

Because the traditional healthcare mode is passive, by which patients call the healthcare service by themselves. Consequently, they usually fail to call the service if they are unconscious when the heart disease attacks. The Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have overwhelming superiority in solving the problem of heart diseases patients care as they can change the service mode into a pervasive way, and trigger the healthcare service based on patients’ physical status rather than their feelings. In order to realize the pervasive healthcare service, a remote monitoring system is essential. In this paper, we proposed a pervasive monitoring system that can send patients’ physical signs to remote medical applications in real time. The system is mainly composed of two parts: the data acquisition part and the data transmission part. The monitoring scheme (monitoring parameters and frequency for each parameter) is the key point of the data acquisition part, and we designed it based on interviews to medical experts. Multiple physical signs (blood pressure, ECG, SpO2, heart rate, pulse rate, blood fat and blood glucose) as well as an environmental indicator (patients’ location) are designed to be sampled at different rates continuously. Four data transmission modes are presented taking patients’ risk, medical analysis needs, demands for communication and computing resources into consideration. Finally, a sample prototype is implemented to present an overview of the system.",

In light of this securing traditional systems is still a challenging role requiring a mixture of solutions which may negatively impact, or simply, not scale to a desired operational level. Rule and signature based intruder detection remains prominent in commercial deployments, while the use of machine learning for anomaly detection has been an active research area. Behavior detection means have also benefited from the widespread use of mobile and wireless applications. For the use of smart defense systems we propose that we must widen our perspective to not only security, but also to the domains of artificial intelligence and the IoT in better understanding the challenges that lie ahead in hope of achieving autonomous defense. We investigate how intruder detection fits within these domains, particularly as intelligent agents. How current approaches of intruder detection fulfill their role as intelligent agents, the needs of autonomous action regarding compromised nodes that are intelligent, distributed and data driven. The requirements of detection agents among IoT security are vulnerabilities, challenges and their applicable methodologies. In answering aforementioned questions, a survey of recent research work is presented in avoiding refitting old solutions into new roles. This survey is aimed toward security researchers or academics, IoT developers and information officers concerned with the covered areas. Contributions made within this review are the review of literature of traditional and distributed approaches to intruder detection, modeled as intelligent agents for an IoT perspective; defining a common reference of key terms between fields of intruder detection, artificial intelligence and the IoT, identification of key defense cycle requirements for defensive agents, relevant manufacturing and security challenges; and considerations to future development. As the turn of the decade draws nearer we anticipate 2020 as the turning point where deployments become common, not merely just a topic of conversation but where the need for collective, intelligent detection agents work across all layers of the IoT becomes a reality.",

ICBFLT formulates summaries of CBL cases through synergy between students' and medical expert knowledge. The low cost and reduced size of sensor device, support of IoTs, and recent flipped learning advancements can enhance medical students' academic and practical experiences.

abstract = "One of the hottest topics in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain relates to the ability of enabling computation and storage at the edges of the network. This is becoming a key feature in order to ensure the ability of managing in a scalable way service requests with low response times. This means being able to acquire, store, and process IoT-generated data closer to the data producers and data consumers. In this scenario, also security and privacy solutions must be applied in a capillary way at the edges of the network. In particular, a control on access to data generated by IoT devices is necessary for guaranteeing proper levels of security and privacy as well as for preventing violation attempts, while allowing data owners to monitor and control their information. In this paper, a sticky policy approach is proposed as a strategy for efficiently managing the access to IoT resources within an existing distributed middleware architecture. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, sticky policies represent a promising and efficient technique to increase the robustness (in a security perspective) of the IoT system.",

These applications provide a platform to millions of people to get health updates regularly for a healthier lifestyle. Induction of IoT devices in the healthcare environment have revitalized multiple features of these applications. The big data generated by IoT devices in healthcare domain is analyzed on the cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computation resources of handheld devices. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT basedm-healthcare monitoring disease diagnosing framework is proposed which predicts the potential disease with its level of severity. Key terminologies are defined to generate user-oriented health measurements by exploring the concept of computational sciences. The architectural prototype for smart student healthcare is designed for application scenario. The results are computed after processing the health measurements in a specific context. In our case study, systematic student perspective health data is generated using UCI dataset and medical sensors to predict the student with different disease severity. Diagnosis schemes are applied using various state-of-the-art classification algorithms and the results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the baseline methods for disease prediction.",

Particularly, with the development of Internet of Things, intersection controllers are regarded as smart agents which can communicate and coordinate with each other. In this regard, a cooperative game theoretic approach among agents is proposed to improve traffic flow with large network. Thereby, a distributed merge and split algorithm for coalition formation is presented. This algorithm is applied to find out how to incorporate with the cooperation among agents for dynamically controlling traffic light at intersections. Furthermore, we construct a traffic simulation framework to evaluate our approach. With various parameters for traffic density, our proposed system can effectively improve traffic flow in both uniform and non-uniform. In particular, by coordinating among controllers, the waiting time of vehicles at intersections can be reduced from 15% to 25% comparing with previous methods (e.g., Green Wave Coordination).",

Internet technologies and advancements in social interaction tools have led to an increase in the use of the crowd as a provider of business solutions. Yet, we have seen a mere fraction of the possibilities of crowdsourcing technologies. This is because most of the development, discussion, and research around crowdsourcing has focused on active-input crowdsourcing. However, the real transformative pressure will come from passive sources of data generated primarily by developing and growing sensor technologies. This next generation of crowdsourcing will be a game changer for entrepreneurial opportunities. As crowdsourcing systems proliferate, more input will be acquired from sensors, artificial intelligence, bots, and other devices. As a result of this explosion, the variety of product and service opportunities will swell as entrepreneurs become more aware of technologies merging—such as the combination of crowdsourcing, sensors, and big data into a new type of entrepreneurship: sensor-based entrepreneurship. The purpose of this research is to contribute by (1) clarifying the next generation of crowdsourcing and (2) developing and presenting a framework to help sensor-based entrepreneurs plan, develop, and map their new products and services.",

Even the simplest objects will become “smart” because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.",

However, fog computing is not a substitute but instead a powerful complement to the cloud computing. This paper focuses on studying the interplay and cooperation between the edge (fog) and the core (cloud) in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We first propose a three-tier system architecture and mathematically characterize each tier in terms of energy consumption and latency. After that, simulations are performed to evaluate the system performance with and without the fog involvement. The simulation results show that the three-tier system outperforms the two-tier system in terms of the assessed metrics.",

A typical DC/DC converter uses voltage feedback control or current feedback control. It is difficult to meet its output voltage and power targets and have its input impedance stay as close to the output impedance of the energy source as possible. The proposed feedforward quasi universal converter allows the input/output parameters of the DC to DC converter in the energy harvester to loosely follow the variation of the energy source output parameters. It controls the DC to DC converter input impedance and output voltage/power to vary within a range that meets the design targets by either adaptively or manually adjusting the circuit parameters. It also allows a system designer to trade off precision for flexibility/simplicity in each unit of the harvester to achieve an optimum design. This paper uses a boost converter to present the feedforward quasi universal converter concept, discusses the cases that may cause overvoltage/overcurrent conditions, and provides the analysis for choosing proper design parameters to avoid them.",

Specially that the internet is available to all our life aspects including educational system, health care, banking, commercial, industries, mobile applications, etc. The energy sector is one of the important domains to use the internet in the supply and demand sides. As the buildings consume two third of electricity globally, the real-time monitoring, by using the internet, is one of the key factors to manage the energy consumption and to optimize the buildings’ performance. Accordingly, the buildings’ systems have utilized the information technology’s revolution in the last decade in several manners. One of the very interesting synergies is that developing relationship between the energy monitoring and the Internet of Things (IoT) for most of buildings’ sensors, energy meters and building automation systems. These new technologies interact effectively with the Smart Home Energy Management System. It increases its value and ensures securing tangible benefits. As shown through the findings of this study, the level of buildings intelligence will significantly contribute the improvement of energy performance. Not only, the energy demand and the use of energy will be smartly efficient. As a result, the renewable energy systems in such smart homes will be a cost-effective option and the probability to build a net zero energy home becomes materialized and affordable economically. This paper reviews the latest technologies and telecommunication techniques that used in the homes to monitor energy performance. It also discusses a case study in Riyadh – Saudi Arabia about smart home’s technologies, and the impact of using the renewable energy to improve the energy performance compared to the energy benchmark. The main focus will be on the smart technologies; interface and integration of the meters, sensors and monitoring systems with the home energy management system (HEMS). The findings of this paper outline that the smart home in practice provides the ability to the house to be net zero energy building. Especially that it reduces the power demand and improve the energy performance by 37% better than ASHRAE standards for family villas sector.",

This methodology gave us the monitoring data from the stationary nodes deployed in the city to the mobile nodes on Public Transport buses and cars. The data of the air pollution particles such as gases, smoke and other pollutants is collected via sensors on the Public transport buses and the data is being analyzed when the buses and cars reach back to the source destination after passing through the stationary nodes around the city.

The extant literature is reviewed to identify and understand where and how the streams converge and diverge. A two-tiered thematic analysis with both semantic and latent theme analysis is employed. Our findings highlight five points of departure, as well as highlighting examples where both logics have been applied. The five points of departure are the differing conceptualisations of: Value-in-Use, Design of the Servitized Offering, Value Co-production and Value Co-creation, Contextual Variety and Complexity, and Business Model of Solutions and Outcomes.

abstract = "The United States needs to reimagine the basic principles of its telecommunications and information policy to fit an emerging society in which networking and intelligence are embedded into an increasing number of everyday things which constantly monitor and measure our lives. This emerging environment is an always-on, ubiquitous, integrated system comprised of the Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence/Intelligent Systems and the Intercloud, which act together as a single system, referred to here as the “Embedded Infosphere” (EI). This development is driving the latest stage – the third – in the evolution of U.S. communications policy. Each of the components of the EI presents unique challenges, but the greater concern is all of them acting in concert. These developments bring into focus many topics that have been outside the traditional communications policy envelope, and exceed the portfolios of existing agencies and institutions. This article envisions a new “EI policy space,” grounded in established societal values, and built on the experience of the previous stages. There are appropriate policy responses to each of the challenges, but these responses need to be seen in a holistic perspective, as they are all interconnected. Many of the issues such as privacy, security, consumer protection, and data stewardship are common across several elements. The larger goal is to establish a framework for an integrated policy structure which can address unpredictable emergent conditions, while allowing markets to flourish without unduly burdensome regulations, restrictions or uncertainties. This articles suggests a high-level analytical framework of criteria against which proposed EI policies can be measured. While there may be no “perfect” policies, some may be better (or worse) than others. It also offers a political process designed to incorporate the concept of the EI into national policy thinking. This approach should be implemented through a series of steps and should provide flexibility for development. The initial step is a process by which the EI can be acknowledged, its development analyzed, and the national interests institutionalized. The U.S. Senate has already initiated this process with the pending “DIGIT” Act, designed to bring together the core federal stakeholders and open a policy discourse which will be expanded over time to other key stakeholders. This should lead to the development of a national EI strategy. Since the EI is progressively global, the article suggests how both the normative and regulatory dimensions can be approached in the global context. It raises the possibility of a restructured ICANN “Empowered Community” as a possible venue for developing policies and recommendations in this area. It notes that since global unanimity is unlikely, non-governmental regimes will likely develop to address the unresolved policy interstices.",

abstract = "Our next generation of industry—Industry 4.0—holds the promise of increased flexibility in manufacturing, along with mass customization, better quality, and improved productivity. It thus enables companies to cope with the challenges of producing increasingly individualized products with a short lead-time to market and higher quality. Intelligent manufacturing plays an important role in Industry 4.0. Typical resources are converted into intelligent objects so that they are able to sense, act, and behave within a smart environment. In order to fully understand intelligent manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper provides a comprehensive review of associated topics such as intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled manufacturing, and cloud manufacturing. Similarities and differences in these topics are highlighted based on our analysis. We also review key technologies such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, big data analytics (BDA), and information and communications technology (ICT) that are used to enable intelligent manufacturing. Next, we describe worldwide movements in intelligent manufacturing, including governmental strategic plans from different countries and strategic plans from major international companies in the European Union, United States, Japan, and China. Finally, we present current challenges and future research directions. The concepts discussed in this paper will spark new ideas in the effort to realize the much-anticipated Fourth Industrial Revolution.",

However, a practical route to powering these many IoT devices remains unclear. In this work, flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are fabricated from low cost, screen printed silver and nickel inks before being integrated into a novel form factor device based on commercial steam pipe insulation. Through optimization of internal resistances and total device design, this 420-junction TEG device produces 308µW of power at a temperature difference of 127K. This is sufficient to power a temperature sensing circuit with wireless communication capabilities. In this report we demonstrate that, after an initial 4 h of charging, this TEG can power a standard RFduino microcontroller for 10 min while sending temperature readings every 30 s via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a cell phone. Additional optimization and scaling could further increase system efficiency and provide a viable route to powering an industrial wireless sensing network (WSN).",

This paper also describes how biometrics can leverage cloud's boundless computational resources and striking properties of ﬂexibility, scalability, and cost reduction in order to reduce the cost of the biometrics system requirements of different computational resources (i.e. processing power or data storage) and to enhance the performance of biometrics systems’ processes (i.e. biometric matching).

In this study it is used as a remote enrollment node. The application of Raspberry Pi and cloud computing has given a new direction of research into the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Using the biometric technology, a new system of IoT based biometrics is proposed. To maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet channel from RPi client to the cloud, cryptographic algorithms are applied like RSA and enhanced AES-256. The encrypted biometric information is stored on the cloud and the authentication can be done by Biometric service hosted on Azure cloud.

A Smart City represents a new future framework, which integrates multiple information and communication technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, so as to improve the quality life of its citizens. However, there are many security and privacy issues which must be taken into account before the official launching of this new technological concept. Many methods which focus on media security of wireless sensor networks have been proposed and can be adopted in the new expandable network of IoT. In this paper, we describe the upcoming IoT network architecture and its security challenges and analyze the most important researches on media security and privacy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Subsequently, we propose an Efficient Algorithm for Media-based Surveillance System (EAMSuS) in IoT network for Smart City Framework, which merges two algorithms introduced by other researchers for WSN packet routing and security, while it reclaims the new media compression standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Experimental analysis shows the efficacy of our proposed scheme in terms of users’ privacy, media security, and sensor node memory requirements. This scheme can be successfully integrated into the IoT network of the upcoming Smart City concept.",

abstract = "The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g. high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next few years.",

On the other hand, although that cloud computing has served as an efficient way to process and store these data, however, challenges, such as the increasing demands of real time or latency-sensitive applications and the limitation of network bandwidth, still cannot be solved by using only cloud computing. Therefore, a new computing paradigm, known as fog computing, has been proposed as a complement to the cloud solution. Fog computing extends the cloud services to the edge of network, and makes computation, communication and storage closer to edge devices and end-users, which aims to enhance low-latency, mobility, network bandwidth, security and privacy. In this paper, we will overview and summarize fog computing model architecture, key technologies, applications, challenges and open issues. Firstly, we will present the hierarchical architecture of fog computing and its characteristics, and compare it with cloud computing and edge computing to emphasize the similarities and differences. Then, the key technologies like computing, communication and storage technologies, naming, resource management, security and privacy protection are introduced to present how to support its deployment and application in a detailed manner. Several application cases like health care, augmented reality, brain machine interface and gaming, smart environments and vehicular fog computing are also presented to further explain fog computing application scenarios. Finally, based on the observation, we propose some challenges and open issues which are worth further in-depth study and research in fog computing development.",

abstract = "The emerging paradigm of Machine to Machine (M2M)-driven Internet of Things (IoT), where physical objects are not disconnected from the virtual world but aim at collectively provide contextual services, calls for enhanced and more energy-efficient resource management approaches. In this paper, the problem is addressed through a joint interest, physical and energy-aware clustering and resource management framework, capitalizing on the wireless powered communication (WPC) technique. Within the proposed framework the numerous M2M devices initially form different clusters based on the low complexity Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), properly adapted to account for interest, physical and energy related factors. Following that, a cluster-head is selected among the members of each cluster. The proposed approach enables the devices of a cluster with the support of the cluster-head to harvest and store energy in a stable manner through Radio Frequency (RF) signals adopting the WPC paradigm, thus prolonging the operation of the overall M2M network. Each M2M device is associated with a generic utility function, which appropriately represents its degree of satisfaction in relation to the consumed transmission power. Based on the distributed nature of the M2M network, a maximization problem of each device's utility function is formulated as a non-cooperative game and its unique Nash equilibrium point is determined, in terms of devices’ optimal transmission powers. Considering the devices’ equilibrium transmission powers, the optimal charging transmission powers of the cluster-heads are derived. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via modeling and simulation and under various topologies and scenarios, and its operational efficiency and effectiveness is demonstrated.",

abstract = "The use of collaboration has recently started to spread to a wide range of services in modern wireless Ad-Hoc networks, for which it is offering valuable advantages in terms of optimization and resilience. However, allowing collaboration among wireless devices opens the way to a new class of threats that involve internal attackers. In this work, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing collaborative networking services in wireless networks and examine the new threats that are introduced by those collaborative mechanisms. From a study of the security measures proposed in the literature to counter these attacks, we identify two categories of countermeasures, namely security-by-design mechanisms and Trust Management Systems (TMSs). A specific discussion is devoted in this paper to the latter category, which offers the advantage of being more flexible. Aiming at further improving this flexibility by making the design of TMSs adapted to the advent of the Internet of Things, we propose a set of guidelines in order for these systems to fit the new requirements of modern wireless communications.",

This vision has been further expanded in the Internet of Things (IoT) era to embrace multipurpose resources within a smart city setup such as public sensors on roads/vehicles, cameras, RFID tags, and readers. The realization of such a prophecy is significantly challenged in terms of connectivity disruption, resource management, and data gathering under mobile conditions. In this paper, we present a hybrid pervasive sensing framework for data gathering in IoT-enabled smart-cities’ paradigm. This framework satisfies service-oriented applications in smart cities where data is provided via data access points (APs) of various resources. Moreover, public vehicles are used in this work as Data Couriers (DCs) that read these APs data packets and relay it back to a base-station in the city. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid fitness function for a genetic-based DCs selection approach. Our function considers resource limitations in terms of count, storage capacity and energy consumption as well as the targeted application characteristics. Extensive simulations are performed and the effectiveness of the proposed approach has been confirmed against other heuristic approaches with respect to total travelled distances and overall data-delivery cost.",

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena.",

However, urban problems, e.g., environmental pollution, resources shortage, and traffic jam, have been more and more serious for urban management and development. Smart city has been put forward as an effective approach to achieve better urban management recently. Smart city aims to realize the integration of municipal service, business, transportation, water, energy source and other urban sub-systems through close combination of human wisdom and information communication techniques (ICTs). As a result, the link and synergy of information could be ultimately established with ICTs, e.g., internet, internet of things, cloud computing. Yet, few studies have been conducted to systematically link smart city with big data in China. This paper aims to put forward a development framework of smart city with Chinese characteristics against the background of big data. Key actions, including rational planning of city infrastructures, the establishment and improvement of long-acting mechanism, the effective performance of city managerial function, are proposed to realize the development idea. Meanwhile, this paper also investigates the risks embedded in development of smart city with Chinese characteristics, e.g., information safety, weak emergency responding capacity and poor independent research and development capacity of core technology. This study can facilitate Chinese local governments to systematically plan smart city before clinging the hot concept in a rush.",

Novel biosensing methodologies offer highly specialised monitoring devices for the specific measurement of individual and multiple parameters covering an animal's physiology as well as monitoring of an animal's environment. These devices are not only highly specific and sensitive for the parameters being analysed, but they are also reliable and easy to use, and can accelerate the monitoring process. Novel biosensors in livestock management provide significant benefits and applications in disease detection and isolation, health monitoring and detection of reproductive cycles, as well as monitoring physiological wellbeing of the animal via analysis of the animal's environment. With the development of integrated systems and the Internet of Things, the continuously monitoring devices are expected to become affordable. The data generated from integrated livestock monitoring is anticipated to assist farmers and the agricultural industry to improve animal productivity in the future. The data is expected to reduce the impact of the livestock industry on the environment, while at the same time driving the new wave towards the improvements of viable farming techniques. This review focusses on the emerging technological advancements in monitoring of livestock health for detailed, precise information on productivity, as well as physiology and well-being. Biosensors will contribute to the 4th revolution in agriculture by incorporating innovative technologies into cost-effective diagnostic methods that can mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of infectious outbreaks in farmed animals.",

Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.",

One of such networks is composed of millions of sensors connected to the Internet which is called Internet of Things (IoT). With the advances in wireless communication technologies, multimedia sensors and their networks are expected to be major components in IoT. Many studies have already been done on wireless multimedia sensor networks in diverse domains like fire detection, city surveillance, early warning systems, etc. All those applications position sensor nodes and collect their data for a long time period with real-time data flow, which is considered as big data. Big data may be structured or unstructured and needs to be stored for further processing and analyzing. Analyzing multimedia big data is a challenging task requiring a high-level modeling to efficiently extract valuable information/knowledge from data. In this study, we propose a big database model based on graph database model for handling data generated by wireless multimedia sensor networks. We introduce a simulator to generate synthetic data and store and query big data using graph model as a big database. For this purpose, we evaluate the well-known graph-based NoSQL databases, Neo4j and OrientDB, and a relational database, MySQL.

In 2012, Big Data passed the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle, attesting the maturity level of this technology and its applications. The aim of this paper is to examine how do researchers grasp the big data concept? We will answer the following questions: How many research papers are produced? What is the annual trend of publications? What are the hot topics in big data research? What are the most investigated big data topics? Why the research is performed? What are the most frequently obtained research artefacts? What does big data research produces? Who are the active authors? Which journals include papers on Big Data? What are the active disciplines? For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on eight dimensions, including the SMACIT (Social Mobile Analytics Cloud Internet of Things) perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a systematic mapping study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications. The results have shown that significant contributions have been made by the research community, attested by a continuous increase in the number of scientific publications that address Big Data. We found that researchers are increasingly involved in research combining Big Data and Analytics, Cloud, Internet of things, mobility or social media. As for quality objectives, besides an interest in performance, other topics as scalability is emerging. Moreover, security and quality aspects become important. Researchers on Big Data provide more algorithms, frameworks, and architectures than other artifacts. Finally, application domains such as earth, energy, medicine, ecology, marketing, and health attract more attention from researchers on big data. A complementary content analysis on a subset of papers sheds some light on the evolving field of big data research.",

The interactions between humans and machines are intense and their synergistic reactions have attracted special attention for the reason of forming so called Human–Machine Networks (HMN). HMNs refer to these networks where humans and machines work together to provide synergistic effects on their payoffs. Game theory, which can capture the interactions among players dexterously, has been widely used in solving various problems in HMN systems from the view of economics. In this paper, we extensively review the literature about game theoretical methods in HMNs, in particular focusing on its typical systems such as crowdsourcing, an elemental HMN and Internet of Things (IoT), a hybrid HMN, as well as Bitcoin. We propose a series of requirements to evaluate existing work. For reviewing and analyzing each system, we specify application purposes, players, strategies, game models and equilibria based on our proposed requirements. In the sequel, we identify a number of common and distinct open issues in HMNs and point out future research directions.",

An improvement in electronic sensing devices and rapid growth in communication infrastructure, and their monitoring systems give very fast access to retrieve data and allow communication with physical devices. Now days, Organizations use IoT devices to collect real time and continuous data and make better business decisions to increase customer satisfaction. But collected data need to be processed and transferred in appropriate format to store on storage system – which is triggering organizations to rethink their data storage infrastructures. An enterprise has to store data generated from the Internet of Things and this data grows exponentially, it forces to think about cloud storage for storing IoT data.

The potential of this technology is evident in different domains. In Cultural Heritage (CH), it may enhance access to CH collections, in order to ensure a more engaging visit experience and to increase the appropriation of CH content by visitors. So far, research on IoT has primarily focused on technical features of smart objects (e.g., how to program sensors and actuators), while there are very few approaches trying to facilitate the adoption of such a technology by end users. This lack limits the social and practical benefits of IoT; it creates barriers in all those usage scenarios where people would like to define the behavior of smart objects but they might not have the required programming skills. This is becoming evident in CH sites, where different stakeholders would benefit from managing ecosystems of interoperable smart objects to create enhanced visit experiences. This article presents a visual composition paradigm that allows non-programmers to synchronize the behavior of smart objects, thus determining more engaging user experiences. It discusses how the paradigm suites the need of curators and guides of CH sites to define smart visit experiences through which visitors can acquire CH content by interacting with the surrounding environment and the smart objects included in it. A serious game designed with professional guides of CH sites is used as a case study to show the potential of the presented approach.",

abstract = "Most real samples cannot directly be infused to mass spectrometers because they could contaminate delicate parts of ion source and guides, or cause ion suppression. Conventional sample preparation procedures limit temporal resolution of analysis. We have developed an automated liquid–liquid extraction system that enables unsupervised repetitive treatment of dynamic samples and instantaneous analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). It incorporates inexpensive open-source microcontroller boards (Arduino and Netduino) to guide the extraction and analysis process. Duration of every extraction cycle is 17 min. The system enables monitoring of dynamic processes over many hours. The extracts are automatically transferred to the ion source incorporating a Venturi pump. Operation of the device has been characterized (repeatability, RSD = 15%, n = 20; concentration range for ibuprofen, 0.053–2.000 mM; LOD for ibuprofen, ∼0.005 mM; including extraction and detection). To exemplify its usefulness in real-world applications, we implemented this device in chemical profiling of pharmaceutical formulation dissolution process. Temporal dissolution profiles of commercial ibuprofen and acetaminophen tablets were recorded during 10 h. The extraction-MS datasets were fitted with exponential functions to characterize the rates of release of the main and auxiliary ingredients (e.g. ibuprofen, k = 0.43 ± 0.01 h−1). The electronic control unit of this system interacts with the operator via touch screen, internet, voice, and short text messages sent to the mobile phone, which is helpful when launching long-term (e.g. overnight) measurements. Due to these interactive features, the platform brings the concept of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to the chemistry laboratory environment.",

As part of CIP, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is defined as the process of gathering basic information that allows detecting, locating and quantifying vulnerabilities early on (fatigue cracking, degradation of boundary conditions, etc.) thereby improving, the resilience of the CI. Recent advances in electronics, wireless communication and software are expected to open the door to a new era of densely connected devices sharing information worldwide, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), in which Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role. The combined use of IoT/WSNs together with industrial sensors in SHM provide an ad-hoc, inexpensive and easy way of deploying a monitoring system, where data can be shared among different entities. SHM requirements are challenging and diverse and therefore several different technologies may be used in the same deployment. At the same time the use of a middleware can substantially simplify and speed up the development of applications for SHM. Taking into account the challenges of SHM systems, this paper provides a review of the most novel and relevant wireless technologies and a state-of-the-art middleware for WSNs focusing on SHM specific requirements.",

Most research, to a large extent, focus on requesting data, which is based on user inference and decision making, by utilising provenance information. However, little or nothing has been done regarding requests and responses and, most importantly, from the machine perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes a light-weight prototype system for tracing the source of requests/responses using provenance information over CoAP in the Internet of Things. We also provide performance evaluation of the prototypic system using metrics such as response time (ms) and throughput (KB/s). Finally, findings from our experiment are presented and discussed.",

With the proliferation of cloud computing and the increasing needs in analytics for big data such as data generated by the Internet of Things, verification of data integrity becomes increasingly important, especially on outsourced data. Therefore, research topics on external data integrity verification have attracted tremendous research interest in recent years. Among all the metrics, efficiency and security are two of the most concerned measurements. In this paper, we will bring forth a big picture through providing an analysis on authenticator-based data integrity verification techniques on cloud and Internet of Things data. We will analyze multiple aspects of the research problem. First, we illustrate the research problem by summarizing research motivations and methodologies. Second, we summarize and compare current achievements of several of the representative approaches. Finally, we introduce our view for possible future developments.",

These embedded software systems are increasingly autonomous and connected, and can thus be modeled as multiagent systems (MAS). Only 30 years ago it was science fiction that over a billion people will exchange billions of e-mails on a daily basis. Today a scenario of millions of collaborating agents sometimes embedded in gadgets and appliances, sometimes in form of networked and big data services, may also sound futuristic. However given the current rate of development in electronics, we will soon have to manage large scale MAS where millions of agents exist, collaborate and compete. Organization theory provides the necessary methodology to approach complex systems in order to design, implement and strategically manage them towards success.

To mitigate the effect, gardening (to plant trees and shrubs) becomes more and more important than just a hobby. Besides, maintenance of a garden is a tedious process and also time-consuming. Often the gardener lacks in knowledge about the requirements of plant (nutrient and the amount of water to be sprayed) to enhance its growth. In this regard, it is necessary to build an autonomous gardening robotic vehicle which automatically identifies and classifies the plant species using feature extraction algorithms (Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)) and neural networks, respectively. It also measures the key parameters for gardening such as temperature, humidity, heat level, wind speed, wind direction and soil moisture. The data acquired from the on-board sensors of the gardening rover are sent to the cloud storage platform on a regular basis. Based on the acquired data and history, future predictions are made to maintain the garden more effectively and efficiently. A website and an android application are developed for monitoring and controlling the rover from a remote area. This system is a combination of new technologies involving an interdisciplinary approach to carry out precision gardening using Internet of Things (IoT).",

abstract = "Falls can cause serious traumas such as brain injuries and bone fractures, especially among elderly people. Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery.",

Therefore, big data analytics is expected to contribute significantly to the advancement of smart manufacturing. In this work, a roadmap of statistical process monitoring (SPM) is presented. Most recent developments in SPM are briefly reviewed and summarized. Specific challenges and potential solutions in handling manufacturing big data are discussed. We suggest that process characteristics or feature based SPM, instead of process variable based SPM, is a promising route for next generation SPM and could play a significant role in smart manufacturing.

abstract = "Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.",

Every networking device is being connected to the Internet to develop specific and dedicated applications. Data from these devices, called as IoT devices, is transmitted to the Internet through IoT Gateways (IGWs). IGWs support all the technologies in an IoT network. In order to reduce the cost involved with the deployment of IGWs, specialized low-cost devices called Solution Specific Gateways (SSGWs) are also employed alongside IGWs. These SSGWs are similar to IGWs except they support a subset of technologies supported by IGWs. A large number of applications are being designed which require IGWs and SSGWs to be deployed in remote areas. More often than not, gateways in such areas have to be run on battery power. Hence, power needs to be conserved in such networks for extending network life along with maintaining total connectivity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spanning tree based algorithm for power-aware connectivity called SpanIoTPower-Connect which determines (near) optimal power consumption in battery-powered IoT networks. SpanIoTPower-Connect computes the spanning tree in the network in a greedy manner in order to minimize the power consumption and achieve total connectivity. Additionally, we propose an algorithm to conserve power in dynamic IoT networks where the connectivity demand changes with time. Our simulation results show that our algorithm performs better than Static Spanning Tree based algorithm for power-aware connectivity (Static ST) and a naive connectivity algorithm where two neighboring SSGWs are connected through every available technology. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt at achieving power-aware connectivity in battery-powered dynamic IoT networks.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm attracting significant attention in the modern wireless telecommunications field. However, in some scenarios, the performance of IoT network is limited by energy-constrained devices. In order to improve the energy efficiency of such IoT devices, researchers have proposed several approaches based on duty cycle operation (switching devices between sleeping and active mode). However, current solutions adopting duty cycle (i.e., the fraction of time in which a node is active) have three issues: (i) they assign the same duty cycle ratio to all the nodes without balancing energy consumption; or (ii) they distribute different duty cycle ratios without considering the energy consumption during network construction phase; or (iii) their network structure models are based on concentric corona, instead of clustering structure. In this paper, we propose EnergIoT, a hierarchical clustering approach based on duty cycle ratio to maximize network lifetime of battery-powered IoT devices. In particular, we assign different duty cycle ratios to devices according to their distance from the sink, since different duty cycle ratios balance the energy consumption among devices at different layers. Furthermore, we calculate the energy consumption of IoT devices, considering both network construction phase and data processing phase. We evaluate EnergIoT through extensive simulation analyses on the OMNet++ platform. The result shows that EnergIoT is not only feasible but also efficient. Moreover, EnergIoT improves the network lifetime by 32%, compared to the uniform duty cycle approach, without sacrificing the network performance (i.e., end-to-end delay).",

The landscape of these applications encountering big data needs to be replotted on cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources of small devices. However, with the rapid increase in the number of Internet-connected devices, the increased demand of real-time, low-latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional cloud computing framework. Although, fog computing, by providing elastic resources and services to end users at the edge of network, emerges as a promising solution, but the upsurge of novel social applications such as crowd sensing has fostered the need for scalable cost-efficient platforms that can enable distributed data analytics, while optimizing the allocation of resources and minimizing the response time. Following the existing trends, we are motivated to propose a fog computing based scheme, called MIST (i.e. a cloud near the earth's surface with lesser density than fog), to support crowd sensing applications in the context of IoT. For cost-efficient provisioning limited resources, we also jointly investigate data consumer association, task distribution, and virtual machine placement towards MIST. We first formulate the problem into a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and then linearise it into a mixed integer linear program (MILP). A comprehensive evaluation of MIST is performed by consideration of real world parameters of the Tehran province, the capital of Iran. Results show that as the number of applications demanding real-time service increases, the MIST fog-based scheme outperforms traditional cloud computing.",

To protect construction workers and prevent accidents in such sites, this paper proposes a novel design for an autonomous system that monitors, localizes, and warns site laborers who avail within danger zones. The proposed system is user-friendly, and its architecture is based on Internet of Things (IoT). The heterogeneous components of this architecture are seamlessly integrated into a middleware backend online server. To accurately detect and identify construction workers, the proposed system employs three combined techniques. They are 1) the 868MHz radio frequency, 2) directional antennas, and 3) the 40kHz ultrasound waves. Vehicle's rear is secured by a sensing unit that ensures good coverage along with a wearable device for workers. The design of the wearable device includes a set of components which are a radio transceiver (transmitter/receiver), a wake-up sensor, an alarm actuator, and a GPRS module. The wearable device has a power saving scheme with a current consumption as low as 0.5μA at 3V supply; thanks to our RF wake-up sensor. Via proximity, this wearable device becomes hybrid (active/passive) in which it remains in deep sleep mode until the presence of a radio frequency (RF) field. Consequently, the rechargeable battery's life gets increased by up to 2days of autonomy before recharging. Furthermore, the paper presents an implementation of wireless nodes that are powered by light energy using photovoltaic cells. These nodes adopt energy management and storage schemes for continuous operation for indoor and outdoor environments.",

Higher energy consumption result in a rise in the carbon dioxide emissions into the environment, and exposure to greater amount of harmful radiations.

This paper presents a survey on various energy-efficient scenarios for green communication, involving device-to-device (D2D) communication, spectrum sharing, ultra-dense networks (UDNs), massive MIMO, millimeter wave networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). For improving the battery lifetime of user terminals in a network, a three-layer architecture is proposed, which emphasizes on transmitting information through relays, between a given pair of users. The susceptibility of security attack on relays is also enumerated. As security in the networks cannot be overlooked, secure power optimization is studied, and the possible security attack on users within the small cell access point (SCA) of the 5G networks is proposed. Some of the key research challenges in association to green communication and security have been discussed, and the ongoing projects and standardization activities also stated in the paper.",

To this end, in this paper we study the impact that frequent TPC actions have across different layers. Our study shows how one node’s decision to scale its transmission power can affect the performance of both routing and MAC layers of multiple other nodes in the network, generating cascading packet retransmissions and forcing far too many nodes to consume more energy. We find that crucial objectives of TPC such as conserving energy and increasing network capacity are severely undermined in multi-hop networks.",

abstract = "This paper investigates the new trends in the field of “pervasive” or “ubiquitous” computing in logistics. Over the past two decades, research challenges in pervasive computing have evolved following the rapid progress of information and communication technology. Researchers are working to create an “Internet of Things” that globally interconnects smart devices and sensor networks. Technologies such as wireless communication, ubiquitous sensors, and passive or semi-passive RFID, are essential to monitor the transport chain. “Pervasive adaptation” is a new research challenge that has been recently introduced to describe system's ability to autonomously recognize the situation and adapt to situational changes. For example, it is expected that intelligent parcels that can observe and evaluate current environmental conditions including traffic information, velocity, new orders, temperature, or storage conditions, and decide adaptations such as changing transport route or destination and swapping vehicle. In order modern ubiquitous computing devices to become fully functional they need to overcome compatibility and security problems; these issues as well as potential solutions are explored in this paper. On the other hand, as new technology such as Ultra High Frequency RFID becomes more mature, it is launching into ubiquitous status in commerce and society.",

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",

Such technologies do not suffice on their own; rather they must be judiciously combined to deliver meaningful information in near real-time. Decision-support tools incorporating models of disparate farming activities, either on their own or in combination with other models, offer one popular approach; exemplars include GPFARM, APSIM, GRAZPLAN amongst many others. Such models tend to be generic in nature and their adoption by individual farmers is minimal. Smart technologies offer an opportunity to remedy this situation; farm-specific models that can reflect near real-time events become tractable using such technologies. Research on the development, and application of farm-specific models is at a very early stage. This paper thus presents an overview of models within the farming enterprise; it then reviews the state-of the art in smart technologies that promise to enable a new generation of enterprise-specific models that will underpin future smart farming enterprises.",

Tags such as this will be critical to the practical realisation of the Internet of Things. The tag is able to autonomously measure and store electrode potential in its internal memory, and then transfer logged data wirelessly by RFID to a nearby reader or by near field communication (NFC) to a smart phone. The unique features of the sensor tag include its ultra low-power consumption, potentiometric sensing ability, autonomous data logging, and RFID/NFC compatible air interface. These features make the tag suitable for use where pH or ion-selective electrodes are deployed as stand-alone chemical sensors or as part of larger chemical sensor networks that will underpin the IoT. pH determination in solution is used as an experimental example for illustrating measurement capability of the tag, and its analytical performance is compared to a standard laboratory pH meter.",

The design of such systems can be achieved by allowing the interaction between all their component objects (i.e., internet of things), which is one of the preoccupations of the researchers this last decade. However, using the multimedia sensor nodes for the internet of things (IoT) is problematic in term of power consumption, since these latter would be wireless and battery powered. Within the wider context of IoT, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) can be a promising technology for the aforementioned domains. However, in a such network, the captured data is usually voluminous and requires local processing, and thus, entailing a higher energy requirement. Therefore, the most important issue is to balance the video data coding versus the perceived video quality at the sink, while maximizing the overall network lifetime. To this end, we propose a fully distributed algorithm, that considers the problem of allocating the resources in wireless video sensor network, in a way to ensure a trade-off between both: the encoding power and the source rate at each node, while serving the desired video quality requirement. In opposition to existing approaches, our algorithm, of distributed nature, is provided to find such a trade-off whatever the initial network configuration is. In addition, a dynamic change of links capacity is considered with the limited transmission and reception powers. A new problem is then formulated to cope with the channel transmission error and it is solved.",

However, a safe-charging WPTN must also comply with the RF exposure regulations and keep electromagnetic radiation (EMR) under a predefined threshold. In this paper we consider the problem of maximizing the transmitted wireless power to the energy receivers with subject to the safety constraints. We introduce two fully-distributed charging algorithms where the energy transmitters communicate only with the sensors in their communication range to obtain their measurements, perform simple computation steps to adjust their power levels and and in turn satisfy safety constraints without any global information.",

Systems research in IoT is shifting priorities to explore explicit “thing architectures” that promote and enable the friction-free interactions of things despite such fragmentations. In this paper, we focus on overcoming light-weight communication protocol fragmentation. We introduce the Atlas IoT communication framework which enables interactions among things that speak similar or different communication protocols. The framework tools up Atlas things with protocol translator “attachments” that could be either hosted on board the Atlas thing platform, or in the cloud. The translator enables the seamless communication between heterogeneous things through a set of well-defined interfaces. The proposed framework supports seamless communication among the widely adopted Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Representational State Transfer (REST) over Hypertext Transfer protocol HTTP, and the Message Queue Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT). Our framework is carefully designed to facilitate interoperability among heterogeneously communicating things without taxing the performance of things that are homogeneously communicating. The framework itself utilizes the topic concept and uses a meta-topic hierarchy to map out and guide the translations. We present the details of the Atlas IoT communication framework and give a detailed benchmarking study to measure the energy consumption and code footprint characteristics of the different aspects of the framework on real hardware platforms. In addition to basic characterizations, we compare our framework to the Eclipse Ponte framework and show how our framework is advantageous in energy consumption and how it is unique in that it does not tangibly penalize the homogeneous communication case.",

However, the increased complexity of the IT networks that power today's healthcare organisations, as well as the sheer volume of data traversing these, has added to the challenge of ensuring network and data security, as Eileen Haggerty of Netscout explains.",

Edge computing is considered as a technology to enable new types of services which operate at the network edge. There are important use cases in ambient intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) for edge computing driven by huge business potentials. Most of today's edge computing platforms, however, consist of proprietary gateways, which are either closed or fairly restricted to deploy any third-party services. In this paper we discuss a participatory edge computing system running on home gateways to serve as an open environment to deploy local services. We present first motivating use cases and review existing approaches and design considerations for the proposed system. Then we show our platform which materializes the principles of an open and participatory edge environment, to lower the entry barriers for service deployment at the network edge. By using containers, our platform can flexibly enable third-party services, and may serve as an infrastructure to support several application domains of ambient intelligence.",

In this interconnected world, smart objects have an important role in giving users the chance for life-logging in smart environments. However, smart devices have several limitations with regards to memory, resources and computation power, hindering the opportunity to apply well-established security algorithms and techniques for secure life-logging on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The need for secure and trustworthy life-logging in smart environments is vital, thus, a lightweight approach has to be considered to overcome the constraints of Smart Objects. The purpose of this paper is to present in details the current topics of life-logging in smart environments, while describing interconnection issues, security threats and suggesting a lightweight framework for ensuring security, privacy and trustworthy life-logging. In order to investigate the efficiency of the lightweight framework and the impact of the security attacks on energy consumption, an experimental test-bed was developed including two interconnected users and one smart attacker, who attempts to intercept transmitted messages or interfere with the communication link. Several mitigation factors, such as power control, channel assignment and AES-128 encryption were applied for secure life-logging. Finally, research into the degradation of the consumed energy regarding the described intrusions is presented.",

Owing to the immense development of this technology, embedded devices are becoming more sophisticated every day and are being deployed in various arenas of life.

Integration of embedded devices and cloud servers brings wide applicability of IoT in many commercial as well as Government sectors. However, the security concerns such as authentication and data privacy of these devices play a fundamental role in successful integration of these two technologies. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based algorithms give better security solutions in comparison to other Public Key Cryptography (PKC) algorithms due to small key sizes and efficient computations. In this paper, a secure ECC based mutual authentication protocol for secure communication of embedded devices and cloud servers using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookies has been proposed. The proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and provides essential security requirements. The security analysis of the proposed protocol proves that it is robust against multiple security attacks. The formal verification of the proposed protocol is performed using AVISPA tool, which confirms its security in the presence of a possible intruder.",

Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system – the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) – and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the ‘missing link’ in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things.",

The method provides DoS and Sybil attack resistance and benefits from low communication cost, independence of prior sensor deployment knowledge and support for node mobility. The extension is simple in the sense that an interested node that joins the network is responsible to aggregate neighbors’ information and to send a request to the trusted party to get required keys. Our proposal reduces energy consumption about 75% vs. SNEP, 50% vs. BBF and 78% vs. OR, as three well-known previous schemes, which causes a significant increase in lifetime of nodes.",

Firstly, the data captured by smartphone sensors is categorized into groups by deep stacked autoencoders (SAE), which is a traditional deep learning architecture with multi-layer sparse autoencoders for feature extraction and a softmax layer for classification. For instance, accelerometer data from smartphones can be classified in accordance with different user motion states such as sitting, standing, walking, and running. Secondly, the quantitative correlation between divided sensor data and individual health is built. For example, walking and running for a suitable amount of time are beneficial to human health. Finally, a simulation experiment is devised to verify the performance of the proposed method. A 0.15 percent gain on the overall classification accuracy for automatic feature extraction on the human action recognition (HAR) dataset has been achieved compared with the state of the art methods and 0.5 percent gain for manual feature extraction. It is also demonstrated by the experimental results that smartphone sensor data can reveal the health status of the user to some degree and smartphone can serve as an assistant for human health.",

In this paper, we analyze this issue by contemplating the concept of IoT and drawing an inspiration towards the perspective vision of ‘Internet of Multimedia Things’ (IoMT). Therein, we introduce IoMT as a novel paradigm in which smart heterogeneous multimedia things can interact and cooperate with one another and with other things connected to the Internet to facilitate multimedia based services and applications that are globally available to the users. Some applications and use-cases for IoMT are presented to reflect the possibilities enabled by this new paradigm. An IoMT architecture is then presented which is segregated into four distinct stages; (i) multimedia sensing, (ii) reporting and addressability, (iii) multimedia-aware cloud, and (iv) multi-agent systems. Instead of proposing specific technical solutions for each individual stage of the presented architecture, we survey the already existing technologies, providing a synthesis for the realization of the vision of IoMT. Subsequently, various requirements and challenges as well as the feasibility of existing solutions for each stage of proposed IoMT architecture are comprehensively discussed.",

abstract = "The Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) is a wireless network that is designed to allow communication among sensor nodes that are attached to a human body to monitor the body’s vital parameters and environment. The design and development of such WBSN systems for health monitoring have received a large amount of attention recently, in research studies and in industry. This attention is mainly motivated by costly health care and by recent advances in the development of miniature health monitoring devices as well as emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which contribute to the main challenges of 5G. The existence of an explicit approach to address the required software design and verification should be very beneficial for the construction and maintenance of such systems. This paper presents a preventive health care system that has a flexible design. The proposed system is based on an architecture that has heterogeneous nodes and provides both daily continuous monitoring as well as specific controls. We defined a model to describe the WBSN’s global behavior. An important aspect of this work is that we propose a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to address the derivation of each node’s behavior in the WBSN from the WBSN global behavior. This approach allows developers to obtain a system design from the global specification of its requirement. To ensure the conformance of this design to its specification, the derived behaviors should be validated and verified before their deployment. In fact, formal methods are powerful tools for software engineers to verify the logical correctness of concurrent software at different levels of its life cycle. Model checking is one of the most powerful formal methods for verifying the logical correctness of such concurrent systems. In this work, we make use of a model checking approach that is based on a model transformation to validate the automatically derived behavior of a WBSN for health monitoring. This model-driven approach will check whether the derived system behaves correctly according to its global specification, while the objective is to increase the system’s performance and QoS. This approach allows the developer to reason about a model of the global system rather than about the system itself.",

Existing learning factories do not explicitly and properly consider IoT technology, which leads to deficiencies regarding an appropriate development of employees’ Industrial IoT competences.

IoT makes it possible to convert our homes to smart environments in which sensors are responsible for handling inhabitants’ behaviours and monitor their daily activities. Activity Recognition (AR) is a new service within smart homes. It has been introduced as a solution to improve the quality of life of people such as elderly and children. AR is concerned with the assignment of an activity label to a sequence of sensors’ events that are generated from the smart infrastructure. To help in effectively recognizing home activities, classification algorithms are applied on segmented sequences that are extracted automatically. Segments are subject to error due to the existence of irrelevant data and difficulties in how segmentation is applied. This negatively affects the accuracy on the classification task. In addition, the data generated from the network is streamed in nature, and big data techniques need to be utilized. In this paper, we propose a model to improve Activity Recognition in smart homes. The proposed technique is based on defining a profile for each activity from training datasets. The profile will be used to induce extra features and will help in distinguishing residents’ activities (fingerprinting). To validate our model, real datasets have been used for the experiments, and results show a significant enhancement in accuracy, compared with traditional techniques.",

As sensors represent a main component in the emergent domain of Internet of Things (IoT), these algorithms are expected to perform also well in this field while adapting to contextual changes and optimizing the use of the limited resources. In this paper, we propose a new firefly-based clustering approach for IoT applications. Our approach includes a micro clustering phase during which Real-World Things (RWTs) compete and self-organize into clusters. These clusters are then polished during a macro-clustering phase where they compete to integrate small neighboring clusters. We extend our approach to allow the IoT clusters to self-adapt by hiring and/or firing RWTs depending on ongoing events and their expected impact on the network and its current deployment area. Initial simulations are showing promising results where the number of clusters tends to stabilize independently from the density of the network and the various communication ranges of RWTs.",

In order to improve the efficiency of cloud infrastructure so that they can efficiently support IoT big data applications, it is important to understand how these applications and the corresponding big data processing systems will perform in cloud computing environments. However, given the scalability and complex requirements of big data processing systems, an empirical evaluation on actual cloud infrastructure can hinder the development of timely and cost effective IoT solutions. Therefore, a simulator supporting IoT applications in cloud environment is highly demanded, but such work is still in its infancy. To fill this gap, we have designed and implemented IOTSim which supports and enables simulation of IoT big data processing using MapReduce model in cloud computing environment.

abstract = "Progress in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is shaping more and more the healthcare domain. ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

It results in the availability of a huge amount of continuously acquired data which need to be processed to be more valuable. This leads to a real paradigm shift: instead of processing fixed data like classical databases or files, the new algorithms have to deal with data streams which bring their own set of requirements. Researchers address new challenges in the way of storing, querying and processing those data which are always in motion. In many decision making scenarios, fuzzy expert systems have been useful to deduce a more conceptual knowledge from data. With the emergence of the Internet of Things and the growing presence of cloud-based architectures, it is necessary to improve fuzzy expert systems to support higher level operators, large rule bases and an abundant flow of inputs. In this paper, we introduce a modular fuzzy expert system which takes data or event streams in input and which outputs decisions on the fly. Its architecture relies on both a graph-based representation of the rule base and the cooperation of four customizable modules. Stress tests regarding the number of rules have been carried out to characterize its efficiency.",

Currently, a number of research initiatives aim at addressing these shortcomings. Such an example is the “Future Internet” program launched by the European Commission.

The introduction of a high level of wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects, providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary curved surface over their stiff counterparts without incurring damage, emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force, temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization), further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory, signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major research frontiers in recent years. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art wearable tactile sensors concerning basic concepts, functional materials, sensing mechanism, promising applications, performance optimization strategies, multifunctional sensing, and system integration.

Since MCS applications generate large amounts of sensed data which is collected and preprocessed by devices with limited energy supply, challenges arise with respect to sensor management to ensure an energy-aware and quality-driven data acquisition process. In this paper we present a framework for Green Mobile Crowd Sensing (G-MCS) which utilizes a quality-driven sensor management function to continuously select the k-best sensors for a predefined sensing task. Our G-MCS solution utilizes a cloud-based architecture centered around a publish/subscribe communication model to enable the interaction of mobile devices with the cloud for energy-aware MCS. In particular, it obviates redundant sensor activity while satisfying sensing coverage requirements and sensing quality, and consequently reduces the overall energy consumption of an MCS application. We present a model for G-MCS and evaluate its energy savings for different application requirements and geographical sensor distribution scenarios. Furthermore, our model evaluation on a real data set shows that in certain identified cases, significant energy consumption reductions can be achieved by utilizing the proposed framework, which opens the door for green solutions within the area of MCS applications.",

In the recent years, low power communications has evolved towards multi-kilometer ranges and low bit-rate approaches such as LoRa™. However, the medium access layer protocols rely on the well-known duty-cycling schemes, which require a trade-off between power consumption and latency for message transfer from the gateway to the nodes. Domains such as industrial applications in which sensors and actuators are part of the control loop require predictable latency, as well as low power consumption. Emerging ultra-low-power wake-up receivers enable pure-asynchronous communications, allowing both low latency and low power consumption, but at the cost of a lower sensitivity and lower range than traditional wireless receivers and LoRa™. In this work, we propose an energy efficient architecture that combines long-range communication with ultra low-power short-range wake-up receivers to achieve both energy efficient and low latency communication in heterogeneous long-short range networks. A hardware architecture as well as a protocol is proposed to exploit the benefits of these two communication schemes. Experimental measurements and analytical comparisons show that the proposed approach remove the need for a trade-off between power consumption and latency.",

One of the most promising paradigms, which is inspired by business models and value propositions that have already been described in the PSS literature, is the concept of Circular Economy. Circular Economy is characterized as an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design and is attracting significant attention from researchers and policy makers alike. In light of the recent proliferation of digital technologies such as Big Data and the Internet of Things, this article attempts to identify how can digital technologies support the transition to Circular Economy. This article conducted a systematic review of the literature based on a review protocol, in an effort to evaluate the application of key digital technologies in Circular Economy. The study concludes by identifying research gaps, reflecting on the application of digital technologies in the field of PSS and proposing suggestions for future research.",

abstract = "In the era of Internet of things, wearable devices can be used to monitor residents’ health and upload collected health data to cloud servers for sharing, which facilitates the development of e-healthcare record (EHR) systems. However, before finding wide applications, EHR systems have to tackle privacy and efficiency challenges. For one thing, the confidentiality of EHRs is one of most important issues concerned by patients. For another, wearable devices in mobile cloud computing are often resource-constrained to some extent. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme which is proven secure in the standard model under the decisional parallel bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption. In the proposed scheme, an EHR owner can generate offline ciphertexts before knowing EHR data and access policies, which performs a majority of computation tasks. Furthermore, the online phase can rapidly assemble the final ciphertexts when EHR data and access policies become known. Our EHR access control scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes. Extensive performance comparisons and simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is very suitable for mobile cloud computing.",

abstract = "The future of logistics shipping bases will be to seek efficient flows of materials to meet the needs of business partners. Supply chain and operations managers of supply bases will need to integrate technologies that allow for greater automation, digitalization, flexibility and improved communications among stakeholders. The technologies that are likely to boost integration will consist of a plethora of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) technologies that may include Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and could be applied for improved monitoring of healthy and safe industrial workplaces for workers. However, little is known regarding how WSN technologies can be implemented on a larger scale and its implications when integrated on standard logistics and operations of industrial workplaces such as a shipping base. The WSN sensor units represent an integrating resource that are capable of monitoring air temperature, humidity and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gasses and of disseminating this information to different actors in the production system. Air quality factors play a critical role in the perceived levels of workers' comfort and in reported medical health. The low cost of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies offer potential for continuous, autonomous and importantly networked assessment of industrial workplace air quality that may have implications for operations management and quality of production. This paper initially presents a case study that monitors air quality that is collected with WSN technologies from two workshops carried out by a large on-shore logistics base that supports offshore petroleum logistics. The case study demonstrates a monitoring and visualization approach for facilitating BD in decision making for health and safety in the shipping industry. However, with the advancement in IIoT technologies and the emergence of smart sensing and actuating devices, it is possible to form a digital closed-loop system that we argue is essential for managers to link together information about air quality with supply chain and operations management decisions. We propose that central to effective decision making is the data analytics approach and visualization of what is potentially, big data (BD) in monitoring the air quality in industrial workplaces. We discuss how WSN technologies can be integrated into the logistics management and operations of the shipping base. Through an analytical discussion of BD we explore how to extend the potential application of IIoT and Visual Analytics to facilitate a smart workplace for the Industry 4.0 era.",

abstract = "The needs for efficient and scalable community health awareness model become a crucial issue in today’s health care applications. Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay.",

We analyze its security, proving that our protocol not only overcomes the weaknesses of Farash et al.’s protocol, but also preserves additional security attributes, such as the identity change and smartcard revocation phases. Moreover, the results of a simulation using AVISPA show that our protocol is secure against active and passive attacks.

IoT needs to support a multitude of heterogeneous objects extended with sensors, actuators, RFID’s, etc. These “Smart Objects” need unique identification, autonomous data transfer and communication with other objects. Consequently, these unique requisites of IoT need a promising future Internet architecture as it mostly revolves around data. Furthermore, the existing host-centric IP standards though advantageous, faces challenges like additional protocols for mobility, end-to-end security while deploying it with massive IoT applications. Named Data Networking (NDN) project is a new evolving data-centric internet architecture with innovative capabilities like caching, named data, security which mainly suits the specifications of IoT thereby proposed to solve the shortcomings of IP. NDN traditionally supports a PULL based traffic and its stateful forwarding engine despite its skillful nature need some modification while designing for an IoT system. In this paper, our foremost work is to classify and prioritize IoT traffic and enable delay-intolerant applications with low latency, to retrieve Data efficiently. Next, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based Interest scheduling for IoT traffic with varying priorities and measure the performance with different traffic probabilities. Our simulation results show that prioritizing and treating requests based on their traffic type can reduce network load by 30% thereby improving QoS in an IoT-NDN environment. The MDP-based IoT model schedules’ the Interest to the best interface efficiently reducing the RTT values on an average of 20%–30% than conventional forwarding strategies.

There are several factors to be considered in the design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying a suitable “Middleware” which sits between things and applications as a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and characteristics of middlewares.

In this paper we present UltraSense, an ultrasound-based room occupancy sensing system that relies on unsupervised learning, to automatically calibrate its parameters according to the room's environment. This ability avoids the need for manual calibration of the sensing system for each new environment. While commonly available occupancy detection technologies are limited to line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, UltraSense also operates in non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The proposed system was implemented and tested in order to characterize its performance.

abstract = "In the near future, it is envisioned that vehicular Ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be making use of long-distance communication techniques, such as cellular networks and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), to get instant Internet access for making the communication between vehicles and fixed road side infrastructure. Moreover, VANETs will also make use of short-distance communication methods, such as Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) to perform short range communication between vehicles in an ad hoc manner. This Internet connection can provide facility to other vehicles to send traffic related messages, collisions, infotainment messages other useful safety alerts. In such a scenario, providing authentication between vehicle to infrastructure and vehicle to vehicle is a challenging task. In order to provide this facility, in this paper, we propose a computationally efficient privacy preserving anonymous authentication scheme based on the use of anonymous certificates and signatures for VANETs in making them an important component of Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of smart cities. Even though there are several existing schemes available to provide such anonymous authentication based on anonymous certificates and signatures in VANETs, the existing schemes suffer from high computational cost in the certificate revocation list (CRL) checking process and in the certificate and the signature verification process. Therefore, it is not possible to verify a large number of messages in a particular period in VANETs which would lead to increased message loss. Hence, we use a computationally efficient anonymous mutual authentication scheme to validate the message source as well as to verify the integrity of messages along with a conditional tracking mechanism to trace the real identity of misbehaving vehicles and revoke them from VANET in the case of dispute. In this paper, we also introduce an efficient anonymous batch authentication protocol to be used in IoT for Road Side Units (RSUs) to authenticate multiple vehicles simultaneously rather than one after the other such that the total authentication time can be dramatically reduced. This proposed scheme is implemented and the performance analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient in terms of certificate and signature verification cost, while preserving conditional privacy in VANETs.",

Moreover, the increase in user mobility and unreliable sensor availability in IoT, necessitates the context-aware applications to dynamically adapt their behavior at run time. In this paper, we elicit the need for different self-learning techniques to tackle the openness of the IoT environments and propose enabling algorithms to achieve them. First, we present possible application scenarios which can benefit from both supervised and unsupervised self-learning. Later, we propose correlation mining algorithms based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and frequent set mining that exploits correlated contexts to enable unsupervised self-learning. These algorithms help to identify alternate sources for a context and semantically describe the previously unseen contexts in terms of already known contexts. We have realized the proposed algorithms on top of a Bayesian framework (HARD-BN) which supports autonomous learning. Our experiments demonstrate the applicability of the proposed correlation mining algorithms and their feasibility to enable self-learning in open and ever-evolving IoT environments.",

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure. Improved accuracies of classifiers on U2R and R2L attacks have been recorded in the experimental results obtained for experiments conducted.",

Many subsystems and heterogeneous elements intervene.

While previous research shows that business model affects the performance of entrepreneurial firms, there is still limited understanding about how likely different business model selections of Internet of Things (IoT) startup firms retain their value and whether the venture capital investment intensity does play any role in the business model’s value retention process. In this study, we suggest that the e-business model selections (i.e. novelty, efficiency, lock-in and complementarity) of an IoT mobile Application (App) may affect its value retention. Based on contingency theory, an organization must match its structure and decisions to its external environments. We propose that the venture capitalist’s involvement may moderate the strength of the relationship between e-business models and an IoT mobile App’s’ value retention. We have collected data from 470 start-ups in China. The results show that efficiency-centred and complementarities-centred e-business models increase while lock-in centred e-business model reduces the IoT mobile App’s value retention. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that the venture capitalist’s involvement does not help all types of e-business model’s value retention. The relationship between novelty centred e-business model and value retention is positively only when venture capital investment intensity is high. In contrast, the relationship between efficiency centred e-business model and value retention is positive only when venture capital investment intensity is low. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, and some limitations and future research directions are proposed.",

Today's vehicles have the capability of supporting real time multimedia acquisition. Vehicles with high illuminating infrared cameras and customized sensors can communicate with other on-road devices using dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and 5G enabled communication technologies. Real time incidence of both urban and highway vehicular traffic environment can be captured and transmitted using vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication modes. Video streaming in vehicular IoT (VSV-IoT) environments is in growing stage with several challenges that need to be addressed ranging from limited resources in IoT devices, intermittent connection in vehicular networks, heterogeneous devices, dynamism and scalability in video encoding, bandwidth underutilization in video delivery, and attaining application-precise quality of service in video streaming. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review on video streaming in IoT environments focusing on vehicular communication perspective. Specifically, significance of video streaming in vehicular IoT environments is highlighted focusing on integration of vehicular communication with 5G enabled IoT technologies, and smart city oriented application areas for VSV-IoT. A taxonomy is presented for the classification of related literature on video streaming in vehicular network environments. Following the taxonomy, critical review of literature is performed focusing on major functional model, strengths and weaknesses. Metrics for video streaming in vehicular IoT environments are derived and comparatively analyzed in terms of their usage and evaluation capabilities. Open research challenges in VSV-IoT are identified as future directions of research in the area. The survey would benefit both IoT and vehicle industry practitioners and researchers, in terms of augmenting understanding of vehicular video streaming and its IoT related trends and issues.",

abstract = "Our work stems from the consideration that nodes of a wireless sensor network, deployed on a general topology, should follow a bio-inspired approach to respect the trustability, information load, risk and energy-saving requirements, under bounded conditions of time, knowledge and computational power. It allows to introduce a multi-agent model related to Internet of Things and heuristics models, in order to obtain a smart organized network with nodes that have both social and human cognition. Our model is based on a hierarchical clustering method and an aggregation/rejection mechanism, that follows sociological and heuristics theories. The model follows the principle of sense of community and the logic of tie for similarity. The main target is to integrate the inherent cooperation of a multi-agent system with node intelligence of Internet of Things and also with the “Satisficing” of heuristic decisions in order to get a social smart behavior of the whole network.",

However, the adoption of IoT, increases the total volume of the generated data transforming the industrial data into industrial Big Data. The work demonstrated in this paper presents how the adoption of IoT in manufacturing, considering sensory systems and mobile devices, will generate industrial Big Data. Moreover, a developed IoT application is presented showing how real industrial data can be generated leading to Industrial Big Data.

WM involves a set of processes ranging from waste collection to the recycling of the collected materials. The proliferation of sensors and actuators enable the new era of Internet of Things (IoT) that can be adopted in SCs and help in WM. Novel approaches that involve dynamic routing models combined with the IoT capabilities could provide solutions that outperform existing models. In this paper, we focus on a SC where a number of collection bins are located in different areas with sensors attached to them. We study a dynamic waste collection architecture, which is based on data retrieved by sensors. We pay special attention to the possibility of immediate WM service in high priority areas, e.g., schools or hospitals where, possibly, the presence of dangerous waste or the negative effects on human quality of living impose the need for immediate collection. This is very crucial when we focus on sensitive groups of citizens like pupils, elderly or people living close to areas where dangerous waste is rejected. We propose novel algorithms aiming at providing efficient and scalable solutions to the dynamic waste collection problem through the management of the trade-off between the immediate collection and its cost. We describe how the proposed system effectively responds to the demand as realized by sensor observations and alerts originated in high priority areas. Our aim is to minimize the time required for serving high priority areas while keeping the average expected performance at high level. Comprehensive simulations on top of the data retrieved by a SC validate the proposed algorithms on both quantitative and qualitative criteria which are adopted to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We claim that, local authorities could choose the model that best matches their needs and resources of each city.",

The validation combines measurements on real test-beds running the targeted application and simulations on well-known simulators for studying the scaling-up with an increasing number of IoT devices.

The new wave of artificial super intelligence, exemplified by the evolution in big data and Internet of Things raise an issue of whether this evolution could and should exclude human intuition from human judgment, given its exclusive reliance on data driven certainty of algorithms, analytics, artificial and machine learning. How could we respond to the algorithmic wave of uneven accuracy, deal with uncertainty, ambiguity, conflicts, justifiable judgements, and seek alignment of data and knowledge. We are minded by Weizenbaum's argument (1976) that if human judgement is based on human observation (data) and intuition, then how can science which ultimately rests on a vast array of human value judgments, deny that human value judgments are illusionary? The paper reflects on the certainty of data driven singularity and argues for a relational conversation between technology and society.",

abstract = "Purpose
Big data is increasingly becoming a major organizational enterprise force to reckon with in this global era for all sizes of industries. It is a trending new enterprise system or platform which seemingly offers more features for acquiring, storing and analysing voluminous generated data from various sources to obtain value-additions. However, current research reveals that there is limited agreement regarding the performance of “big data.” Therefore, this paper attempts to thoroughly investigate “big data,” its application and analysis in operations or supply-chain management, as well as the trends and perspectives in this research area. This paper is organized in the form of a literature review, discussing the main issues of “big data” and its extension into “big data II”/IoT–value-adding perspectives by proposing a value-adding framework.
Methodology/research approach
The research approach employed is a comprehensive literature review. About 100 or more peer-reviewed journal articles/conference proceedings as well as industrial white papers are reviewed. Harzing Publish or Perish software was employed to investigate and critically analyse the trends and perspectives of “big data” applications between 2010 and 2015.
Findings/results
The four main attributes or factors identified with “big data” include – big data development sources (Variety – V1), big data acquisition (Velocity – V2), big data storage (Volume – V3), and finally big data analysis (Veracity – V4). However, the study of “big data” has evolved and expanded a lot based on its application and implementation processes in specific industries in order to create value (Value-adding – V5) – “Big Data cloud computing perspective/Internet of Things (IoT)”. Hence, the four Vs of “big data” is now expanded into five Vs.
Originality/value of research
This paper presents original literature review research discussing “big data” issues, trends and perspectives in operations/supply-chain management in order to propose “Big data II” (IoT – Value-adding) framework. This proposed framework is supposed or assumed to be an extension of “big data” in a value-adding perspective, thus proposing that “big data” be explored thoroughly in order to enable industrial managers and businesses executives to make pre-informed strategic operational and management decisions for increased return-on-investment (ROI). It could also empower organizations with a value-adding stream of information to have a competitive edge over their competitors.",

In this approach, the components are described and virtualized in a module communicating through two dedicated events, they are registered in a Resources Manager to facilitate the fine management of concurrent multimodal interactions, and the system supports an interoperable discovery, registration and filtering of the features provided by heterogeneous and dynamic components in the web of things.

abstract = "The recent development in the technology brings the concept of Smart City that is achieved through real-time city related intelligent decisions by analyzing the data harvested from various smart systems in the city using millions of sensors and devices connected over the Internet, termed as Internet of Things (IoT). These devices generate the overwhelming volume of high-speed streaming data, termed as Big Data. However, the generation of city data at a remote location and then transmitting it to central city servers for analysis purpose raises the concerns of security and privacy. On the other hand, providing security to such Big Data streaming requires a high-speed security system that can work in a real-time environment without providing any delay that may slow down the overall performance of the Smart City System. To overthrown these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Smart City security system by providing strong intrusion detection at intelligent city building (ICB) and also a security protocol to protect the communication between the remote smart system(RSS)/User and the city analysis building, i.e., ICB. The proposed communication security protocol consists of various phases, i.e., registration phase, session key exchange phase, session key revocation phase, and data transmission phases from RSS to ICB as well as from User to ICB. Vast security analyses are performed to evaluate the credibility of the system. The proposed system is also evaluated on efficiency in terms of computation cost and throughput of overall functions used in the system. The system’s evaluation and the comparative study with existing system show that the prosed system is secure, more efficient, and able to work in a real-time, high-speed Smart City environment.",

These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.",

By introducing crumpled morphology onto the gold thin film using macrocontrol, the TENG delivered a maximum voltage of 124.6 V, a maximum current of 10.13 μA and maximum power density of 0.22 mW/cm2. Importantly, the output performance was quite stable, with no obvious degradation after 6-month storage in ambient environment due to the reliability of Au films.

The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics.",

abstract = "Identifying potentially disruptive technologies is crucial to safeguarding competitive advantage by enabling stakeholders to assign resources in a manner that increases the chances of exploiting the disruption and/or mitigating the ensuing risks. However, disruptive technologies and emergent trends within known disruptive domains are mostly identified ex-post. This paper contributes to the ex-ante prediction of emergent technologies within disruptive domains by proposing a literature-driven method for the forecasting of potentially disruptive technological trends. It adopts a keyword network analysis and visualisation approach for uncovering emergent thematic, structural and temporal developments within publications and applies it as a forecasting tool to an empirical study of seven disruptive domains: 3D Printing, Big Data, Bitcoin, Cloud Technologies, Internet of Things, MOOCs and Social Media. Maturing trends were found to share influential common topics identified by high degree, betweenness and closeness centrality scores. Niche and potentially emerging trends within groups were detected by means of eccentricity and farness metrics. Visualisation techniques were found effective for further clarification and trend identification. Finally, potentially disruptive trends within domains were found to be associated with high closeness paired with low degree centrality. The findings were distilled into a framework for assisting the forecasting of potentially disruptive trends.",

These emerge from innovations in information technology that, while they create new economic and social opportunities, pose challenges to our security and expectations of privacy. Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and private, will access a web of interconnected data from GPS location to weather and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges. Their implementation is essential for a Smart City in which we would wish to live. We also present a model representing the interactions between person, servers and things. Those are the major element in the Smart City and their interactions are what we need to protect.",

A possible solution to reduce healthcare costs in a world that is aging is the adoption of telehealth technologies. Several solutions appeared, in the past suggesting the use of smart devices (mobile phones or tablets) for supporting telehealth. Unfortunately, elderly people may have difficulties in the use of such devices even if user interfaces are becoming friendly and intuitive. This work introduces the concept of “Smartstone”, that is the use of a (low-cost) smartphone as a simple, effective, and portable gateway/edge server for mobile healthcare towards cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The Smartstone is designed in order to minimize the user interaction, thanks to its autonomous behavior. The adoption of smart devices as a building block ensures state-of-the-art connectivity and relatively high computational power, complemented by an ensemble of additional onboard sensors. In particular, results about the management of a new photoplethysmographic /bio-impedance monitor and a smart pill dispenser are presented in this work.",

abstract = "Cold chain management is of importance for manufacturers in the food industry since they face the dilemma of having to choose between frozen storage and cool storage in delivering products to retailers or end-consumers. Frozen storage incurs high-energy consumption for the preservation of food products, whereas cool storage involves the constant threat of bacterial decay. Contemporary cold-chain development in temperature control usually focuses on single logistic chain rather than serving multiple channels. In order to overcome the aforementioned deficiency, this study proposes a time-temperature indicator (TTI) based cold-chain system, which uses wireless sensors for collecting temperature data and implements the formulation of Critical Control Point (CCP) criteria throughout the entire delivery process. In particular, this approach is based on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture as well as international food standards named ISO 22,000. More importantly, four new business models including (1) cold chain home-delivery service; (2) Convenience store (CVS) indirect delivery; (3) CVS direct delivery; (4) flight kitchen service, are successfully developed for conducting performance assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can increase annual sales of braised pork rice from 4.44 million bowls to over 6 million bowls, create more distribution channels to increase extra revenue of more than US$6.35 million, and reduce 10% energy consumption in central kitchens to enhance turnover of electricity from US$14.23 raised to US$18.64 per kilowatt hour.",

An infrastructure for Smart City has to be geographically and functionally extensible, as it requires both to grow up with the physical environment and to meet the increasing in needs and demands of city users/inhabitants. In this paper, we propose iSapiens, an IoT-based platform for the development of general cyber–physical systems suitable for the design and implementation of smart city services and applications. As distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge computing paradigm through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor and a distributed network of computing nodes directly scattered in the urban environment. The platform promotes the dynamic deployment of new computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing geographical and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator devices embedded in the system, and to support the development of complex applications. The paper also furnishes a set of methodological guidelines exploitable for the design and implementation of smart city applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant case study, the design and implementation of a real Smart Street in the city of Cosenza (Italy) are shown, which provides decentralized urban intelligence services to citizens.",

At the MAC level, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines a reservation mechanism called Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) that uses a first-come first-served service policy, which is not enough to ensure the real-time delivery of packets. In this work, we present a formal definition of the scheduling problem for a sensor network using a reservation mechanism (such as GTS) that provides guarantees for the real-time delivery of packets. We also present a heuristic approach for finding feasible schedules when possible or determining if the requirements of a set of sensors are not feasible.",

In this survey paper, we present an overview of research efforts on the integration of cyber-physical systems with cloud computing and categorize them into three areas: (1) remote brain, (2) big data manipulation, (3) and virtualization.

These initiatives lead to an urgent need to advance current manufacturing systems into a high level of intelligence and autonomy. As the main component of any manufacturing system, machine tools have evolved from manually operated machines into the current computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools. It is predicted that current CNC machine tools are not intelligent and autonomous enough to support the smart manufacturing systems envisioned by the aforementioned initiatives. Inspired by recent advances in ICT such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a new generation of machine tools, i.e. Machine Tool 4.0, as a future development trend of machine tools. Machine Tool 4.0, otherwise known as Cyber-Physical Machine Tool (CPMT), is the integration of machine tool, machining processes, computation and networking, where embedded computers and networks can monitor and control the machining processes, with feedback loops in which machining processes can affect computations and vice versa. The main components and functions of a CPMT are presented. The key research issues related to the development of CPMT are identified and discussed. A three-layer CPMT-centered Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) is proposed to illustrate both the vertical integration of various smart systems at different hierarchical levels and the horizontal integration of field-level manufacturing facilities and resources.",

Focusing on interrogations of engagement and social change posed by gaming theorists and designers, and using several flagship interactive games as points of reference, we discuss the elements of game space that make it capable of simulating complex systems and large-scale implications of energy decisions richly and effectively. We discuss social, technological, and narrative elements of game play, pairing a theoretical investigation with a practical exploration of how energy related games can link with data in the real world, with particular emphasis on the emerging Internet of Things. Our conclusions emphasise the importance of game simulation toward the longer-term goal of cultivating more complex patterns of interaction and cultural analysis around energy use; this is based on the assertion that energy, a social resource, must be managed in ways that are equally social.",

As IPv6 has become the de-facto communication technology for the Internet, 6LoWPAN has recently started paving the way for extending the Internet to low-power low-cost wireless devices. However, while mobility support will be a requirement (or at least beneficial) in many applications contexts, the support of mobile nodes in the default 6loWPAN/RPL protocol leads to excessive packet loss and delays. In this work, we show that interoperability between fixed and mobile nodes can be successfully achieved through the use of appropriate hand-off and topology management techniques. We propose a mobility management framework (dubbed mRPL+) unifying two hand-off models: (1) hard hand-off, where a mobile node has to break a link before finding a new link, and (2) soft hand-off, where a mobile node selects the new link before disconnecting from the current one. Importantly, mRPL+ is integrated in the 6LoWPAN/RPL stack in a backward compatible manner. Simulation results indicate that in a network with mobile nodes, packet delivery ratio with mRPL+ is nearly 100%, where RPL achieves 80% in best-case. Hand-off process has a disconnected period of few milliseconds (hand-off delay = 4 ms), while RPL experiences few seconds of disconnection during node’s mobility (3−10 s).",

The existing new data sources such as Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) influence many digital aspects in-order to shape/reshape normal life of people and other related parties such as businesses, stockholders etc. Urban mobility is one of the considerable impacted domains, where many applications and services have been provided by implicating user activities and other city information. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive view on the influence of various sources of data in the users’ trips. To this end, at first we review relevant studies and available services that are designed to facilitate travelers’ life as well as we identify the existing gaps in this domain. Next we propose a framework iTrip, which aims to utilize data from different data sources as input and then, recommend/provide advance services to various type of customers. The outcome of this framework will provide a set of summarized recommendations, predictions, decisions, and plans to be used in decision-making for long/short distance transportation mechanisms.

abstract = "Although study on outlier detection techniques has long been an area of much research, few of those works relate to an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. In the last few years, with the advent of IoT and its numerous smart objects, data generated from sensors have increased exponentially. Since on the basis of these data many critical decisions are taken, it is therefore necessary to absolutely ensure its accuracy, correctness and integrity before any processing starts. Most algorithms in the past assumes outliers to be always an Error, that is caused by a malfunctioning sensor. However, this is not always true because an outlier could also be an important event that should not be neglected. This stresses the need to devise algorithms that is suited for an IoT environment which considers both Error, that is a result of faulty sensors or an Event, which is an indication of an abnormal phenomenon. This paper proposes a sequence based learning approach for outlier detection that works for both Error and Event. Simulations are performed on few benchmark datasets, a medical dataset and a real world dataset obtained through an experimental test bed. The results reveal exceptionally high accuracies with up to 99.65% for Error detection and 98.53% for Event detection.",

The monitoring was effective and convenient in combination with the internet of things.

Research infrastructures (RIs) are essential to advance research on the relationship between food, nutrition, and health. RIs will facilitate innovation and allow insights at the systems level which are required to design (public health) strategies that will address societal challenges more effectively.
Approach
In the EuroDISH project we mapped existing RIs in the food and health area in Europe, identified outstanding needs, and synthesised this into a conceptual design of a pan-European DISH-RI. The DISH model was used to describe and structure the research area: Determinants of food choice, Intake of foods and nutrients, Status and functional markers of nutritional health, and Health and disease risk.
Key findings
The need to develop RIs in the food and health domain clearly emerged from the EuroDISH project. It showed the necessity for a unique interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder RI that overarches the research domains. A DISH-RI should bring services to the research community that facilitate network and community building and provide access to standardised, interoperable, and innovative data and tools. It should fulfil the scientific needs to connect within and between research domains and make use of current initiatives. Added value can also be created by providing services to policy makers and industry, unlocking data and enabling valorisation of research insights in practice through public-private partnerships. The governance of these services (e.g. ownership) and the centralised and distributed activities of the RI itself (e.g. flexibility, innovation) needs to be organised and aligned with the different interests of public and private partners.",

The combination of a massive amount of available data and advanced machine learning models brings new opportunities for bearing remaining useful life prediction. This paper proposes an integrated deep learning approach for multi-bearing remaining useful life collaborative prediction by combining both time domain features and frequency domain features. The method can extract high-quality degradation patterns of rolling bearing from vibration signals. Regarding features extracted from bearing vibration signals, in addition to three conventional time domain features, a novel frequency domain feature is adopted in the proposed method as well. Based on the extracted features, the deep neural network model is introduced to predict the remaining useful life of rolling bearing. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a real dataset and compare it with several commonly used shallow prediction methods Numerical experiment results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",

In this paper we propose an alternative to model expected exceptions, allowing the process modeler to focus on the right process. We propose the process invariants concept, which allows a process modeler to deﬁne a set of conditions that must remain valid within a process scope.

abstract = "Introduction
Smart watches have the potential to support health in everyday living by: enabling self-monitoring of personal activity; obtaining feedback based on activity measures; allowing for in-situ surveys to identify patterns of behavior; and supporting bi-directional communication with health care providers and family members. However, smart watches are an emerging technology and research with these devices is at a nascent stage.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of smart watch studies that engaged people in their use by searching PubMed, Embase, IEEE XPlore and ACM Digital libraries. Participant demographics, device features, watch applications and methods, and technical challenges were abstracted from included studies.
Results
Seventy-three studies were returned in the search. Seventeen studies published were included. Included studies were published from 2014 to 2016, with the exception of one published in 2011. Most studies employed the use of consumer-grade smart watches (14/17, 82%). Patient-related studies focused on activity monitoring, heart rate monitoring, speech therapy adherence, diabetes self-management, and detection of seizures, tremors, scratching, eating, and medication-taking behaviors. Most patient-related studies enrolled participants with few exclusion criteria to validate smart watch function (10/17, 58%). Only studies that focused on Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and diabetes management enrolled persons living with targeted conditions. One study focused on nursing work in the ICU and one focused on CPR training for laypeople.
Conclusion
Consumer-grade smart watches have penetrated the health research space rapidly since 2014. Smart watch technical function, acceptability, and effectiveness in supporting health must be validated in larger field studies that enroll actual participants living with the conditions these devices target.",

abstract = "Smart cities are comprised of diverse and interconnected components constantly exchanging data and facilitating improved living for a nation's population. Our view of a typical smart city consists of four key components, namely, Smart Grids, Building Automation Systems (BAS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Smart Vehicles; with enabling Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and the Cloud platform. The adversarial threats and criminal misuses in a smart city are increasingly heterogenous and significant, with provisioning of resilient and end-to-end security being a daunting task. When a cyber incident involving critical components of the smart city infrastructure occurs, appropriate measures can be taken to identify and enumerate concrete evidence to facilitate the forensic investigation process. Forensic preparedness and lessons learned from past forensic analysis can help protect the smart city against future incidents. This paper presents a holistic view of the security landscape of a smart city, identifying security threats and providing deep insight into digital investigation in the context of the smart city.",

There are number of issues related to mining twitter for disease information including, filtering noisy information, establishing dictionary of terms to be used, sentiment analysis and establishing authenticity. In this project, we plan to develop a framework for mining and extracting information from twitter related to disease outbreaks. The system makes use of numerous programming interfaces as part of the framework to identify and notify the user of pertinent health related issues in a geographical area of interest. The framework is part of a smart home dashboard system that notifies the user about disease outbreak information.

The devices can perform two different functions: (i) act as wireless sensing nodes to monitor environmental parameters inside the server room that are important for system reliability and security; (ii) provide active cooling to the CPUs of the data center as smart heat-sinks. Starting from the empirical characterization of the energy harvesting module, we determine the amount of energy that can be harvested from a CPU heat dissipation while performing different tasks. We then analyze the amount of energy required to supply the low power sensors or to actuate the cooling fan. The CPS exploits a software simulator of the network of smart heat-sinks to predict the status of the devices. The simulator works in conjunction with a management algorithm used to administrate the cloud infrastructure and the network of smart heat-sinks for pursuing global objectives, i.e., maximizing the power efficiency of the data center, while keeping the wireless sensing network alive. Experimental data and simulation results of the framework validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Our approach consists of four main phases: (i) definition of the basic steps of a methodology for run-time safety management; (ii) development of an ontological knowledge-base of safety in work environments; (iii) definition of constraints on the ontology based on organizations’ safety protocols; (iv) communication of relevant information to each actor in the safety management team. We propose a generic ontological model of safety expertise, based on Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (OSHA), that is employed as Knowledge required in our safety management methodology based on the MAPE-K (Monitor–Analyze–Plan–Execute and Knowledge) loop. We present the RAMIRES (Risk-Adaptive Management in Resilient Environments with Security) tool, implementing this methodology. RAMIRES is developed as a dashboard, supporting the safety management team in understanding the risk and its consequences, and to support decision making in risk treatment. RAMIRES interacts with the SWE and the safety management team (actors) in order to: (i) communicate the risks and preventive strategies to actors; (ii) obtain more data about the observed areas to understand the risk and its consequences; and (iii) execute the automatic preventive strategies and support actors in the execution of human-operated preventive strategies. In this paper, we show the details on concepts designed in the safety ontology and illustrate how these concepts can be extended to provide an abstract model of a specific use case. Furthermore, we propose the definition of constraints on the ontology using logic-based rules. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology regarding the resilience of the environment.",

Now days, to make the Social IoT (SIoT) a reality there are many on-going world-wide research initiatives and standardization efforts. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an extension to the concept of SIoT that proposes Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV). SIoV is an example of SIoT, where Smart vehicles are the objects of SIoT that builds social relationship and interchanges information to enhance the driving knowledge and gives various services to the drivers. In this paper, the proposed Vehicular Social Networks based on the VIoT consist of a large number of sensors that transmit data wirelessly. However, the very high heterogeneity in hardware capabilities of things and QoS requirements for different applications limits the performance of classical layered protocol solutions and the existing cross-layer solutions for wireless sensor networks. The results show that the proposed VSNP (Vehicular Social Network Protocol) for VIoT based on WSN solution can achieve a global communication optimum and outperforms existing layered solutions. The novel cross-layer module is a primary step towards providing efficient traffic management and reliable vehicle to vehicle communication in the SIoT. We have proposed an algorithm to control traffic congestion and road safety for VIoT.",

Their security, in a world where the Internet of Things has become a reality, is paramount to the continued safety of patients that are dependent upon these devices. The international standard ISO/IEC 80001 – Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices presents a unified and amalgamated approach to the safety of medical devices connected to IT networks. Whilst this standard presents a guide for security and risk management in health delivery organisations, its effectiveness with regard to contemporary cybersecurity is unknown. This research employed a structured review process to compare and analyse the ISO/IEC 80001 technical controls standards (ISO/IEC 80001-2-2 and ISO/IEC 80001-2-8), with contemporary cybersecurity best practice, guidelines and standards. The research deconstructed the technical controls and drew links between these standards and cybersecurity best practice to assess the level of harmonisation. Subsequently, a deeper analysis identified the areas of omission, coverage, addition or improvement that may impact the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 80001 to provide effective cybersecurity protection. ISO/IEC 80001 aims to provide a minimal level of cybersecurity however this research demonstrates that there are deficiencies in the standard and identifies the important aspects of cybersecurity that could be improved. This situation has arisen due to the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment and the protracted time to revise and republish international standards. This research identified several areas that require urgent consideration, including Emergency Access, Health Data De-Identification, Physical Locks on Devices, Data Backup, Disaster Recovery, Third-Party Components in Product Lifecycle Roadmap, Transmission Confidentiality, and Transmission Integrity. The research will provide health delivery organisations implementing ISO/IEC 80001, assurance as to the level of protection supplied by the ISO/IEC 80001 standard, and the areas that may need enhancement to increase cybersecurity protection and consequently increase in patient safety. Further, the outcomes are expected to influence development of the related international standard, as the findings from this research are being provided to the International Organisations for Standardisation, TC215 Health Informatics, Joint Working Group 7, to inform the review of ISO/IEC 80001 currently in progress.",

In particular, in-use vehicles are only required for inspection yearly, but huge amount of emissions may have been produced from malfunctioned engines daily. A new wireless inspection and notification system (WINS) is therefore proposed to monitor the vehicle engine health on the street in situ. The principle of WINS is to wirelessly examine some of the engine parameters through radio frequency identification (RFID) and traffic lights. RFID tags are installed on vehicles to collect the engine health information, whereas RFID interrogators are installed on traffic lights for wireless data transmission. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed WINS, and the results show that the proposed WINS is more convenient and economical than traditional vehicle inspection system. Moreover, as there are more than hundreds of traffic lights in the traffic network of a city, a maximum spanning tree (MAXST) algorithm is proposed to determine the suitable number of RFID devices required in the network so that the implementation cost, system loading and missing rate can be optimized. Different from the typical spanning tree algorithm in operational research, the MAXST algorithm has a domain-specific rule and weight calculation method for this application. To verify the methodology, simulations on the traffic networks of Shenzhen, New York and London were conducted. Results show that only 25–40% of traffic lights of the traffic networks are necessary for installation of RFID interrogators, with a rate of 2–7% that the vehicle owners may be able to escape the location of RFID interrogators.",

abstract = "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), enhanced communication protocols, distributed intelligence for smart objects, wireless radio frequency systems and several other technologies and communication solutions together enable the promising next generation Internet, called Internet-of-Things. This paper presents a congestion and interference aware energy efficient routing technique for WSN namely, Survivable Path Routing. This protocol is supposed to work in the networks with high traffic because multiple sources try to send their packets to a destination at the same time, which is a typical scenario in IoT applications for remote healthcare monitoring. For selecting the next hop node, the algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of three factors: signal to interference and noise ratio of the link, the survivability factor the path from the next hop node to the destination, and the congestion level at the next hop node. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol works better concerning the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and the remaining energy level of the nodes. The rate of packet drops is also observed to be lesser in the congested topology scenarios.",

abstract = "Fog Computing, a technology that takes advantage of both the paradigms of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, has a great advantage in reducing the communication cost. Since its introduction, fog computing has found a lot of applications, including, for instance, connected vehicles, wireless sensors, smart cities and etc. One prominent problem in fog computing is how fine-grained access control can be imposed. Functional encryption, a new cryptographic primitive, is known to support fine-grained access control. However, when it comes to some new threats in the fog computing scenario, such as side channel attacks, functional encryption cannot maintain its security. Therefore, we need new cryptographic primitives that not only provide a way to securely share data with a fine-grained access control but also are able to resist those new threats. In this paper, we consider how to construct functional encryption schemes (FEs) adaptively secure in continual memory leakage model (CML), which is one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master secret keys. Besides providing privacy and fine-grained access control in fog computing, our scheme can also guarantee security against side channel attacks. More concretely, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure leakage-resilient FEs (LR-FEs) in the CML model results from leakage-resilient pair encoding, which is an extension of pair encoding presented in the recent work of Attrapadung. In this way, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Moreover, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs, including FE for regular languages, attribute-based encryption (ABE) for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. Above all, leakage-resilient adaptively secure functional encryption schemes can equip fog computing with higher security and fine-grained access control.",

For privacy reasons and due to lack of trust in the LBS providers, k-anonymity and l-diversity techniques have been widely used to preserve privacy of users in distributed LBS architectures in Internet of Things (IoT). However, in reality, there are scenarios where the locations of users are identical or similar/near each other in IoT. In such scenarios the k locations selected by k-anonymity technique are the same and location privacy can be easily compromised or leaked. To address the issue of privacy preservation, in this paper, we introduce the location labels to distinguish locations of mobile users to sensitive and ordinary locations. We design a location-label based (LLB) algorithm for protecting location privacy of users while minimizing the response time for LBS requests. We also evaluate the performance and validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm through extensive simulations.",

This model is used to recommend medicine with side effects for different symptoms collected from heterogeneous IoT sensors. Two datasets are taken for the analysis of big-data. One dataset contains diseases with drug details and the second dataset contains medicines with side effects. Information between physician and patient are semantically annotated and transferred in a meaningful way. A Lightweight Model for Semantic annotation of Big-data using heterogeneous devices in IoT is proposed to provide annotations for big data.

Cyber-attacks on CMS are not just limited to attacks on its computing sphere. Cross-domain attacks over both the physical and the computing spheres become critical. A taxonomy has been developed to specify the nature of the attacks, particularly when they are cross-domain. The taxonomy can help security professionals identify and detect cross-domain attacks in CMS. The taxonomy has been constructed in four dimensions: attack vector, attack impact, attack target, and attack consequence. To illustrate how the taxonomy can be utilized in detecting cross-domain attacks on CMS, infill malicious attacks on 3D printing processes are used as an example.",

In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages – a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation – nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters – benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels – advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things – replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation.",

It consists of economically powered, wireless and implanted medical monitoring sensor nodes, which are designed to continually collect the medical information of the target patients. Multichannel is often used in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes and the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention. The health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink node (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health emergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for multichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to meet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links. As a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the scheduled lossy links. Besides, potential collisions in the schedules also incur considerable delay in delivering the sensing data. In this paper, we propose a novel deadline-driven Link quality Aware Channel Assignment scheme (LACA), where link quality, deadlines and collisions are jointly considered. LACA prioritizes links with urgent deadlines and heavy collisions. Besides, LACA allows the exploitation of the spare slots for retransmissions on lossy links, which can further reduce the retransmission delay. Extensive simulation experiments show that compared to the existing approaches, LACA can better utilize the wireless spectrum and achieve higher packet delivery ratio before the deadline.",

These computing elements are usually wireless, interconnected to share data and interact with each other, with the server part and also with cloud computing services. In such a heterogeneous environment, new applications arise to meet ever-increasing needs and these are an important challenge to the processing capabilities of devices. For example, automatic driving systems, manufacturing environments, smart city management, etc. To meet the requirements of said application contexts, the system can create computing processes to distribute the workload over the network and/or a cloud computing server. Multiple options arise in relation to what network nodes should support the execution of the processes. This paper focuses on this problem by introducing a distributed computational model to dynamically share these tasks among the computing nodes and considering the inherent variability of the context in these environments. Our novel approach promotes the integration of the computing resources, with externally supplied cloud services, to fulfill modern application requirements. A prototype implementation for the proposed model has been built and an application example has been designed to validate the proposal in a real working environment.",

This combination enables a wide range of new applications and opportunities – particularly in the biomedical domain – but it also entails a number of new challenges. One of many research challenges in functional and non-functional aspects is the addressing and naming of nodes in a nano network. Our study in this area not only includes traditional techniques driven from today’s IoT, but also new unconventional ideas, originating from molecular level communication. We come up with a summary of either theoretical, simulated or realized ideas to draw conclusions about implementations and performance potential, with a focus on medical in-body communication scenarios, before we present our concept, Function Centric Nano-Networking (FCNN). FCNN allows us to address groups of interchangeable nano machines in a network by using location information and functional capabilities of the machines. This concept does not rely on the durability and uniqueness of individual nodes. We are comparing the novel concept of FCNN with similar ones and highlight elementary differences between them as well advantages and disadvantages.",

The sensor is suitable for wireless applications, it consists of two stub resonators on kapton in order to provide a differential detection. The final aim of this work is to develop a low cost communicating sensor which can be integrated into real time multi sensing platform dedicated to the applications requiring low power consumption and adaptable for the Internet of Things (IoT), in order to do the detection of harmful gases such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Preliminary results have shown a large influence of ethanol concentration on the electrical properties of the passive resonators at radio-frequency range. These vapors have induced additional insertion losses and frequency shifts on the first resonant frequency mode around 0.65GHz. The sensor sensitivity to ethanol vapors exposition has been estimated to −642.9Hz/ppm and −7μdB/ppm for resonant frequency and insertion losses variations in differential mode, respectively, according to the values at 4min of exposure to 500, 1000 and 2000ppm. To deepen the study of the sensor, we have focused on the influence of ethanol on the conductivity of the sensitive layer, in terms of repeatability and sensitivity. We proposed a way of real-time reconstruction of the response by representing the difference of the insertion losses as well as the difference of frequencies calculated on the basis of the phase average value within a specified frequency range near the resonance. This lead to estimate a sensitivity of −9μdB/ppm and 648.1Hz/ppm, respectively, for ethanol concentrations ranging from 500ppm to 2000ppm at 10min of exposure.",

Organizations too often make a decision that will produce a positive consequence and then focus on how to implement it, rarely stepping back to ask “What else could happen?” Any decision changes the system in which it exists. The longer the time required to implement a decision, the more systemic changes can alter the effects of the decision on the system. Decisions to implement Corporate Social Responsibility and sustainability initiatives usually involve many different stakeholders and may involve systems in which organizations have little expertise or experience. A major negative unintended consequence, even for a CSR initiative, can damage the stakeholders’ trust in the organization.

The traditional model of the isolated device no longer applies, the future home will be connected with services provided by third parties ranging from supermarkets to domestic appliance manufacturers. In order to achieve this risk based integrated device management and contextualization is explored in this paper based on the cloud computing model. We produce an architecture and evaluate risk models to assist in this management of devices from a security, privacy and resource management perspective.

abstract = "Today, healthcare providers are experiencing explosive growth in data. Although the dramatic increase in the use of medical imaging technologies has been a major contributor to healthcare data growth in the past decade, more recently the rising adoption of sensing devices, enabling people to collect health-related data independently at any time or place is leading to a torrent of sensor data. The scale and richness of the sensor data currently being collected and analysed is rapidly growing. The key challenges that we will be facing are how to effectively manage and make use of this abundance of easily generated and diverse health data. This paper explores the potential for sensors use in healthcare data acquisition and presents the next evolution in the on-going development of Wiki-Health, a big data service platform, designed to address the larger problem of explosive growth in healthcare information by providing a unified solution for collecting, storing, tagging, retrieving, searching and analysing personal health sensor data. Additionally, the platform is designed to allow users to reuse and remix data, along with analysis results and analysis models, to make health-related knowledge discovery more available to individual users–including health professionals, patients or even individuals who desire to maintain an optimum level of personal health–on a massive scale. To tackle the challenge of efficiently managing the high volume and diversity of big data, Wiki-Health introduces a hybrid data storage model capable of storing structured, semi-structured and unstructured sensor data and sensor metadata separately. The design of such a hybrid model allows Wiki-Health to potentially handle heterogeneous formats of sensor data. In addition to its data management capabilities, we envision the potential for Wiki-Health as a system that also enables health sensor data monitoring and analysis, not only as a method of tracking existing health conditions but also as a means of encouraging a more pro-active approach to healthcare through early detection. To tackle the scalability and performance challenges of real-time analysis, the Analysis Tasks Allocation Scheme proposed in the research aids the management of data analysis tasks on a large scale and utilises the elastic nature of cloud infrastructure by considering the aspects of performance and cost. To evaluate the proposed Wiki-Health approach, we have developed an ECG-based health monitoring service on top of the Wiki-Health platform. The positive performance of the approach is supported by the results obtained in our experimental trials and shows significant potential for real-world applications.",

abstract = "Monitoring the compliance of the execution of multi-party business processes is a complex and challenging task: each actor only has the visibility of the portion of the process under its direct control, and the physical objects that belong to a party are often manipulated by other parties. Because of that, there is no guarantee that the process will be executed — and the objects be manipulated — as previously agreed by the parties. The problem is usually addressed through a centralized monitoring entity that collects information, sent by the involved parties, on when activities are executed and the artifacts are altered. This paper aims to tackle the problem in a different and innovative way: it proposes a decentralized solution based on the switch from control- to artifact-based monitoring, where the physical objects can monitor their own conditions and the activities in which they participate. To do so, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is exploited by equipping physical objects with sensing hardware and software, turning them into smart objects. To instruct these smart objects, an approach to translate classical Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process models into a set of artifact-centric process models, rendered in Extended-GSM (E-GSM) (our extension of the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) notation), is proposed. The paper presents the approach, based on model-based transformation, demonstrates its soundness and correctness, and introduces a prototype monitoring platform to assess and experiment the proposed solution. A simple case study in the domain of advanced logistics is used throughout the paper to exemplify the different parts of the proposal.",

For example, the world witnesses 15 million stroke patients each year. These individuals face a number of gait abnormalities including drop foot that is a pathological condition, limiting patients’ ability to lift the foot from the ground during the swing phase of walking. In this research work, we introduce a novel smart textile system, MagicSox that is woven with multiple sensors distributed over the surface of the foot. The overarching goal of MagicSox is to quantify the gait abnormalities in remote settings such as patients’ homes so that clinicians and physical therapists can assess their patients on daily basis. The paper provides a detailed architecture of MagicSox that leverages the computing and communication capabilities of a modern internet of things (IoT) processor, Intel Curie. We have developed an Android smartphone app that uses Bluetooth low energy and automates the multi-sensor data collection from MagicSox. In the algorithmic front, we adopted multiplication of backward differences (MOBD) to analyze the multi-modal time series data to distinguish drop foot events from normal walking cycles. We pursued a usability study on healthy participants who were asked to walk normally and also to simulate drop foot cycles. We developed support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to analyze the data. The classification resulted in the accuracy of drop foot detection varying from 71.78%−98.38%. The promising results now encourage us to evaluate MagicSox on stroke patients in future studies.",

Cloud, being the crucial component of IoT, provides valuable application specific services in many application domains. A number of IoT cloud providers are currently emerging into the market to leverage suitable and specific IoT based services. In spite of huge possible involvement of these IoT clouds, no standard cum comparative analytical study has been found across the literature databases. This article surveys popular IoT cloud platforms in light of solving several service domains such as application development, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization, and research. A comparison is presented for overall dissemination of IoT clouds according to their applicability. Further, few challenges are also described that the researchers should take on in near future. Ultimately, the goal of this article is to provide detailed knowledge about the existing IoT cloud service providers and their pros and cons in concrete form.",

This trend allows data collected from machines in operation to interact with cyberspace computers through a communication network, thus forming the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Besides, rapid advances in information and communications technologies provide approaches for analysing data, in an increasingly rapid, autonomously, ubiquitous and in real time way, providing information that assists humans in making better decisions. In this sense, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of machines, is indicated as a promising application of Smart Manufacturing in the CPS context, demanding the standardization of concepts, terms, and a formal implementation of data collection and treatment. For this purpose, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology is used in this paper, encompassing international standards, the unified 5-level architecture, ontology, and dependability for failure analysis in mechanical components. In addition, the creation of an ontology using the OWL 2 language was guided by the ‘Ontology Development 101′ approach. A pilot test was carried out using a centrifugal pump to demonstrate the applicability of the ontology. Thus, the ontology is evaluated in Protégé, which allow queries with SPARQL language to provide future decision-making for condition-based maintenance in real processes.",

Similarly, Amazon understands user preference and recommends items of interest to shop and so on. In this paper, we survey context aware computing systems from a Big data perspective. We first propose a taxonomy of existing work on the basis of sensing platforms and then discuss the latest developments in this field of Big data context aware systems focusing on how such systems deal with various Big data challenges.

abstract = "While the use of health informatics is increasing in health care, how it is improving health care and how users accept the services has been little studied, and due to increasing uncertainty, credibility has become a key determinant of health informatics adoption and diffusion. However, little is known about the underlying nature of user trust or how early-stage credibility influences later-stage behavior and experience. To enhance the explanatory power and make it more applicable to health consumers' behavioral intentions, expectation-confirmation theory was extended by adding antecedents and moderating variables from the theory of planned behavior. With health informatics services in place, this study investigates how credibility influence other user perceptions such as perceived utility and how these perceptions together determine user intentions and behaviors concerning health informatics at both the initial and later stages of use. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of these attitudes and behaviors was carried out, and the results showed that perceived utility and credibility are critical at both the initial and later stages in user acceptance of health informatics services. Users' actual experiences modify their perceptions of utility and influence the confirmation of their initial expectations. These results have implications for the fundamental nature of credibility and perceived utility as well as their roles in the long-term sustainability of future health informatics services.",

This work investigates a data processing approach for material-integrated and mobile ubiquitous SHM and SLM systems by using self-organizing mobile multi-agent systems (MAS), executed on a highly portable JavaScript-based Agent Processing Platform (APP), and optimized Machine Learning (ML) methods providing load class recognition from a set of sensors embedded in the technical structure. Machine learning approaches usually require a large amount of computational power and storage resources and ML is commonly performed off-line, not suitable for resource constrained sensor network implementations. Instead, a novel distributed-regional on-line learning is applied, with on-line distributed sensor processing and learning performed by the agent system. The APP provides ML as a service, and the agent itself only collects training and analysis data passed to the APP, finally returning a learned model that is saved by the agent in a compact format (and is available on any other location). A case study shows that the learning algorithm is suitable (stable) for noisy and time varying sensor data. Spatial global learning is reduced and mapped on local region learning with global voting.",

A smart city operates using large numbers of networked sensors to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in near-real time; these data may also have secondary applications. This study proposes one such use of the data gathered by home energy management systems (HEMS). Current HEMS focus mainly on energy efficiency, but residents typically value indoor comfort as well. HEMS collect various types of data that can be used to create an index for short-term indoor comfort called the predicted mean vote (PMV). This study implements a system to identify information within the stored data that is relevant to reducing electricity consumption while maintaining indoor comfort according to each resident’s PMV preference. The system was tested in three households in Japan for 12 days in winter. The system reduced electricity consumption by 5.15% and increased the comfort satisfaction expressed as PMV by 42.3%. Qualitative assessments of indoor comfort increased by 16.4%. Providing users with information selected according to their PMV preferences was more effective in reducing electricity consumption and increasing indoor comfort than providing them with random information.",

Much work has been done to develop this device and improve its performance. However, no systematic report about its applications through large-scale publication and patent data analysis is available. In this study, we use “Tech Mining,” a systematic analytical method based on structured texts applied to publication and patent abstract data, to analyze potential applications of TENGs. A series of applications from product scale to industry scale are identified. The findings show that when used as sensors, TENGs are mostly applicable in automation and energy-intensive industries such as automotive, medical or surgical devices, consumer electronics and household appliances. TENGs in the form of sensors can also be integrated with future-oriented and exponentially growing technologies such as robotics, drones, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics that will create enormous value for future economies. Moreover, applications of TENGs as sensors are also in line with current global trends of science and technology development, including the “Internet of Things,” big data, clean energy, and smart cities. Combined with those technologies and industries, TENGs can help in tackling challenges of global warming, environmental pollution and security systems. We suggest the TENG research community to widen interdisciplinary collaboration, pursue connections with industry, and file more patents as R&D progresses. In addition, research limitations and future development directions of TENG are pointed out.",

With the development of IoT, more and more IoT devices are equipped with multiple radio interfaces, such as both Wi-Fi and ZigBee. Inspired by this, we propose a cross-interface power saving management (CPSM) scheme, which leverages the existing low-power ZigBee interfaces to wake up the high-power Wi-Fi interfaces on demand towards enabling multi-hop communications in IoT. The objective is to minimize the network energy consumption while satisfying certain end-to-end delay requirements. The results of extensive simulations and prototype-based experiments have demonstrated that the energy consumption of our proposed CPSM is 79.2% and 68.9% lower than those of the IEEE 802.11’s standard power saving scheme and a state-of-the-art scheme in moderate traffic scenarios, respectively.",

Time-or interval-based maintenance (TBM) accounts for almost 100%, while, On-condition maintenance and other proactive maintenance are seldom adopted. TBM not only can't prevent happens of equipment fault but also cause the waste of the maintenance resource. In order to allocate maintenance resources reasonably, ascertain the minimum preventive maintenance requirement, ensure the reliability, availability and safety, this paper carries out a research on Risk and Condition Based Maintenance (RCBM) task optimization technology. Utilizing the internet of things (IOT), real-time database, signal-processing, Gray Neural Network, probability statistical analysis and service oriented architecture (SOA) technology, a Risk and Condition Based Indicator Decision-making System (RCBIDS) is built. RCBIDS integrates RCM, condition monitoring system (CMS), key performance management module, file management module, fault and defect management module, maintenance management module together, which aims to realize remote condition monitoring, maintenance technical support services (TSS), quantitative maintenance decision-making, and to ensure the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS). The Predictive Maintenance Indicator model, reliability prediction model and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) model, which are embedded in the RCBIDS, are constructed separately. An engineering case shows that the risk and condition based maintenance task optimization technology can be used to optimize maintenance content and maintenance period, to minimize maintenance deficiencies and maintenance surplus, and to prolong the lifespan of equipment.",

The term Industry 4.0 initiates from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government. Such project advocates the computerization of the manufacturing industry. It is also known as the 4th industrial revolution. Precisely speaking, industry 4.0 is based on the technological concepts of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT), which enables the Factory of the Future (FoF). Within the modular structured smart factories of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the IoT, Cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real time. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are considered the backbone for the Industry 4.0. Thus, this paper attempts to answer the research question: “Are today's ERP systems ready for the FoF?”.

This content “name” is used to retrieve any information, unlike in device-centric networks (i.e., the current Internet), which depend on physical IP addresses. Meanwhile, the smart home concept has been gaining attention in academia and industries; various low-cost embedded devices are considered that can sense, process, store, and communicate data autonomously. In this paper, we study NDN in the context of smart-home communications, discuss the preliminary evaluations, and describe the future challenges of applying NDN in smart-home applications.",

Prediction of symptomatic crises in chronic diseases in the IoT scenario leads to the deployment of ambulatory monitoring systems. These systems place a major concern in the amount of data to be processed and the intelligent management of the energy consumption. The huge amount of data generated for these systems require high computing capabilities only available in Data Centers. This paper presents a real case of prediction in the eHealth scenario, devoted to neurological disorders. The presented case study focuses on the migraine headache, a disease that affects around 15% of the European population. This paper extrapolates results from real data and simulations in a study where migraine patients are monitored using an unobtrusive Wireless Body Sensor Network. Low-power techniques are applied in monitorization nodes. Techniques such us: on-node signal processing and radio policies to make node’s autonomy longer and save energy, have been applied. Workload balancing policies are carried out in the coordinator nodes and Data Centers to reduce the computational burden in these facilities and minimize its energy consumption. Our results draw average savings of € 288 million in this eHealth scenario applied only to 2% of European migraine sufferers; in addition to savings of € 1272 million due to the benefits of the migraine prediction.",

In order to develop a predictive model for health-shocks, we have collected a unique data from 1000 households, in rural and remotely accessible regions of Pakistan, focusing on factors like health, social, economic, environment and accessibility to healthcare facilities. We have used the collected data to generate a predictive model of health-shock using a fuzzy rule summarization technique, which can provide stakeholders with interpretable linguistic rules to explain the causal factors affecting health-shocks. The evaluation of the proposed system in terms of the interpret-ability and accuracy of the generated data models for classifying health-shock shows promising results. The prediction accuracy of the fuzzy model based on a k-fold cross-validation of the data samples shows above 89% performance in predicting health-shocks based on the given factors.",

On the other hand, the design of new channel models, able to capture the inherent features of the phenomena related with this specific field is of paramount importance. Very high molecular absorption, and very high reflection loss are peculiarities phenomena that need to be included in these models. In this paper, we present a full-wave propagation model of the electromagnetic field that propagates in the THz band both for Line-of-Sight and Non-Line-of-Sight propagation models.

Frequent patterns can identify channels or infrastructures to be strengthened and can help in choosing the most suitable message routing schema or network protocol. In general, frequent patterns have been called motifs and overrepresented motifs have been recognized to be the low-level building blocks of networks and to be useful to explain many of their properties, playing a relevant role in determining their dynamic and evolution. In this paper triadic motifs are found first partitioning a network by strength of connections and then analyzing the partitions separately. The case study is the World Trade Web (WTW), that is the directed graph connecting world Countries with trade relationships, with the aim of finding its topological characterization in terms of motifs and isolating the key factors underlying its evolution. The WTW has been split based on the weights of the graph to highlight structural differences between the big players in terms of volumes of trade and the rest of the world.

On a similar note, “smart city” is a futuristic approach to alleviate obstacles triggered by ever-increasing population and fast urbanization which is going to benefit the governments as well as the masses. Modern day cities are deprived of vital elements like quality of life and socio-economic development which can be delivered by the smart cities. Smart cities are an endeavour to make cities more efficient, sustainable and liveable. In other words, a smart city is a city that can monitor and integrate functionality of all the critical infrastructure like roads, tunnels, airways, waterways, railways, communication power supply, etc., control maintenance activities and can help in optimizing the resources while keeping an eye on the security issues as well. This research paper explores various aspects and dimensions of a smart city. To bridge the gap in literature regarding the concept of smart cities and its implementation, a framework has been developed to get better insights about the idea of smart city. On the basis of extensive and deep research of literature from diverse domains, we have identified six significant pillars for developing the framework as: Social, Management, Economic, Legal, Technology and Sustainability (SMELTS). The paper throws light upon how these factors can make the smart city initiative a successful project. The proposed framework has been used to figure out various agendas for research and traces its practical implications.",

Despite operating in a relatively mature industry, companies in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software segment are still influenced by revenue driven valuations. The nature of the industry, with low delivery costs and high personnel costs, and the on-going switch from packaged software revenues towards “as a service” revenues protect the importance of revenues in this segment. With the development of the sector, the valuation drivers (key operating performance indicators) shift from revenue growth to profitability. In the ERP software segment top line growth remains the key driver especially with emergence of the Internet of Things and the concept of “Industry 4.0”, where an increasing number of devices are interconnected and can communicate with each other. The article analyses through regression analysis the current revenue and operating profitability based valuation levels of thirteen publicly listed in the ERM software segments against several key operating performance indicators. The results of our research show that future expected revenue growth remains the most important key operating performance indicator and both revenue and profitability driven valuations remain relevant.

Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO2, O2, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives.",

This novel view has opened the Web services to a variety of devices especially to tiny and resource-constrained devices. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks belong to that kind of devices. Those networks have become one of the more promising technologies to take part in the Future Internet. However, the integration of Sensor and Actuator Networks into the Service Cloud is a hard challenge requiring specific new architectures and protocols. This paper presents a middleware approach addressing this important issue. A Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented Middleware (KASOM) for pervasive embedded networks is proposed. The major aim of KASOM is to offer advanced and enriched pervasive services to everyone connected to Internet. In this sense, KASOM implements mechanisms and protocols which allow managing the knowledge generated in pervasive embedded networks in order to expose it to Internet users in a readable way. General functional requirements of embedded sensor and actuator platforms have been taken into account when designing KASOM, with special attention in energy consumption, memory and bandwidth. The KASOM evaluation and validation will be demonstrated through a real Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network deployment based on integral healthcare services in a sanatorium.",

abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

Globally, a number of sensors being produced for animal health management are at various stages of commercialization. Some technologies for producing an accurate health status and disease diagnosis are applicable only for humans, with few modifications or testing in animal models. Now, these innovative technologies are being considered for their future use in livestock development and welfare. Precision livestock farming techniques, which include a wide span of technologies, are being applied, along with advanced technologies like microfluidics, sound analyzers, image-detection techniques, sweat and salivary sensing, serodiagnosis, and others. However, there is a need to integrate all the available sensors and create an efficient online monitoring system so that animal health status can be monitored in real time, without delay. This review paper discusses the scope of different wearable technologies for animals, nano biosensors and advanced molecular biology diagnostic techniques for the detection of various infectious diseases of cattle, along with the efforts to enlist and compare these technologies with respect to their drawbacks and advantages in the domain of animal health management. The paper considers all recent developments in the field of biosensors and their applications for animal health to provide insight regarding the appropriate approach to be used in the future of enhanced animal welfare.",

In this paper, Knowle—an online news management system upon semantic link network model is introduced. Knowle is a news event centrality data management system. The core elements of Knowle are news events on the Web, which are linked by their semantic relations. Knowle is a hierarchical data system, which has three different layers including the bottom layer (concepts), the middle layer (resources), and the top layer (events). The basic blocks of the Knowle system—news collection, resources representation, semantic relations mining, semantic linking news events are given. Knowle does not require data providers to follow semantic standards such as RDF or OWL, which is a semantics-rich self-organized network. It reflects various semantic relations of concepts, news, and events. Moreover, in the case study, Knowle is used for organizing and mining health news, which shows the potential on forming the basis of designing and developing big data analytics based innovation framework in the health domain.",

Existing review articles generally utilise medical literature and categories: none investigates M-health from an information systems (IS) design point of view. Identifying application areas, design issues and IS research techniques will demonstrate models, issues, approaches and gaps to inform future research. A comprehensive analysis of the literature from this viewpoint is thus valuable, both for theoretical progression and for guiding real-world innovative system developments. Drawing from key IS and healthcare multidisciplinary journals we analyse recent (2010–2016) articles concerning M-health application developments and their associated design or development issues, with particular focus on the use of contemporary research methods. Our analysis suggests that M-health is an emerging field to which, although underused, contemporary approaches such as design science research are particularly appropriate. We identify eight application categories, eleven design issues (security, privacy, literacy, accessibility, acceptability, reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, knowledge sharing and flexibility) as well as the stakeholders and development techniques involved. This goes beyond previous frameworks, and theoretically integrates the central role of IS design within the sub-field.",

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.",

Because of the resource constraints of the nodes in such networks, the traditional cryptographic primitives are not suitable solutions. Our endeavor in this paper is to develop a new deterministic key distribution mechanism for such networks. In particular, we bring in a novel construction methodology from two-dimensional geometry by exploiting the properties of regular Hexagon. One advantage of using the proposed approach, as opposed to randomized distribution techniques, is that, the configurations have a compact and efficient algebraic description. This yields nice algorithm for shared-key discovery, in which very little information (or no information at all) needs to be broadcasted. Furthermore, it is shown that the security strength of the proposed approach outperforms well-known deterministic techniques in terms of resilience. Furthermore, the distribution technique ensures 100% connectivity (i.e., the probability that two nodes share a key is 1) and average key-path length is 1.",

DTNs have been studied in-depth by many researchers and multiple high quality survey papers have been produced which analyzes DTN features, taxonomies, and applications. In recent years, interest in DTN research has rekindled as there are several emerging network-based application domains that require delay tolerance support and thus can use DTN specific routing and data dissemination techniques. Examples of such novel areas are Information Centric Network (ICN), Mobile ICN, Named Data Network (NDN), Internet of Things (IoT), etc. In this paper, we have surveyed those applications briefly and have proposed an alternate taxonomy for classifying existing DTN routing algorithms. The objective of this survey is to help future researchers to identify DTN specific properties in the new applications and to apply appropriate routing protocols whenever necessary. We have studied the relation between message replication and individual or group communication semantics of DTN routing protocols considering both social-based and opportunistic message forwarding techniques. We have also introduced an in-depth coverage of data dissemination protocols in DTN which can be adapted to content-centric networking domains. We conclude our survey by identifying a set of open challenges for future researchers.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things is as much a promise for our future as it is a challenge to our energy provisioning infrastructure. Energy harvesting is an important opportunity to address this challenge, and it may lead to a sustainable Internet of Things with low operation cost and maintenance cost. We study the design space of secure authentication using harvested energy. Secure authentication ensures that one can remotely verify the identity of a Thing, which is a critical step in the absence of a human user-in-the-loop. We assume an operating environment of a wireless node that is authenticated by the host; the wireless node contains an RF frontend, a micro-controller, and energy harvesting unit. The design space of energy-harvested secure authentication is rich and spans the protocol level, the algorithm level, and the (hardware) architecture level. Design decisions at each abstraction level affect the energy efficiency of the resulting solution, and the demands toward the energy-harvesting process. The key objective of this paper is to chart this design space from the energy versus performance point-of-view, and for a standard set of authentication protocols. To validate our analysis, we created a hardware prototype including a solar-based energy harvester, an MSP-430 micro-controller and a 2.4GHz radio link. We have accurately measured the energy consumption of the different components for different authentication algorithms, and at different levels of optimization. Our results show a trade-off over many orders of magnitude in energy and performance. However, the optimization knobs are distributed over every abstraction level. Our contribution therefore provides a comprehensive view at the overall energy optimization problem.",

abstract = "In this paper, a secure and efficient authentication and authorization architecture for IoT-based healthcare is developed. Security and privacy of patients’ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based DTLS handshake protocol as it is the main IP security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a TI SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The CC2538 module integrated into the TI board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.",

Thus, there is a need for sophisticated fine-grained access control mechanisms to cater these access demands and thereby experience the full potential of e-health systems. In order to realize a flexible access control scheme, integrating access delegation is of paramount importance. However, access delegation has to be enforced in a controlled manner so that it will not jeopardize the security of the system. In this paper, we addressed this issue through proposing an attribute based access control scheme integrated with controlled access delegation capabilities. We demonstrate how the proposed scheme could function by considering a health information sharing scenario which constitutes a collaborative environment. The proposed scheme capable of provisioning multi-level access delegation with each delegating user having the capability of controlling further delegations by the delegatee. In addition, the scheme is also integrated with a mechanism to limit the total number of delegations allowable for a given attribute to accommodate for inappropriate user behaviors. Thus, users can claim access to resources by providing a proof that they possess attribute sets (attributes may or may not be delegated) that satisfy the relevant attribute based access policies which govern the access to the shared resources. The proposed scheme is also equipped with on-demand attribute revocation mechanism along with preventing attacks via attribute collusion. Furthermore, we have shown that the proposed access control scheme is secure and also exhibits superior delegation capabilities compared to the existing attribute based schemes coupled with access delegation capabilities.",

abstract = "Current global food supply chains are faced with an ever increasing variety of modern day societal challenges. As a direct result of these challenges many of these supply chains are operating in a “below ideal” state, resulting in approximately one third of the food produced for human consumption being wasted across the globe. A key contributory factor to such high waste is an inability to control/monitor temperature across global food supply networks. This is an issue that needs to be addressed both nationally and internationally to meet the complex challenges surrounding modern day food security, safety and integrity. There is no one single “one solution fits all” approach when it comes to addressing cold chain inefficiencies. Latest cold chain technologies, their respective advantages and disadvantages, applied to the industry are presented in the present work. Technological solutions including Radio Frequency (RF) technologies and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are discussed within this manuscript. Their key success metric is their strategic complementarity, give the fact WSN lacks robustness and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) lacks reading range and possess limited sensing systems. Other solutions discussed include temperature estimation methods for reducing the numbers of sensors deployed, when comparing them, Neural Networks showed better approximations than Kriging and Capacitor methods given the non-linear relationship between the temperature target and the temperature source. Computational Fluid Dynamics is also presented as a commercial method to correct inefficiencies at pre-cooling stages. Thermal imaging (thermal infra-red camera) have proven to be a good temperature source for the Neural Network in temperature estimation. This article also focuses on and emphasizes the importance of a technological Internet-of-Things approach, given the fact it is key in facilitating the information exchange between items in the cold chain, RF technologies and WSN can interconnect the data and those items, and make them accessible in databases associating hardware and software. There are a number of challenges to consider when adopting any/all of the systems outlined in this manuscript. It is important to highlight however, as with all solutions there exists no single “out of the box” solution due to the fact that the composition of product, transport route, method of transport and process efficiency varies greatly across products around the globe. Each technology, in isolation, is limited in its impact and challenged in both functional capabilities and performance, however when adopted in combination these technologies offer significant value add improvement in supply chain management.",

Nanogenerators were first developed for self-powered systems based on piezoelectric effect and triboelectrification effect for converting tiny mechanical energy into electricity, which have applications in internet of things, environmental/infrastructural monitoring, medical science and security. In this paper, we present the fundamental theory of the nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations. In the Maxwell's displacement current, the first term ε0∂E∂t gives the birth of electromagnetic wave, which is the foundation of wireless communication, radar and later the information technology. Our study indicates that the second term ∂P∂t in the Maxwell's displacement current is directly related to the output electric current of the nanogenerator, meaning that our nanogenerators are the applications of Maxwell's displacement current in energy and sensors. By contrast, electromagnetic generators are built based on Lorentz force driven flow of free electrons in a conductor. This study presents the similarity and differences between pieozoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, as well as the classical electromagnetic generator, so that the impact and uniqueness of the nanogenerators can be clearly understood. We also present the three major applications of nanogenerators as micro/nano-power source, self-powered sensors and blue energy.",

Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision). The survey also covers data fusion in the domains of emotion recognition and general-health and introduce relevant directions and challenges of future research on multi-sensor fusion in the BSN domain.",

abstract = "Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.",

abstract = "From an Internet of Things aware business processes perspective, quality of information of physical resources as well as access cost information provide important criteria to differentiate resource providers and to choose the one that meets process requirements. Despite business process languages, such as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN2.0) do not foresee quality of information aspects, recent works extend the BPMN2.0 to include them. This way, the definition of process models can include quality requirements and process execution can be adapted considering these criteria. In this paper we take a step forward by bringing access cost information (e.g. energy consumption) to the business process level. Quality of information cannot be assessed alone due to its interdependency with access cost (e.g. increasing sensor sampling rate will improve not only information quality but also energy consumption). Therefore, quality of information and access cost can be used in process definitions, as well as to optimize and adapt process execution. Additionally, changing quality and cost requirements can also influence physical resources behavior at runtime as, for instance, in dealing with unexpected exceptions. Hence, processes can control and make tradeoffs regarding quality of information and access cost.",

abstract = "With the widespread popularity of big data usage across various applications, need for efficient storage, processing, and retrieval of massive datasets generated from different applications has become inevitable. Further, handling of these datasets has become one of the biggest challenges for the research community due to the involved heterogeneity in their formats. This can be attributed to their diverse sources of generation ranging from sensors to on-line transactions data and social media access. In this direction, probabilistic data structures (PDS) are suitable for large-scale data processing, approximate predictions, fast retrieval and unstructured data storage. In conventional databases, entire data needs to be stored in memory for efficient processing, but applications involving real time in-stream data demand time-bound query output in a single pass. Hence, this paper proposes Accommodative Bloom filter (ABF), a variant of scalable bloom filter, where insertion of bulk data is done using the addition of new filters vertically. Array of m bits is divided into b buckets of l bits each and new filters of size ‘m∕k′ are added to each bucket to accommodate the incoming data. Data generated from various sensors has been considered for experimental purposes where query processing is done at two levels to improve the accuracy and reduce the search time. It has been found that insertion and search time complexity of ABF does not increase with increase in number of elements. Further, results indicate that ABF outperforms the existing variants of Bloom filters in terms of false positive rates and query complexity, especially when dealing with in-stream data.",

In this context, Privacy-Preserving Tabular Data Publishing (PPTDP) has drawn considerable attention, where different approaches have been proposed to preserve the privacy of individuals' tabular data. Such data can include Single Sensitive Attributes (SSA) or Multiple Sensitive Attributes (MSA) or come from data streams. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to analyze and evaluate the main different data anonymization approaches that have been introduced in PPTDP. The study investigates the three broad areas of research: SSA, MSA and data streams.

abstract = "Security for the Internet of Things (IoT) presents the challenge of offering suitable security primitives to enable IP-based security protocols such as IPSec and DTLS. This challenge is here because host-based implementations and solutions are not providing a proper performance over the devices used in the IoT. This is mainly because of the use of highly constraint devices in terms of computational capabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to implement new optimized and scalable cryptographic primitives which can use existing protocols to provide security, authentication, privacy and integrity to the communications. Our research focus on the mathematical optimization of cryptographic primitives for Public Key Cryptography (PKC) based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). PKC has been considered, since the IoT requires high scalability, multi-domain interoperability, self-commissioning, and self-identification. Specifically, this contribution presents a set of optimizations for ECC over constrained devices, and a brief tutorial of its implementation in the microprocessor Texas Instrument MSP430 (Briel, 2000)  [1] (commonly used in IoT devices such as 6LoWPAN, active RFID and DASH7). Our main contribution is the proof that these special pseudo-Mersenne primes, which we have denominated ‘shifting primes’ can be used for ECC primitives with 160-bit keys in a highly optimal way. This paper presents an ECC scalar multiplication with 160-bit keys within 5.4 million clock cycles over MSP430 devices without hardware multiplier. Shifting primes provide a set of features, which make them more compliant with the set of instructions available with tiny CPUs such as the MSP430 and other 8 and 16-bit CPUs.",

In the case of smartphone apps for fitness tracking, results of this data can be used similar to the growing application of global positioning systems for automotive travel surveying. The authors evaluate data from Travis County, Texas for the purpose of determining where bicyclists ride, primarily for fitness purposes. Ride trip volumes are evaluated with residential and employment density, land use diversity, bicycle facilities and terrain to characterize places chosen for bicycling for health. Though limited to bicycle rides and routes voluntarily logged using the smartphone app, this method provides promise for applications in multi-modal transportation planning and health impact assessment studies.",

This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.",

Primarily of concern is how to ensure anonymity and privacy within these methodologies, and further the related issue of how to incentivize participants and remove barriers/concerns over participation. To address these concerns, in this paper we introduce a novel system to capture aggregate population health research data via utilizing smartphone capabilities while fully maintaining the anonymity and privacy of each individual contributing such data. A key and novel capability of this system is the support for customizable data collection; without the need to know specific details about an individual. The customized collection rules can be deployed on the local device based on detailed local data, and the resultant collection can be measured by the anonymous data collection network. In this paper we provide a conceptual architecture and describe a method for local processing of aggregate e-Research health data utilizing adaptive privacy thresholds to create a multi-party flexible approach to participatory data submission to support this novel health e-Research capability.",

The applications span large domains including mobile digital health, structural and environmental monitoring, smart home, energy efficient buildings, agriculture, smart cities, etc. WSN are also an important contributor to the fast emerging Internet of Things infrastructure. Some of the design specifications for WSN include reliability, accuracy, cost, deployment versatility, power consumption, etc. Power consumption is (most often) the dominant constraint in designing such systems. This constraint has multi-dimensional implications such as battery type and size, energy harvester design, lifetime of the deployment, intelligent sensing capability, etc. Power optimization techniques have to explore a large design search space. Energy neutral system implementation is the ultimate goal in wireless sensor networks ensuring a perpetual/greener use and represents a hot topic of research. Several recent advances promise significant reduction of the overall sensor network power consumption. These advances include novel sensors and sensor interfaces, low energy wireless transceivers, low power processing, efficient energy harvesters, etc. This paper reviews a number of system level power management methodologies for Wireless Sensor Networks. Especially, the paper is focusing on the promising technology of nano-Watt wake-up radio receiver and its combination with mature power management techniques to achieve better performance.

The way that is eminently to accomplish concurrency is to build an object-oriented environment with support for messages passing between concurrent objects.

The experiments results show that server-side JavaScript with Node.js and MongoDB as database is 40% faster than Apache Sling.

abstract = "The surge of interest in digital building models combined with increasing sensorization of spaces is prompting an integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) with real-time sensor data. However, current approaches reported in literature either remain theoretical or target very specific application domains, showing that there is no generic approach to assist in the creation of service and application software that combines sensor data with BIM models. The solution presented in this article addresses the engineering complexity associated with integrating sensor data with BIM by leveraging an advanced software engineering technique known as a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). We demonstrate also that the language herein proposed, named Building Information Modeling Sensor Language(BIMSL) provides substantial gains of expressiveness and ease of use in developing queries that process sensor data with complex conditions over BIM models. BIMSL is validated with experienced software developers according to a consistent evaluation protocol for DSLs focused on effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and usability attributes. The results outperform the standard existing alternatives, indicating that our proposal contributes to reducing the human effort associated with integrating BIM with sensor data.",

abstract = "‘The Digital Citizen’ has become a buzzword in recent years as part of the social and economic agendas of many countries and as a key theme in the strategy for Europe 2020. In 2014, the Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, described its emergence as “people with greater access to information, people empowered to shape the world around them. More able to both learn: and participate”.1 Yet, while the benefits of this vision are clear, harnessing the opportunities on offer requires confronting significant challenges. In seeking to explore what this empowering concept means for law and policy-makers today, this Seminar is intended to encourage reflection upon how increasing digitisation and hyper-connectivity affects our day-to-day interactions with those in power, as well as the security and privacy issues arising from them. For example, in many countries the development of new forms of digital identity management enables citizens to assert their identity electronically in order to access public services (such as online access to their medical data). However, these can only work optimally when supported by citizen-centric policy and legal frameworks that are technology-neutral, trust enhancing and mutually recognised across borders. New data-driven and virtual relationships with governments also necessitate a reconsideration of the rights that digital citizen deserve. On the one hand, the ease with which increasing amounts of accessible personal data can be collected – overtly or covertly – and analysed by states about their citizens' raises concerns about lost privacy controls and substantial power imbalances (such as regarding storage and access rights to such data). On the other hand, massive improvements in accessing information permit opportunities for greater engagement with government by individuals, yet assume the rollout of better and faster internet connectivity for all citizens to participate. In turn, social media has demonstrated how ICT can facilitate collective citizen activism to pressure for societal change, alongside the power of sousveillance to act as a countervailing force to pervasive state monitoring. Also ripe for discussion is the notion of reciprocal responsibilities between citizens and governments. In the physical space, for example, concerns are mounting over the implications of the advent of cheap wearable computers and drones. In the virtual domain, the borderless nature of the online world and its distributed control has connotations for a wider concept of networked citizenship with attendant rights. This led the creator of the Web – Sir Tim Berners-Lee – to call for a Bill of Rights (a ‘Magna Carta for the Web’) in 2014, the Web's 25th birthday, to protect its users. Citizen rights that already exist relevant to the online environment are scattered across various laws and are not always easy to understand. The roles of transnational institutions in fostering closer international cooperation on ICT policy, as well as strengthening confidence in privacy, consumer and data protection rights online, are also topics for discussion in this respect. Questions for discussion include: What does digital citizenship mean today? What rights, obligations and responsibilities should be associated with digital citizenship? What types of legal solutions are fit for purpose to protect digital citizenship interests? What should be the role of public sectors in e-identity assurance schemes, such as regarding liability? Should e-identity management be regulated? How does digital citizenship relate to novel rights, such as a right to public-sector data and a right to be forgotten online, and how might these rights be enforced effectively? To what extent can law and policy support increase transparency and trust by citizens in the actions of their governments? How can privacy and security be guaranteed to citizens where automated technologies affect their rights and civil liberties? How are biometrics and location-tracking devices used by states in body surveillance changing the digital citizenship landscape? How can individuals be more empowered to control their personal data held by governments and give informed consent to its use? What are the global drivers of digital citizenship policies and international cooperation in rule making and standard setting, especially in relation to emerging sensor-embedded technologies that will change the lives of citizens dramatically in the future?",

Although the discovery process of traditional Bluetooth architecture has been intensively investigated through analytical and simulation models over the years, it cannot be applied to the BLE technology because of many changes introduced in the design of the BLE. Recently, there have been several works for performance evaluation of BLE discovery process, but they are not still thorough enough in providing a holistic analysis of the BLE. This has motivated our study for more accurate modeling of the BLE discovery process. Our work focuses on developing an analytical model and carrying out intensive simulations to investigate discovery probability and quantitative examination of the influence of parameter settings on the discovery latency and the energy performance metric of the discovery process.",

In this article, a cooperative medium access control (MAC) framework is proposed for improving the performance and energy efficiency of WSNs, while satisfying a given reliability constraint. The energy-reliability trade off is achieved through a relay selection and power assignment algorithm, which is implemented within the COMAC cooperative MAC protocol that enables the coordination of candidate relays, calculation of the decision metrics, selection and actuation of the relay nodes with optimal power levels for cooperation. The proposed cross-layer MAC framework is evaluated in terms of energy costs as well as network performance metrics, in terms of throughput, delay and overhead. It is shown that the network throughput can be improved significantly, while the energy consumption is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude as compared to standard Zigbee WSNs, at negligibly small overhead and computational costs.",

With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, flexible sensors are regarded as one of the most important technologies for the development of human-friendly wearable devices. Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on conjugated polymers or small molecules are promising sensor platforms because they have various advantages, including high sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and low-cost fabrication processes. OFET-based sensors enable continuous monitoring of external stimuli or target analytes with superior detection capabilities. This review describes the working principles and sensing mechanisms of various OFET-based sensors, including chemical, biological, photo, pressure, and temperature sensors, and introduces the recent progress in this field. In addition, the technical challenges and future outlook of OFET-based sensors for next-generation flexible electronics are briefly discussed.",

We show that monitoring tools and control channels of testbeds allow for identification of crucial issues (e.g., energy consumption, link quality) and we identify some opportunities to leverage those real-life obstacles. In this context, we insist on how simulations and experimentations can be efficiently and successfully coupled with each other in order to obtain reproducible scientific results, rather than sole proofs-of-concept. Indeed, we especially highlight the main characteristics of such evaluation tools that allow to run multiple instances of a same experimental setup over stable and finely controlled components of hardware and real-world environment. For our experiments, we used and evaluated the FIT IoT-LAB facility. Our results show that such open platforms, can guarantee a certain stability of hardware and environment components over time, thus, turning the unexpected failures and changing parameters into core experimental parameters and valuable inputs for enhanced performance evaluation.",

This study introduces an integrated assignment-allocation model that combines three issues: customer-facility assignments, allocation of fortification resources and data envelopment analysis (DEA). To justify the approach used to deal with a more reasonable solution for real world applications, we consider the outputs of the model as a function of the assignment variables. In new proposed model, the DEA efficiency measure is used to allocate fortification resources and select the best facilities for serving the customers after interdiction operations. For this purpose, we present a new bi-objective optimization model that optimally serves customers’ demands in a remarkably efficient manner and allocates fortification resources to relieve potential disaster, including interdiction operations. Also, Internet of Things (IoT) optimizes the performance of the customers and enhances the safety of facilities. Indeed, a new parking management system based on IoT is proposed to assist parking drivers in managing and handling parking in the presence of protection and interdiction operations considerably. The proposed model is multi-objective and Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP)-hard; so, a weighted metric approach by using the CPLEX solver through MATLAB and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) are utilized in problem solving. Several numerical instances are generated and solved by CPLEX and NSGA II. Experimental results show that NSGA II solves instances in considerably less time than CPLEX. Besides, it is seen that none of the solutions obtained by these two approaches are not dominated.",

It assumes that we can recognize the current action undertaken by the monitored subject on the basis of outputs of a set of associated sensors. Often different combinations of smart devices are being used, thus creating an Internet of Things. Such data will arrive continuously during the operation time of sensors and require an online processing in order to keep a real-time track of the current activity being undertaken. This forms a natural data stream problem with the potential presence of changes in the arriving data. Therefore, we require an efficient online machine learning system that can offer high recognition rates and adapt to drifts and shifts in the stream. In this paper we propose an efficient and lightweight adaptive ensemble learning system for real-time activity recognition. We use a weighted modification of Naïve Bayes classifier that can swiftly adapt itself to the current state of the stream without a need for an external concept drift detector. To tackle the multi-class nature of activity recognition problem we propose to use an one-vs-one decomposition to form a committee of simpler and diverse learners. We introduce a novel weighted combination for one-vs-one decomposition that can adapt itself over time. Additionally, to limit the cost of supervision we propose to enhance our classification system with active learning paradigm to select only the most important objects for labeling and work under constrained budget. Experiments carried out on six data streams gathered from ubiquitous environments show that the proposed active and adaptive ensemble offer excellent classification accuracy with low requirement for access to true class labels.",

While the traditional view of the healthcare systems architecture considered only clinical information systems and healthcare facilities, as the future Internet-of-Things becomes a reality, mobile devices, sensors, tags and other identifiable resources with communication and processing capability need to be taken in the picture. In such complex circumstances, the perception of interoperability needs to evolve from the consideration of interoperating pairs of systems to the capability of an autonomous system to sense, interpret, understand and act upon arbitrary messages received from a potentially unknown sender. In this sense, interoperability becomes in fact a property of the system. In this paper, we elaborate on an evolved concept of interoperability in context of ubiquitous healthcare systems. Then, we identify the enabling factors for the interoperable systems involved in pervasive healthcare and assess the impact the Interoperability as a Property (IaaP) paradigm would have on the healthcare landscape and challenges.",

In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs associated with smart house architecture evaluation.",

This paper considers the typically contradicting requirements for EE and QoS provisioning in an integrated manner for an IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network (WSN). Specifically, we consider variable traffic conditions of IoT applications in the presence of an energy harvesting technique based on the movement of vehicles. To this end, we introduce an adaptive energy-efficient algorithm, referred to as ABSD, that adapts the medium access control (MAC) parameters of IEEE 802.15.4 sensor nodes in response to the queue occupancy level of sensor nodes and the offered traffic load levels. By adapting the transmission parameters, the ABSD algorithm minimizes the network contention level which could in turn improve the EE as well as the network throughput. The ABSD algorithm is further enhanced by integrating with an energy harvesting technique and a new MAC parameter known as the ‘energy backoff’. The enhanced algorithm referred to as EH-ABSD offers priority to different classes of traffic by improving the battery lifetime and QoS values under variable traffic load conditions. Numerical results confirm that our proposed algorithms achieve high EE and QoS values while extending the lifetime of sensor nodes for outdoor applications.",

In this work, we analyze the impact on LPWANs energy consumption of multi-hop communication in the uplink, allowing STAs to transmit data packets in lower power levels and higher data rates to closer parent STAs, reducing their energy consumption consequently. To that aim, we introduce the Distance-Ring Exponential Stations Generator (DRESG) framework,11All of the source code in DRESG framework for LPWANs is open [1], encouraging sharing of algorithms between contributors and providing the ability for people to improve on the work of others under the GNU General Public License v3.0. designed to evaluate the performance of the so-called optimal-hop routing model, which establishes optimal routing connections in terms of energy efficiency, aiming to balance the consumption among all the STAs in the network. Results show that enabling such multi-hop connections entails higher network lifetimes, reducing significantly the bottleneck consumption in LPWANs with up to thousands of STAs. These results lead to foresee multi-hop communication in the uplink as a promising routing alternative for extending the lifetime of LPWAN deployments.",

Workers at tertiary health facilities may be expected to have good knowledge of cervical cancer and also good screening practices so that they could be good sources of health information and motivation to promote screening in the general public. An assessment of their perceptions and practice of cervical screening could reveal gaps that would inspire efforts to improve key indicators among them and in turn, the general population.
Methods
This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 316 workers of a tertiary health facility selected by stratified random sampling with proportionate allocation. Data was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires and analysed with SPSS 20 and PEPI programs.
Results
The majority of respondents were aware of cervical cancer but it was significantly higher among females, p=.001. Most respondents, 266 (84.2%) were less than 40 years of age but knowledge of cervical cancer screening diminished with increase in age, p=.039. Only 92 (29%) had good knowledge of cervical screening; a better knowledge of cervical screening was significantly associated with working in a clinical department, employment duration of less than 2 years, and being female. All females who had ever screened for Ca cervix, 18 (11%) had a Pap smear, and majority 15 (83%) had screened only once. Factors associated with screening were level of education, years of work experience, and being in a clinical department. Reasons given for not screening included pain from the procedure, its cost, and the delay with getting results.
Conclusion
Knowledge of cervical screening was not good among staff of DELSUTH and practice of screening was also very poor. They may benefit from health education and promotion programmes directed towards better screening practices. Introduction of easier-to-perform and less costly screening modalities like VIA/VILI may also improve uptake.",

The firm desires to target initial niche markets for a subset of this product. This may be a better approach than bearing the high expense for the one time effort of only entering the medical market. Several initial niche markets appear attractive. These include: home care, asthma management, fitness/lifestyle, wellness, and hospital care. The question is, “Which one is more attractive?” By formulating this decision problem as a hierarchical decision model (HDM) with the different niche markets as the alternatives and selecting various levels of criteria we were able to address this question. An expert panel consisting of the firm׳s executive and operational management, subject matter experts, and external industry analysts was selected to obtain its collective judgments. The results representing the expert panel׳s judgment indicated that asthma management and home care markets were most attractive and the other three were given less relative importance.

The aim is to ensure the security of patients’ healthcare data, realize access control for normal and emergency scenarios, and support smart deduplication to save the storage space in big data storage system. The medical files generated by the healthcare IoT network are encrypted and transferred to the storage system, which can be securely shared among the healthcare staff from different medical domains leveraging a cross-domain access control policy. The traditional access control technology allows the authorized data users to decrypt patient’s sensitive medical data, but also hampers the first-aid treatment when the patient’s life is threatened because the on-site first-aid personnel are not permitted to get patient’s historical medical data. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. In normal application, the healthcare staff with proper attribute secret keys can have the data access privilege; in emergency application, patient’s historical medical data can be recovered using a password-based break-glass access mechanism. To save the storage overhead in the big data storage system, a secure deduplication method is designed to eliminate the duplicate medical files with identical data, which may be encrypted with different access policies. A highlight of this smart secure deduplication method is that the remaining medical file after the deduplication can be accessed by all the data users authorized by the different original access policies. This smart healthcare big data storage system is formally proved secure, and extensive comparison and simulations demonstrate its efficiency.",

Different e-health strategies may produce different long-term results, so it is of general interest to look into strategies behind e-health approaches, and what factors that influence strategy-formation.
Problem statement
Previous studies into process improvements in the e-health area has suggested that approaches and strategies are very dependent on national contexts. This study explores this issue, by sampling two national regions in Europe, the St. Gallen region and canton in Switzerland, and the Agder region comprised of the two Agder-counties, in Norway. The research questions revolve around the extent to which the context influences e-health innovation in two different European regions.
Approach
To throw light on the area of concern, the author performed a cross-sectional case-study into publicly known e-health research and innovation projects or implementation projects in the two regions at comparable level of analysis; transparent (public) collaborative projects with more than one autonomous partner, at least one being from the regions research-institutions or governmental bodies.
Results
This study reports that there were some different regional convergences within the mentioned framework. In general there seems to be a gap concerning studies around the extension of clinical systems into homecare in St. Gallen, and a gap concerning more cross-sectional, holistic studies in Agder.
Conclusions
This article summarizes by pointing out themes for further research that needs more attention, both in general and within each of the two contexts, as a recommendation to the research community. These themes may also have implications for practice.",

abstract = "In the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables, large losses may incurred throughout the whole farm to fork route. Food supply chain management is faced with challenges of minimizing the post-harvest loss, while delivering the items directly to the refrigerators in smart homes (i.e. domotics). A substantial value can therefore be added to the criterion function by an immediate, real-time detection of changes in perishability dynamics, including a real-time calculation and communication of the remaining shelf life during transportation from one chain node to another. The changes in the estimated remaining shelf life can, therefore, be matched with the expected remaining transportation time, and so the critical moment can be avoided with a given probability. This can be done by dynamic rerouting in real time, based on previous net present value (NPV) criteria. Such criteria could then we include in the contractually stipulated remaining shelf life requirements at the delivery point. This paper focuses on a novel concept of moving activity cells which represent the moving cargo between the fixed activity cells in the extended material requirements planning (EMRP) model. The changes in NPV are calculated dynamically from the expected shelf life changes. Such real-time calculations and early reports are enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations. These early estimations allow a better decision making based on first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for perishable products. Therefore, the model includes the possibility to deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually stipulated shelf-life losses become too high. The paper does not intend to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it wishes to show how the EMRP theory can be used to estimate the changes in NPV when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves NPV by the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest logistics.",

abstract = "In home health care (HHC) services, nurses or professional caregivers are dispatched to patients’ homes to provide medical care services, such that each patient can stay at home to be treated periodically. The HHC problem consists of the nurse rostering problem (NRP) and the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), both of which are NP-hard problems, which are harder or equal to the hardest problem in the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem class and generally cannot be solved efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, the previous algorithmic approaches were designed to separately address NRP and VRPTW of the HHC problem. However, NRP and VRPTW of the HHC problem are intercorrelated, and their respective optimal objectives may be in conflict with each other in many cases. Additionally, the problem generally involves too many constraints to be solved, and most previous works did not address occurrence of sudden incidents in HHC services (e.g., a nurse or a patient suddenly requests for a leave, and a patient suddenly changes the time slot to be treated) such that the original nurse roster could become infeasible. Under constraints of nurse qualifications, working laws, nurse preferences, and vehicle routing, the first model considers nurse rostering and vehicle routing concurrently to minimize total costs of nurse overtime and vehicle routing. The second model extends the first model with rerostering caused by occurrence of sudden incidents. Harmony search algorithm (HSA) has been shown to perform better in solving NRPs than conventional metaheuristics, and hence this work proposes an improved HSA with genetic and saturation schemes, in which the solution representation is designed to concurrently determine nurse rostering and vehicle routing. For the second rerostering model, inheritance and immigrant schemes are added to the HSA to adapt to the change caused by occurrence of sudden incidents. Experimental results show that the proposed HSA performs well and can adapt to the change caused by sudden incidents.",

Even though the ZigBee standard was formed with security in mind and lower consumption of power, still zigbee based wireless sensor & ad-hoc networks routing protocol facing the severe security risks due to wormhole attacks in network layer. In order to investigate the security attacks in routing protocols, this paper analyzed the performance of Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) in IEEE 802.15.4 based Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in the presence of wormhole attacks. The metrics used to analyze the performance of reactive routing protocol (AODV), proactive (OLSR) and hybrid routing protocol (ZRP) in WSNs are throughput, average end-to-end delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and total energy consumption of sensor network.

abstract = "The massive introduction of internet, architect of the Internet of Thingsparadigm, was expected to facilitate the spread of people out of the urban spaces. However, the reality is that increasingly people are moving to cities, which generates many challenges for the cities of tomorrow. In this context, the Smart Cityconcept emerges, where Information and Communication Technologies have a key role. This situation has revealed an important issue that needs to be addressed: the lack of an ubiquitous communication architecture able to deal with the expected requirements of a SC. To this end, a wide review of the existing communication frameworks and city services have been performed, which showed that existing proposals are classical fixed ad-hocsolutions for very specific problems with no resilience and common thread. By rethinking the nature of cities and considering them as living organisms, it is possible to relate the nervous systems with the communication architecture of a city. Therefore, this work proposes a novel communication architecture, ubiquitous and resilient, inspired in the human nervous system by the definition of Smart Gateways, able to satisfy the needs of a real SCand adaptable to the growing and specific requirements of every single city. Additionally, the research also includes the simulation of the communication channel with different technologies.",

abstract = "Driven by the possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT), global information and communication technology (ICT) firms have taken significant steps forward in recent years. The Internet provides extraordinary services to people while promoting a free culture. However, such services cannot be captured through gross domestic product (GDP) data that measure revenue. Consequently, advancement of the Internet leads to increasing dependency on uncaptured GDP (added value providing people utility and happiness beyond economic value) and ICT price decreases. Against such circumstances, global ICT firms are quickly embracing digital solutions for new competitiveness that urge them to restructure their business model toward digital business strategies. Aiming at demonstrating this hypothetical view, this paper attempts to explore new approach for analyzing such dynamism and examines some optimal solutions that are co-evolving with it. An empirical analysis of digital business solutions in 500 global ICT firms over the period 2005–2016 was conducted with special attention to their specific features. It was identified that research and development–intensive firms have fallen into a trap in ICT advancement, resulting in a decline in their marginal productivity of ICT that could be due to increasing dependency on uncaptured GDP. As a result, these firms are endeavoring to harness soft innovation resources and activate a self-propagating function that induces functionality development sublimating sophisticated digital business strategies, such as: • Shifting from software to network (e.g., Apple and Google), • Merging network and real (e.g., Amazon's merging of e-commerce and brick-and-mortal retail), • Shifting from commodity to culture (e.g., Facebook and Samsung). All can be considered as soft value addition in response to uncaptured GDP. This analysis explores new insights for ICT firms in their transformative strategies toward an IoT-based society.",

However, many home automation devices lack robust security and are vulnerable to a multitude of bit-level attacks. This was highlighted during the first successful Insteon network intrusion demonstration that occurred at DEF CON 23 using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) with YARD Stick One devices. In response, Radio Frequency Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) Fingerprinting is introduced here as a counter-hacking approach for augmenting network bit-level Identity (ID) authentication using Physical Layer (PHY) waveform features. An RF-DNA Fingerprinting process is adopted here and applied to wireless Insteon home automation devices. Rogue device detection is addressed using a Multiple Discriminant Analysis/Maximum Likelihood (MDA/ML) ID verification process. Rogue assessments include attacks by like-model Insteon Switch (IS) devices and YARD Stick One SDR devices programmed to present actual (false) bit-level credentials for authorized Insteon devices while functionally controlling the state of an unprotected (no RF-DNA discrimination) targeted end point device. Device classification and Rogue Rejection Rate (RRR) performance is assessed using Time Domain (TD) and Slope-Based Frequency Shift Keyed (SB-FSK) Fingerprinting with features extracted from a variant (data dependent) signal response region. The Rogue Rejection Rate (RRR) for SB-FSK Fingerprinting was superior to TD Fingerprinting and included RRR ≈ 95% for 25 like-model IS attacks and RRR ≈ 100% for 36 YARD Stick One SDR attacks. SB-FSK Fingerprinting is more computationally efficient (70% fewer features) than TD Fingerprinting and provides an added benefit of being implementable using features extracted from variant data dependent FSK signal response regions.",

But differences are at the possibilities of modern ergonomics, movement of science and technical possibilities. The options of using a mobile applications, Internet of Things, data gathering and their real time evaluation and their sharing. We present those solutions that combine traditional knowledge and modern technologies. The results are innovative and advanced ergonomic tools based on Industry 4.0 concept. Electronic tools are a new direction in ergonomics. With the support of mobile applications we see a way to create healthy conditions at work for production and also non-production workers, assembly and logistics. At the beginning of 20-th century, majority of us had no idea what the ergonomics is, how many risks occur during our job that they are connected with the health of employees and have not known that special methods and tools for their identification, analysis, evaluation and identification are developed. With the growing development of society we got to stadium when, luckily, majority of companies – employers even know the meaning of ergonomics or work risks, about risks at their workplaces and establish their evaluation and try to eliminate them. We have many methods and tools of modern ergonomics which enable us to realize analysis and optimization of employee's work to their benefit. Considering experience we can surely claim that we know the main problem of these days. It is requisite to realize ergonomic evaluation perfectly, extensively and mainly quickly. Slowness of some solutions discourages managers and directors and makes effective improving of work conditions impossible. The idea of mobile application developing which works as a screening tool came with demands from big companies that have dozens of workplaces and cannot identify work risks by themselves. Ceit ERgonomics Analysis Application, which is described in article, is output of our own research and development. It is a mobile application developed in CEIT Company in collaboration with the University of Žilina and Slovak ergonomic association. It is a screening evaluation of space conditions and work positions of workers at potentially risky workplaces. It is developed at the base of legislation and technical norms, at our own platform, with the support of virtual and augmented reality. The main goal of evaluation by the CERAA usage is to find out if the workplace is risky from the ergonomic view. It is an innovative way of applied augmented reality tools during the ergonomic evaluation of chosen workplaces. Nowadays, the new submodules are being developed. They will identify risks at administrative workplaces, submodule which will evaluate working with loads and other that will evaluate repetitive operations. CERAA is used in several industrial companies in Slovakia and Czech Republic from the second half of 2016.",

Therefore, a channel model of the communication is expressed by capacitive ambient elements. Such a communication is greatly affected by external noise because the balance of the transmission path deteriorates due to environmental factors. There is a serious problem in that radiated noise via the human body emitted from an electric light or peripheral electronic equipment is likely to be transmitted along the same path as a signal by capacitance coupling. We investigated a channel model and estimated radiated noise via the human body based on experiments and circuit simulation. The validity of the channel model was clarified from noise measurement. When an additional electrode was connected to a ground electrode in a measurement system for a practical scene, the noise reduction rating was 5.11dB. However, actually, reducing the noise is difficult. Therefore, reducing the noise source in such a communication is necessary.",

abstract = "In the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables, large losses may incurred throughout the whole farm to fork route. Food supply chain management is faced with challenges of minimizing the post-harvest loss, while delivering the items directly to the refrigerators in smart homes (i.e. domotics). A substantial value can therefore be added to the criterion function by an immediate, real-time detection of changes in perishability dynamics, including a real-time calculation and communication of the remaining shelf life during transportation from one chain node to another. The changes in the estimated remaining shelf life can, therefore, be matched with the expected remaining transportation time, and so the critical moment can be avoided with a given probability. This can be done by dynamic rerouting in real time, based on previous net present value (NPV) criteria. Such criteria could then we include in the contractually stipulated remaining shelf life requirements at the delivery point. This paper focuses on a novel concept of moving activity cells which represent the moving cargo between the fixed activity cells in the extended material requirements planning (EMRP) model. The changes in NPV are calculated dynamically from the expected shelf life changes. Such real-time calculations and early reports are enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations. These early estimations allow a better decision making based on first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for perishable products. Therefore, the model includes the possibility to deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually stipulated shelf-life losses become too high. The paper does not intend to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it wishes to show how the EMRP theory can be used to estimate the changes in NPV when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves NPV by the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest logistics.",

abstract = "Ultra-low power operation and extreme energy efficiency are strong requirements for a number of high-growth application areas, such as E-health, Internet of Things, and wearable Human–Computer Interfaces. A promising approach to achieve up to one order of magnitude of improvement in energy efficiency over current generation of integrated circuits is near-threshold computing. However, frequency degradation due to aggressive voltage scaling may not be acceptable across all performance-constrained applications. Thread-level parallelism over multiple cores can be used to overcome the performance degradation at low voltage. Moreover, enabling the processors to operate on-demand and over a wide supply voltage and body bias ranges allows to achieve the best possible energy efficiency while satisfying a large spectrum of computational demands. In this work we present the first ever implementation of a 4-core cluster fabricated using conventional-well 28nm UTBB FD-SOI technology. The multi-core architecture we present in this work is able to operate on a wide range of supply voltages starting from 0.44V to 1.2V. In addition, the architecture allows a wide range of body bias to be applied from −1.8V to 0.9V. The peak energy efficiency 60 GOPS/W is achieved at 0.5V supply voltage and 0.5V forward body bias. Thanks to the extended body bias range of conventional-well FD-SOI technology, high energy efficiency can be guaranteed for a wide range of process and environmental conditions. We demonstrate the ability to compensate for up to 99.7% of chips for process variation with only ±0.2V of body biasing, and compensate temperature variation in the range −40°C to 120°C exploiting −1.1V to 0.8V body biasing. When compared to leading-edge near-threshold RISC processors optimized for extremely low power applications, the multi-core architecture we propose has 144× more performance at comparable energy efficiency levels. Even when compared to other low-power processors with comparable performance, including those implemented in 28nm technology, our platform provides 1.4× to 3.7× better energy efficiency.",

Several applications in the IoT require the efficient and timely collection of larger amounts of data. Due to the interference and contention over the wireless medium, the limited bandwidth of the radios, the limited resources of the battery-operated sensor nodes, this requirement becomes a challenging task. In this research, we exploit the multi-channel operation capability of the radios to provide the higher network throughput and propose an efficient scheduling algorithm to eliminate collision, idle-listening or over-hearing, which are consequences of non-coordinated transmissions. Our work focuses on scheduling the regular traffic that is periodically transmitted and on adapting the schedule to the additional traffic that can be requested at some point in time. To deploy the schedule-based multi-channel protocol on real applications, we design the complete communication procedure that is necessary for sensor nodes to communicate among them to form a network and to propagate the sensed data to the collection point. We also propose a low-overhead time synchronization scheme that is critical for a schedule-based protocol. The results of extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can achieve collision-free parallel transmissions over different channels to provide high throughput and high delivery ratio while meeting the crucial energy efficiency requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol and the time synchronization scheme on a laboratory-scaled test-bed of real motes.",

abstract = "A body sensor network (BSN) is a type of network for Internet of Things. A BSN typically consists of tens (dozens) of biosensor nodes distributed on/in the human body, and these autonomous nodes can form a wireless network to measure physiological signals and execute intelligent treatment automatically. BSNs have wide application prospects in intelligent healthcare. Because physiological signals measured and processed by BSNs involve patient privacy, security mechanisms must be developed to secure BSNs, and therefore the adoption of available key negotiation protocols is fundamental. Due to stringently limited operation resources, BSNs require these protocols to be highly energy efficient. Recent development has discovered that certain physiological signals can be used for efficiently negotiating common keys among biosensor nodes. These signals and fuzzy technology are used to design lightweight key negotiation protocols, and many solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we explore and classify these solutions, and evaluate their performance by analyzing their merits and drawbacks. Finally, we present open research issues that should be solved in the future.",

In this paper I argue that such technological changes and their socioeconomic consequences signal the emergence of a global metasystem (i.e. control organization beyond markets and nation-states) and may require a qualitatively new level of political organization to guide a process of self-organization. Consequently, this paper proposes and attempts to develop a conceptual framework with the potential to aid an international political transition towards a ‘post-capitalist’ ‘post-nation state’ global world. This conceptual framework is grounded within sociotechnological theory of the ‘Global Brain’ (GB), which describes a potential future planetary organizational structure founded on distributed and open-ended intelligence; and the socioeconomic theory of the ‘Commons’, which is a paradigm describing distributed modes of organization founded upon principles of democratic management and open access. In the integration of GB theory and Commons theory this paper ultimately argues that an appropriate international response to the emerging technological revolution should include the creation of networks with both automated and collaborative components that function on ‘Global Commons’ (GC) logic (i.e. beyond both state and market logic).",

Then, we address such drawbacks by proposing a routing protocol, named GeoRank, which integrates RPL protocol with the position-based routing protocol GOAFR (Greedy Other Adaptive Face Routing). The results obtained with simulations show that GeoRank finds shorter routes than RPL in high link density conditions and than GOAFR in low link density conditions. Thus, GeoRank shows to be adaptive to variable link densities found in large-scale networks. Further, GeoRank avoids the use of DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) control messages required in RPL, while being more scalable in terms of memory usage than storing-mode RPL.",

abstract = "There has been a shift in research towards the convergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms motivated by the need for IoT applications to leverage the unique characteristics of the cloud. IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes “things” to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated against four established service composition algorithms in multiple cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, and COM2), with the results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.",

Traditionally, transits and data on mobility belong to a scattered plethora of operators. Thus, we argue that the economic model of MaaS is that of federations of providers, each trading its resources to coordinate multi-modal solutions for mobility. Such flexibility comes with many security and privacy concerns, of which insider threat is one of the most prominent. In this paper, we revise and extend previous work where we classified the potential threats of individual operators and markets of federated MaaS providers, proposing appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the problems. In addition, we consider the emerging case of Cloud-of-Things (CoT) for mobility, i.e., networks of ubiquitous, pervasive devices that provide real-time data on objects and people. Automation and pervasiveness of CoT make an additional attack surface for insiders. In an effort to limit such phenomenon, we present an overlay networking architecture, based on gossip protocols, that lets users share information on mobility with each other. A peculiarity of the architecture is that it both constrains the quality and quantity of data obtainable by insiders, optimizing the routing of requests to involve only users that are able to answer them.",

However, the wireless medium access is pointed as a problem for the next generations of wireless networks; hence, the number of data transmissions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can quickly become a bottleneck, disrupting the exponential growth in the number of interconnected devices, sensors, and amount of produced data. Therefore, keeping a low number of data transmissions is critical to incorporate new sensor nodes and measure a great variety of parameters in future generations of WSNs. Thanks to the high accuracy and low complexity of state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms, Dual Prediction Schemes (DPSs) are potential candidates to optimize the data transmissions in WSNs at the finest level because they facilitate for sensor nodes to avoid unnecessary transmissions without affecting the quality of their measurements. In this work, we present a sensor network model that uses statistical theorems to describe the expected impact of DPSs and data aggregation in WSNs. We aim to provide a foundation for future works by characterizing the theoretical gains of processing data in sensors and conditioning its transmission to the predictions’ accuracy. Our simulation results show that the number of transmissions can be reduced by almost 98% in the sensor nodes with the highest workload. We also detail the impact of predicting and aggregating transmissions according to the parameters that can be observed in common scenarios, such as sensor nodes’ transmission ranges, the correlation between measurements of different sensors, and the period between two consecutive measurements in a sensor.",

In real-world applications, with the deepening of cognition and improvements in technology, attribute values in an information system often evolve over time; in particular, there are three cases: when missing values are imputed, error values are corrected, and the values are coarsened or refined. This has posed challenges to developing efficient data analysis algorithms. In this paper, the changing mechanisms of the attribute values and fuzzy equivalence relations in FRS are analyzed. FRS approaches for incrementally updating approximations in HIS are presented. Moreover, two corresponding incremental algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experiments on eight data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an artificial data set show that incremental approaches can effectively improve the performance of updating approximations and not only significantly shorten the computational time, but also increase approximation classification accuracies.",

Therefore, the data structure can be easily defined and stored, without optimization needs, in the cards/tags. The problem with data structure appears when the application requirements define large, dynamic and miscellaneous information to be stored, such as an Electronic Health Record for e-Health application and a Truckload Record for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Therefore, that information needs to be carefully stored to reach the register that we are looking for very quickly and to optimize the card/tag space, which is very constrained. Consequently, this paper proposes a set of design issues and techniques to define the metadata structure in NFC/RFID tags and cards to reduce search time, read time and optimize capacity. For this paper has been defined an example of the metadata structure from a Pharmaceutical Information System, where the patient card based on MiFare stores drugs history, patient allergies and general patient information. The reduction of space reached for this solution following the design issues and techniques in this paper has been about 189%, a reduction of time to find a register reaching a direct access to the records, instead of sequential search, and consequently a reduction for read time.",

Information loss and common attacks possible on the anonymized data are serious challenges of anonymization. Recently, data anonymization using data mining techniques has showed significant improvement in data utility. Still the existing techniques lack in effective handling of attacks. Hence in this paper, an anonymization algorithm based on clustering and resilient to similarity attack and probabilistic inference attack is proposed. The anonymized data is distributed on Hadoop Distributed File System. The method achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility. In our work the data utility is measured in terms of accuracy and FMeasure with respect to different classifiers. Experiments show that the accuracy, FMeasure and the execution time of the classification algorithms on the privacy-preserved data sets formed by the proposed clustering algorithms are better than the existing algorithms.",

abstract = "In recent years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used for controlling remote devices and also for gathering sensor data of distributed WSN devices. The WSNs support current Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the background. However, it is becoming a salient issue that frequent packet delivery losses occur during data gathering on WSNs along with the increasing number of nodes. Two fundamental difficulties exist for MAC and upper layers on IEEE 802.15.4 standard: transmission collisions among two-hop away nodes, known as the “Hidden node problem,” and traffic congestion during data transfer that engenders buffer overflow at nodes. To resolve these difficulties, we propose a self-organizing network coordination framework for WSNs that realizes an adaptive time-division transmission by nodes and also traffic congestion handling in a decentralized manner. Specifically, the framework is based on a decentralized time division technique using a simplified pulse-coupled oscillator model. By coordinating the transmission timing adaptively, each node sends messages without collisions. “Hidden node problems” as well as “Exposed node problems” will be prevented, in principle, when using our method. Additionally, to reduce traffic congestion in a decentralized manner, time slots in the transmission cycle on each node are used efficiently by additional algorithms: an “empty time slots utilization algorithm” and a “takeover algorithm of neighboring nodes’ transmission slots”. These are introduced for efficient large data gathering applications. We simulated a 60-node data gathering application and evaluated its superiority to a conventional WSN method using CSMA/CA on IEEE 802.15.4 standard. We also conducted hardware experiments using nine developed WSN nodes and confirmed our framework’s feasibility in real situations targeted at real-time landslide detection with distributed WSN nodes.",

The utilization of federated resources is envisioned to increase the quality of service, cost benefits, and reliability. Resource management in the federation of multiple clouds is a pressing issue owing to the lack of cross-domain knowledge, security, trust, and administrative policies. This study classifies these resource management functions in the federated cloud environment into resource pricing, resource discovery, resource selection, resource monitoring, resource allocation, and disaster management. Each federated resource management function is discussed, and insights into state-of-the-art research are then provided. These resource management functions are also compared based on the performance metrics that are suitable for an individual function. Finally, we indicate the open challenges for further research with regard to each classified resource management function.",

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.",

In this paper, we provide an overview on the main research issues confronted by existing Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques, with an emphasis on query optimization aspects. Our study expands on both deterministic and probabilistic event models and spans from centralized to distributed network settings. In that, we cover a wide range of approaches in the CEP domain and review the current status of techniques that tackle efficient query processing. These techniques serve as a starting point for developing Big Data oriented CEP applications. Therefore, we further study the issues that arise upon trying to apply those techniques over Big Data enabling technologies, as is the case with cloud platforms. Furthermore, we expand on the synergies among Predictive Analytics and CEP with an emphasis on scalability and elasticity considerations in cloud platforms with potentially dispersed resource pools.",

Such protocols were designed for scenarios where only a few tags (typically just two) are involved, so issues such as preventing an object from abandoning the proof right after being interrogated simply do not make sense. The idea, however, is very interesting for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications where a potentially large population of objects must be grouped together. In this paper we address this issue by presenting the notion of Probabilistic Yoking Proofs (PYP) and introducing three main criteria to assess their performance: cost, security, and fairness. Our proposal combines the message structure found in classical grouping proof constructions with an iterative Poisson sampling process where the probability of each object being sampled varies over time. We introduce a number of mechanisms to apply fluctuations to each object’s sampling probability and present different sampling strategies. Our experimental results confirm that most strategies achieve good security and fairness levels while keeping the overall protocol cost down.",

Furthermore the global change towards a fully networked society is in progress, in Germany, in Europe, and of course in the United States – actually more or less all over the world. In this context one significant topic is the “Internet of things and services”. The digital transformation changes business and private life likewise – in a radically and sustainable way. The economic potential is enormous. Topics related to the networking of the internet by far have the most economical potential worldwide. The world becomes more and more digital. This is the Big Business of the future. Digitally networked and data-intensive are the main attributes of a smarter production, the so called industry 4.0. But not only in technology many things are changing, humans and the society transforms, too.

In order to promote sharing of data, mechanisms need to be put into place to provide the different actors — data producers, data consumers, etc. means to control and visualize how their data or requests are being processed and used. In this paper we deal with a key issue involved in trust which is usage control, i.e., how data is used once access to it has been granted. We propose a Data Usage Control Model (DUPO) to capture the diversity of obligations and constraints that data providers impose on the use of their data. Based on the DUPO model and semantic technologies, we propose a trustworthy data sharing platform which enhances transparency and traceability of data usage in smart cities. Lastly a proof-of-concept is developed to evaluate our solution and results show that the performance of the added trust does not impact negatively on the system.",

During the WCE procedure, a significant amount of redundant video data is generated, the transmission of which to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists securely for analysis is challenging as well as wastage of several resources including energy, memory, computation, and bandwidth. In addition to this, it is inherently difficult and time consuming for gastroenterologists to analyze this huge volume of gastrointestinal video data for desired contents. To surmount these issues, we propose a secure video summarization framework for outdoor patients going through WCE procedure. In the proposed system, keyframes are extracted using a light-weighted video summarization scheme, making it more suitable for WCE. Next, a cryptosystem is presented for security of extracted keyframes based on 2D Zaslavsky chaotic map. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed cryptosystem in terms of robustness and high-level security compared to other recent image encryption schemes during dissemination of important keyframes to healthcare centers and gastroenterologists for personalized WCE.",

By deploying internet of things (IoT) to infrastructure systems, high-volume and high-variety of data pertinent to the condition and performance of infrastructure systems along with the behaviors of citizens can be gathered, processed, integrated and analyzed through cloud-based infrastructure asset management systems, ubiquitous mobile applications and big data analytics platforms. Nonetheless, how to fully exploit the value of ‘big infrastructure data’ is still a key challenge facing most stakeholders. Unless data is shared by different infrastructure systems in an interoperable and consistent manner, it is difficult to realize the smart infrastructure concept for efficient smart city planning, not to mention about developing appropriate resilience and sustainable programs. To unlock the value of big infrastructure data for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, a master data management (MDM) solution is proposed in this paper. MDM has been adopted in the business sector to orchestrate operational and analytical big data applications. In order to derive a suitable MDM solution for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, commercial and open source MDM systems, smart city standards, smart city concept models, smart community infrastructure frameworks, semantic web technologies will be critically reviewed, and feedback and requirements will be gathered from experts who are responsible for developing smart, sustainable and resilient city programs. A case study which focuses on the building and transportation infrastructures of a selected community in Hong Kong will be conducted to pilot the proposed MDM solution.",

Although cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, cyberwars are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective.",

Sport Internet of Things (IoTs) based on the sensor technique and modern communication technology are becoming more and more important to current sport training and daily activities. Sensor-based sport monitoring approaches lead people to take advantage of the wearable sport devices to monitor their own physiological parameters, in which we will focus on the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse measurement. In order to measure these two parameters, we will adopt near-infrared portable tissue oximeter with detection module using STM32 microprocessor. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is becoming a widely used research instrument to measure tissue oxygen (O2) status non-invasively. Continuous-wave spectrometers are the most commonly used devices, which provide semi-quantitative changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in small blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries and venules). Through the measurement using the near-infrared technology, we could obtain the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse parameters. After obtaining the above two parameters, the portable device will send the data to the remote coaches or doctors via GPRS/WiFi/Zigbee networks. The data of the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse that is detected by the detection module are processed by the expert decision-making system in order to provide the coaches and doctors with the athlete condition. In addition, the data can be sent to the smart phones of the players, coaches or doctors through GPRS/WiFi networks, in which the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse data of the athletes can be displayed according to the requirement of the remote users. The test results show that the accuracy of measurement is high and the system is stable.",

The proposal of the SGA is newly suggested to improve the gateway application (GA) of the ITU-T M2M service layer in the IoTs reference model.

The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing.",

Such developments are enabling the automation of more and more industrial practices, and are driving the need to replace conventional planning techniques with schemes that can utilize the capabilities of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The future is a place where intelligence is endowed to every entity on the shop floor, and to realize this vision, it is necessary to develop new schemes that can unlock the potential of decentralized data observation and decision-making. Maintenance planning is one such decision-making activity that has evolved over the years to make production more efficient by reducing unplanned downtime and improving product quality. In this work, a distributed algorithm is developed that performs intelligent maintenance planning for identical parallel multi-component machines in a job-shop manufacturing scenario. The algorithm design fits intuitively into the CPS-IIoT paradigm without exacting any additional infrastructure, and is a demonstration of how the paradigm can be effectively deployed. Due to the decentralized nature of the algorithm, its runtime scales with complexity of the problem in terms of number of machines; and the runtime for complex cases is of only a few minutes. The supremacy of the devised algorithm is demonstrated over conventional centralized heuristics such as Memetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization.",

To provide a domain-independent platform and take full benefits from semantic technologies, in this paper we present an Automated Complex Event Implementation System (ACEIS), which serves as a middleware between sensor data streams and smart city applications. ACEIS not only automatically discovers and composes IoT streams in urban infrastructures for users’ requirements expressed as complex event requests, but also automatically generates stream queries in order to detect the requested complex events, bridging the gap between high-level application users and low-level information sources.

Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

Current research in this line mostly focuses on discovery, e.g., designing efficient searching methods by exploiting the geographical properties of sensing devices. The problem of ranking, which aims to prioritise semantically equivalent sensor services returned by the discovery process, has not been adequately studied. Existing methods mostly leverage the information directly associated with sensor services, such as detailed service descriptions or quality of service information. However, assuming the availability of such information for sensor services is often unrealistic. We propose a ranking strategy by estimating the cost of accessing sensor services. The computation is based on properties of the sensor nodes as well as the relevant contextual information extracted from the service access process. The evaluation results demonstrate not only the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of ranking quality measure, but also the potential for preserving the energy of the sensor nodes.",

abstract = "Background and objectives
Recent advances in miniature biomedical sensors, mobile smartphones, wireless communications, and distributed computing technologies provide promising techniques for developing mobile health systems. Such systems are capable of monitoring epileptic seizures reliably, which are classified as chronic diseases. Three challenging issues raised in this context with regard to the transformation, compression, storage, and visualization of big data, which results from a continuous recording of epileptic seizures using mobile devices.
Methods
In this paper, we address the above challenges by developing three new algorithms to process and analyze big electroencephalography data in a rigorous and efficient manner. The first algorithm is responsible for transforming the standard European Data Format (EDF) into the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and compressing the transformed JSON data to decrease the size and time through the transfer process and to increase the network transfer rate. The second algorithm focuses on collecting and storing the compressed files generated by the transformation and compression algorithm. The collection process is performed with respect to the on-the-fly technique after decompressing files. The third algorithm provides relevant real-time interaction with signal data by prospective users. It particularly features the following capabilities: visualization of single or multiple signal channels on a smartphone device and query data segments.
Results
We tested and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a software architecture model implementing a mobile health system to monitor epileptic seizures. The experimental findings from 45 experiments are promising and efficiently satisfy the approach's objectives in a price of linearity. Moreover, the size of compressed JSON files and transfer times are reduced by 10% and 20%, respectively, while the average total time is remarkably reduced by 67% through all performed experiments.
Conclusions
Our approach successfully develops efficient algorithms in terms of processing time, memory usage, and energy consumption while maintaining a high scalability of the proposed solution. Our approach efficiently supports data partitioning and parallelism relying on the MapReduce platform, which can help in monitoring and automatic detection of epileptic seizures.",

abstract = "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are nowadays considered as an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT). In these networks, data aggregation plays an essential role in energy preservation. However, WSNs are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments (e.g. military applications) in which the confidentiality and integrity security services are widely desired. Recently, homomorphic encryptions have been applied to conceal sensitive information during aggregation such that algebraic operations are done directly on ciphertexts without decryption. The main benefit is that they offer the end-to-end data confidentiality and they do not require expensive computation at aggregator nodes since no encryption and decryption are performed. However, existing solutions either incur a considerable overhead or have limited applicability to certain types of aggregate queries. This paper presents a novel secure data aggregation protocol for WSNs. The scheme employs Stateful Public Key Encryption (StPKE) and some previous techniques in order to provide an efficient end-to-end security. Moreover, our solution does not impose any bound on the aggregation function’s nature (Maximum, Minimum, Average, etc.). We present and implement our scheme on TelosB as well as MicaZ sensor network platforms and measure the execution time of our various cryptographic functions. Simulations are also conducted to show how our scheme can achieve a high security level (by providing the above security services) with a low overhead (in terms of computation and communication) in large-scale scenario.",

This data can be badly expressed, understood, and exploited by other systems and devices. Additionally, the huge amount of connected objects embeds with resource-constrained devices (sensors, actuators, RFIDS, etc.) are also challenging. Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology. The second contribution is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of this ontology. In fact, an IoT Medicare system is proposed to evaluate the HealthIoT ontology.",

abstract = "The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) recently released a set of specifications for a reference architecture to globally access resources provided by machines over heterogeneous technologies in an interoperable way through a RESTful interface. Resources are named through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) at the application layer and typically reachable at the network layer through IP connectivity. Such an approach can be used also to access extremely resource-constrained devices, provided that lightweight interactions with a gateway, remotely exposing their resources, are granted. Among potential alternatives to support communication between the gateway and such constrained devices, we investigate the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, gaining momentum in the future Internet research arena. It differs from the host-centric IP networking in that it cares for the content to retrieve instead of the device hosting it. By directly using content names at the network layer and a receiver-driven communication, ICN well fits the requirements of many machine-to-machine (M2M) applications that are information-centric in nature and rely on a publish-subscribe service model. In this paper, we propose an ICN-based solution to be deployed on top of constrained devices whose named resources are exposed at a wide area scope by an M2M gateway. The proposal aims at ensuring easy interoperability with ETSI M2M specifications, thus allowing remote applications to access the resources of ICN-enabled nodes. To showcase the viability of our proposal, a test-bed has been deployed leveraging low-cost devices for home automation. Experimental results confirm a good performance in terms of device resources consumption, easiness of implementation and latency of communication.",

M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications represent one of the main pillars of the new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), and is making possible new opportunities for the eHealth business. Nevertheless, the large number of M2M protocols currently available hinders the election of a suitable solution that satisfies the requirements that can demand eHealth applications.
Objectives
In the first place, to develop a tool that provides a benchmarking analysis in order to objectively select among the most relevant M2M protocols for eHealth solutions. In the second place, to validate the tool with a particular use case: the respiratory rehabilitation.
Methods
A software tool, called Distributed Computing Framework (DFC), has been designed and developed to execute the benchmarking tests and facilitate the deployment in environments with a large number of machines, with independence of the protocol and performance metrics selected.
Results
DDS, MQTT, CoAP, JMS, AMQP and XMPP protocols were evaluated considering different specific performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, bandwidth consumption, latency and jitter. The results obtained allowed to validate a case of use: respiratory rehabilitation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in two scenarios with different types of requirement: Home-Based and Ambulatory.
Conclusions
The results of the benchmark comparison can guide eHealth developers in the choice of M2M technologies. In this regard, the framework presented is a simple and powerful tool for the deployment of benchmark tests under specific environments and conditions.",

Using WiMAX as backhaul service, the Internet connection can be provided for dispersed mobile LR-WPAN users over a wide area. Moreover, it enables to access all collected data in the local LR-WPAN coverage area – which is named as Senspot in this paper – by third-party clients through the Internet. Furthermore, an analytic model has been developed for the integrated network to evaluate the system's performance.

A primary concern in HIEs is the need for explicit authorization of information exchange in an auditable manner. However, we find that existing approaches for authorization in health information systems exhibit several drawbacks in meeting the needs of HIE, with non-cryptographic approaches lacking a secure and reliable mechanism for access policy enforcement, while cryptographic approaches being too expensive, complex and limited in specifying policies. This paper aims to overcome these drawbacks by presenting a simple and efficient patient-centric authorization protocol for information sharing in cloud-based HIE systems. The proposed protocol is built using a novel trapdoor hash-based proxy signature scheme, and ensures that the authorization is authentic with respect to both providers and patients, and complies with the established access control policies. Features of the proposed protocol include auditability, non-interactive and on-demand operation, and specification and secure/reliable enforcement of flexible access control policies. A detailed security and performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol is provably secure against forgery under the discrete log assumption, and achieves the best overall performance compared to other well-known schemes in the literature.",

To improve both execution efficiency and searching accuracy, the proposed algorithm searches the compressing method of the Lucene index and then filters that index. Simulations are conducted on a Storm platform to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can increase the response speed by 67.79% with an accuracy of 95.94%, and the response speed decreases by 11.6–53.2%.",

abstract = "This paper proposes a novel theory for managing a holistic supply chain network, for proactive resilience. A holistic or inter-industrial supply chain network (H-SCN for short), is a system with the nature that several supply chain networks intertwine and inter-dependent to each other to form a more sophisticated network. It is believed that management of such a supply chain network has a close tie to financial crisis in 2008 and subsequent global economic recession. By proactive resilience it is meant that the disruption of supply business in future could be avoided at large if not all. The proposed theory includes a model that represents the economic health of a firm in the context of a supply-demand network. The model captures not only a firm’s own resource and capability but also its supplier (upstream firm) and its consumer (downstream firm). How the resilience of such an H-SCN system can be enhanced is demonstrated by a potential technique to share the information of the health state of firm and the knowledge of disruptions over the entire network in future if one or more firms in the network fail to function.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.",

abstract = "Defects and errors in new or recently completed construction work continually pervade the industry. Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.",

abstract = "The field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), embedded systems with sensing and networking capability, has now matured after a decade-long research effort and technological advances in electronics and networked systems. An important remaining challenge now is to extract meaningful information from the ever-increasing amount of sensor data collected by WSNs. In particular, there is strong interest in algorithms capable of automatic detection of patterns, events or other out-of-the order, anomalous system behavior. Data anomalies may indicate states of the system that require further analysis or prompt actions. Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are executed in a central processing facility, which requires the collection of all measurement data at a central location, an obvious limitation for WSNs due to the high data communication costs involved. In this paper we explore the extent by which one may depart from this classical centralized paradigm, looking at decentralized anomaly detection based on unsupervised machine learning. Our aim is to detect anomalies at the sensor nodes, as opposed to centrally, to reduce energy and spectrum consumption. We study the information gain coming from aggregate neighborhood data, in comparison to performing simple, in-node anomaly detection. We evaluate the effects of neighborhood size and spatio-temporal correlation on the performance of our new neighborhood-based approach using a range of real-world network deployments and datasets. We find the conditions that make neighborhood data fusion advantageous, identifying also the cases in which this approach does not lead to detectable improvements. Improvements are linked to the diffusive properties of data (spatio-temporal correlations) but also to the type of sensors, anomalies and network topological features. Overall, when a dataset stems from a similar mixture of diffusive processes precision tends to benefit, particularly in terms of recall. Our work paves the way towards understanding how distributed data fusion methods may help managing the complexity of wireless sensor networks, for instance in massive Internet of Things scenarios.",

Methodologically, a cost minimization algorithm is used to analyze a large industry service and warranty data sets and two analytical decision models were developed and applied to a case study for an electrical circuit breaker maintenance problem. Some of these techniques can be applied to other industries, such as jet engine maintenance, and can be expanded to others with implications for robust decision analysis. The SMDSS provides a predictive analytical model that can be applied in manufacturing and service based industries. Our findings and results show that existing solution algorithms and optimization models can be applied to large data sets to lay out executable decisions for managers.",

In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry.

This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry.

In order to develop ubiquitous environmental monitoring system suitable for the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the high-sensitivity and fast-response detection of NO2 gas at low concentrations is of particular importance. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown fast response/recovery characteristics in the detection of NO2, due to their planar crystal structures, large surface-to-volume ratios, and low electronic noise. Among these materials, tin disulfide has shown superior sensing performances, at the parts-per-million (ppm) level, in addition to fast response and good stability. Therefore, here we report the synthesis of 2D SnS2 materials via high-energy ball milling (HEBM), followed by characterization of the crystal structures and morphologies of the products by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The use of the present SnS2 nanomaterial as a NO2 sensor enables the detection of a wide range of gas concentrations (from parts-per-billion (ppb) to ppm levels) with fast response and high sensitivity, at an optimal operating temperature of 250°C. Under these conditions, the sensor exhibited a response >2000% and response/recovery times of 6/40s at an NO2 concentration of 10ppm. Finally, the sensor developed in this work also produced highly repeatable and linear responses.",

This paper presents the results of an online survey investigating perceptions within citizen science communities, environmental institutes and their networks of formal and informal environmental sensing data. The results show that citizens and experts had different views of formal and informal environmental sensing data, particularly on measurement frequency and the data information provision power. However, there was agreement, too, for example, on the accuracy of formal environmental sensing data. Furthermore, both agreed that the integration of formal and informal environmental sensing data offered potential for improvements on several aspects, particularly spatial coverage, data quantity and measurement frequency. Interestingly, the accuracy of informal environmental sensing data was largely unknown to both experts and citizens. This suggests the need for further investigation of informal environmental sensing data and the potential for its effective integration with formal environmental sensing data, if hurdles like standardisation can be overcome.",

Extensive deployment and sustainability of integrated care services (ICS) constitute an unmet need to reduce the burden of chronic conditions. The European Union project NEXES (2008–2013) assessed the deployment of four ICS encompassing the spectrum of severity of chronic patients.
Objective
The current study aims to (i) describe the open source Adaptive Case Management (ACM) system (Linkcare®) developed to support the deployment of ICS at the level of healthcare district; (ii) to evaluate its performance; and, (iii) to identify key challenges for regional deployment of ICS.
Methods
We first defined a conceptual model for ICS management and execution composed of five main stages. We then specified an associated logical model considering the dynamic runtime of ACM. Finally, we implemented the four ICS as a physical model with an ICS editor to allow professionals (case managers) to play active roles in adapting the system to their needs. Instances of ICS were then run in Linkcare®. Four ICS provided a framework for evaluating the system: Wellness and Rehabilitation (W&R) (number of patients enrolled in the study (n)=173); Enhanced Care (EC) in frail chronic patients to prevent hospital admissions, (n=848); Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (HH/ED) (n=2314); and, Support to remote diagnosis (Support) (n=7793). The method for assessment of telemedicine applications (MAST) was used for iterative evaluation.
Results
Linkcare® supports ACM with shared-care plans across healthcare tiers and offers integration with provider-specific electronic health records. Linkcare® successfully contributed to the deployment of the four ICS: W&R facilitated long-term sustainability of training effects (,

Several issues, including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, especially for wearables and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches. We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming linear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm, on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only rely on instantaneous sensor array response.

Among various types of harvesting sources such as light, vibration and radio frequency, thermoelectric generators (TEG) are a promising option due to their independence of light conditions or the activity of the wearer. This work investigates scavenging of human body heat and the optimization of the power conversion efficiency from body core to the application. We focus on the critical interaction between thermal harvester and power conditioning circuitry and compare two approaches: (1) a high output voltage, low thermal resistance μTEG combined with a high efficiency actively controlled single inductor DC-DC converter, and (2) a high thermal resistance, low electric resistance mTEG in combination with a low-input voltage coupled inductors based DC-DC converter. The mTEG approach delivers up to 65% higher output power per area in a lab setup and 1–15% in a real-world experiment on the human body depending on physical activity and environmental conditions. Using off-the-shelf and low-cost components, we achieve an average power of 260μW (μTEG) to 280μW (mTEG) and power densities of 13μWcm−2 (μTEG) to 14μWcm−2 (mTEG) for systems worn on the human wrist. With the small and lightweight harvesters optimized for wearability, 16% (mTEG) to 24% (μTEG) of the theoretical maximum efficiency is achieved in a worst-case scenario. This efficiency highly depends on the application specific conditions and requires careful system design. The harvesters can power wearables in different use cases, for example a multi-sensor bracelet that measures activity, acquires images and displays results.",

abstract = "Background
As a new application technology of the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent medical treatment has attracted the attention of both nations and industries through its promotion of medical informatisation, modernisation, and intelligentisation. Faced with a wide variety of intelligent medical terminals, consumers may be affected by various factors when making purchase decisions.
Purpose
To examine and evaluate the key influential factors (and their interrelationships) of consumer adoption behavior for improving and promoting intelligent medical terminals toward achieving set aspiration level in each dimension and criterion.
Method
A hybrid modified Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model was used for this study, based on three components: (1) the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique, to build an influential network relationship map (INRM) at both ‘dimensions’ and ‘criteria’ levels; (2) the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) method, to determine the interrelationships and influential weights among the criteria and identify the source-influential factors; and (3) the modified Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, to evaluate and improve for reducing the performance gaps to meet the consumers’ needs for continuous improvement and sustainable products-development. First, a consensus on the influential factors affecting consumers’ adoption of intelligent medical terminals was collected from experts’ opinion in practical experience. Next, the interrelationships and influential weights of DANP among dimensions/criteria based on the DEMATEL technique were determined. Finally, two intelligent medicine bottles (AdhereTech, A1 alternative; and Audio/Visual Alerting Pillbox, A2 alternative) were reviewed as the terminal devices to verify the accuracy of the MADM model and evaluate its performance on each criterion for improving the total certification gaps by systematics according to the modified VIKOR method based on an INRM.
Results
In this paper, the criteria and dimensions used to improve the evaluation framework are validated. The systematic evaluation in index system is constructed on the basis of five dimensions and corresponding ten criteria. Influential weights of all criteria ranges from 0.037 to 0.152, which shows the rank of criteria importance. The evaluative framework were validated synthetically and scientifically. INRM (influential network relation map) was obtained from experts’ opinion through DEMATEL technique shows complex interrelationship among factors. At the dimension level, the environmental dimension influences other dimensions the most, whereas the security dimension is most influenced by others. So the improvement order of environmental dimension is prior to security dimension. The newly constructed approach was still further validated by the results of the empirical case, where performance gap improvement strategies were analyzed for decision-makers. The modified VIKOR method was especially validated for solving real-world problems in intelligent medical terminal improvement processes. For this paper, A1 performs better than A2, however, promotion mix, brand factor, and market environment are shortcomings faced by both A1 and A2. In addition, A2 should be improved in the wireless network technology, and the objective contact with a high degree of gaps.
Conclusions
Based on the evaluation index system and the integrated model proposed here, decision-makers in enterprises can identify gaps when promoting intelligent medical terminals, from which they can get valuable advice to improve consumer adoption. Additionally, an INRM and the influential weights of DANP can be combined using the modified VIKOR method as integrated weightings to determine how to reduce gaps and provide the best improvement strategies for reaching set aspiration levels.",

Similarly, traditional data processing techniques have several limitations of processing large amount of data. In addition, Big Data analytics requires new and sophisticated algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques to process data in real-time with high accuracy and efficiency. However, recently, research incorporated various deep learning techniques with hybrid learning and training mechanisms of processing data with high speed. Most of these techniques are specific to scenarios and based on vector space thus, shows poor performance in generic scenarios and learning features in big data. In addition, one of the reason of such failure is high involvement of humans to design sophisticated and optimized algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques. In this article, we bring forward an approach of comparing various deep learning techniques for processing huge amount of data with different number of neurons and hidden layers. The comparative study shows that deep learning techniques can be built by introducing a number of methods in combination with supervised and unsupervised training techniques.",

abstract = "Over the last decades, the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has become a critical endeavor to attain different objectives: safety enhancement, mobility improvement, energy optimization and comfort. In order to tackle the first three objectives, a considerable amount of research focusing on autonomous driving have been carried out. Most of these works have been conducted within collaborative research programs involving car manufacturers, OEM and research laboratories around the world. Recent research and development on highly autonomous driving aim to ultimately replace the driver's actions with robotic functions. The first successful steps were dedicated to embedded assistance systems such as speed regulation (ACC), obstacle collision avoidance or mitigation (Automatic Emergency Braking), vehicle stability control (ESC), lane keeping or lane departure avoidance. Partially automated driving will require co-pilot applications (which replace the driver on his all driving tasks) involving a combination of the above methods, algorithms and architectures. Such a system is built with complex, distributed and cooperative architectures requiring strong properties such as reliability and robustness. Such properties must be maintained despite complex and degraded working conditions including adverse weather conditions, fog or dust as perceived by sensors. This paper is an overview on reliability and robustness issues related to sensors processing and perception. Indeed, prior to ensuring a high level of safety in the deployment of autonomous driving applications, it is necessary to guarantee a very high level of quality for the perception mechanisms. Therefore, we will detail these critical perception stages and provide a presentation of usable embedded sensors. Furthermore, in this study of state of the art of recent highly automated systems, some remarks and comments about limits of these systems and potential future research ways will be provided. Moreover, we will also give some advice on how to design a co-pilot application with driver modeling. Finally, we discuss a global architecture for the next generation of co-pilot applications. This architecture is based on the use of recent methods and technologies (AI, Quantify self, IoT …) and takes into account the human factors and driver modeling.",

This vision faces many challenges in terms of integrating technologies, especially RFID-sensor networks (RSNs). In this paper, we introduce a framework for node deployment and delay-tolerance in RSNs under the IoT paradigm. Our framework is comprised of two components. The first is SIWR, a novel Smart Integrated WSNs and RFIDs architecture that classifies nodes into light nodes and super integrated nodes. SIWR employs an optimal linear programming formulation to cost-efficiently place integrated RFID readers. However, integrated IoT architectures face significant connectivity challenges. IoT settings assume no guaranteed contemporaneous end-to-end path between node pairs. To this end, in the second part of our framework, we introduce DIRSN, an optimized delay-tolerant approach for integrated RFID-sensor networks. This is a novel scheme for data routing and courier nodes’ selection in RSNs. DIRSN’s formulation minimizes delay across the network without violating the main dense-deployment and load-balancing requirements. In addition, DIRSN builds on SIWR’s novel architecture to locate the best set of couriers that promise to provide connectivity. Our combined approach is compared to three types of RSN integration architectures and the results show that our architecture and courier selection approaches perform substantially better than other architectures in terms of minimizing delay, cost, packet loss, and in handling extensive traffic demands.",

Wireless sensor network (WSN) is commonly recognized as the core technology of IoT, which has become a hot research area in both academic and industry recently. Because of unreliable and unpredictable behaviors of WSN, intelligent routing selection is crucial to WSN. To provide good quality of service (QoS) guarantee and reduce energy consuming, some routing protocols in WSN consider link-quality estimation on the routing selection. Most of them consider little with the stability of link quality and the weights of varying. This paper proposed a novel routing selection algorithm in WSN, called integrated link quality estimation-based routing protocol (I-LQER). I-LQER firstly analyzed the energy consuming model, added the different weights for the elements in link-quality estimation, and then established a metric for the stability of link quality. I-LQER considered both the link quality and the stability of link quality to support better QoS. For evaluating the performance of I-LQER, we made extensive simulation experiments in network simulator-2 (NS-2). The simulation results show that I-LQER gives better performance in terms of end-to-end delay, scalability and energy consumption, compared with the link quality estimation-based routing (LQER).",

The extensive devices connected through Internet of Things (IoT) bring forth many challenges such as high battery power consumption, designing of smart e-health devices, construction of smart home control system, etc. However, among these challenges, network lifetime in the case of IoT embedded devices communications, battery lifetime of IoT devices, and deployment of sensor networks are the most prominent challenges exist in the current literature. Therefore, to extend the network lifetime and minimum utilization of battery, all the steps from node deployment to network architecture (in our case, we are considering clustered network architecture) and from sensing the environment to sharing the sensed data to the BS (i.e. routing) should be designed in a careful way. Decreasing the broadcasting of packets, and lessening the computation at the node level and minimizing the packet overhead play their important role in the conservation of energy that pushes toward better network throughput. In our under-discussed research work, we are in an aim to increase the network throughput by conserving the energy, especially during the routing process. Our work targets the constituent phases of cluster based aware energy routing for maximizing the throughput by decreasing the end-to-end delay, less packet drop ratio and improving network lifetime. Our strategies of customized, proactive routing, localized behavior strategies and in-network processing help in achieving our goal.",

We design a portable ophthalmoscope, which is composed of a retinal lens, a smartphone and a frame between them to help patients take fundus images anywhere and anytime. Then the images are transmitted to be analyzed, including localization of optic disk and macular, vessel segmentation, detection of lesions, and grading of DR. We use a multi-scale line operator to improve accuracy in segmenting small-scale vessels, a binary mask and image restoration to reduce the effect of the existence of the vessels on optic disk localization. After the analysis, the fundus image are then graded as normal, mild Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), moderate NPDR or severe NPDR. The grading process uses region segmentation to improve the efficiency. The final grading results are tested based on the fundus images provided by the hospitals. We evaluate our system through comparing our grading result with those graded by experts, which comes out with an overall accuracy of up to 85%.",

In departing from the traditional centralized model of manufacturing, decentralized manufacturing divides production across sites or geographic regions. This paradigm shift imposes significant structural and organisational changes on a business presenting both hidden challenges that must be addressed and opportunities to be embraced. By profoundly adapting business practices, significant advantages can be realized through a democratized value chain, creation of professional-level jobs without geographic restriction to the central hub and a flexibility in response to external pressures and demands. To realize these potential opportunities, however, advances in manufacturing technology and support systems are required, as well as significant changes in the way CGTs are regulated to facilitate multi-site manufacturing. Decentralized manufacturing is likely to be the manufacturing platform of choice for advanced health care therapies—in particular, those with a high degree of personalization. The future success of these promising products will be enhanced by adopting sound business strategies early in development. To realize the benefits that decentralized manufacturing of CGTs has to offer, it is important to examine both the risks and the substantial opportunities present. In this research, we examine both the challenges and the opportunities this shift in business strategy represents in an effort to maximize the success of adoption.",

These issues go beyond questions of clinical utility and validity to those of data security, personal identity, race, and the nature of the family.

abstract = "The purpose of winter road maintenance is to reduce the negative effect of snow and ice on traffic. The current literature on winter maintenance practices is split into two segments: means of forecasting weather in order to plan proper winter maintenance, and optimization of maintenance operations. There is relatively little literature on the opportunities that real-time information, e.g., from maintenance vehicles, would offer for combining these two segments and taking the applied research and practice one step further. It seems, however, that the lack of operational solutions has so far limited empirical research in favour of analysing prospects that the ubiquitous technologies could offer for winter maintenance. Recent field tests show that the technical obstacles to obtaining real-time information from maintenance vehicles can be overcome. Thus it is possible to enhance the benefits of winter road maintenance operations considerably through new designs and architectures. Improving the efficiency of vehicle fleets by using real-time information is one of the first realizable steps. Based on the analysis of current winter road maintenance ecosystems in several countries, this paper suggests how to make effective use of the transparency that real-time information exchange between different actors can offer. Transparent real-time information enables re-engineering of the entire winter maintenance ecosystem and assists road authorities in setting more precise, and at the same time more diverse, objectives for winter maintenance. This also involves real-time monitoring of service providers' performance and realization of these objectives.",

Based on the model, parameters of the energy harvesting paver are analyzed to optimize the harvested energy from human walking. The experimental results show that, during typical human walking, the energy harvesting paver can produce an average electrical power of 3.6 W, with a peak value of 12 W. The average harvested energy is 1.8 J per step. The roles of the flywheel and electrical load in changing the amount of harvested energy are discussed. The flywheel’s influence to energy harvesting in walking, fast walking and running conditions are compared and discussed. The energy harvesting paver has potential applications in high-volume pedestrian paths and areas such as sport arenas, airports, railway stations, shopping malls, offices and apartment blocks.",

Food integrity is not only related to the good quality of the food product, nonetheless, it distresses closely more on the health, safety, religious and cultural matters. Weaknesses in handling, monitoring, processing and other factors along the food’s supply chain outbreaks the recent food integrity scandal. These outbreak food integrity scandals could be prevented if clear aspects that affect the food integrity were embraced along the food supply chain. This article is aiming to highlight the factors affecting food integrity in the context of the halal food supply chain and their potential for future research.
Scope and approach
This review attempts to provide a wider view of supply chain management in the halal food industry. Attention is drawn to the literature on other food industries and the results there are put in the context of the halal food setting. In this review, it emphasizes the factors could be monitor or control that contributes to the problem of food integrity.
Key findings and conclusions
Eleven ‘shades’ of food integrity in the halal supply chain are offered, which can be categorized into four supply chain dimensions, related to raw materials, production, service, and the consumer. Each shade is defined and aligned with the results in the literature, and areas for future research are suggested. Theoretical and managerial implications are provided. The ‘shades’ highlighted can be used and considered by managers as fundamental insights to ponder in safeguarding the integrity of halal products.",

The Smartphones are equipped with communication hardware elements like the Bluetooth module, which allows the Smartphone to exchange information with nearby electronic devices. Every day more and more mobile applications are being developed for native platforms that use Bluetooth’s communication module to send and receive information from different sources. Native mobile applications use the specific platform’s APIs to manage the Bluetooth communication actions (send and receive information, search for devices, etc.), however, web applications do not have technical capabilities to manage the Smartphone’s Bluetooth communication module and thereof cannot use that kind of information. The main objective of this research work is to design a novel framework that allows classic web applications to use information from nearby electronic devices. The proposed framework must be easy to use and able to be integrated with common web technologies. Developers can use this framework to include new information sources and data exchange procedures in an easy way. The new type of information can be merged with the web to develop or improve algorithms and web applications.",

Based on this observation, this paper develops strategies to improve “information sustainability” in PLM environments using standardized communication interfaces defined by a recent standard proposal named quantum lifecycle management (QLM) messaging standards. More concretely, data synchronization models based upon QLM standards are developed to enable the synchronization of product-related information among various systems, networks, and organizations involved throughout the product lifecycle.

Mobile e-health applications provide users and healthcare practitioners with an insightful way to check users/patients’ status and monitor their daily activities. This paper proposes a cloud-based mobile e-health calorie system that can classify food objects in the plate and further compute the overall calorie of each food object with high accuracy. The novelty in our system is that we are not only offloading heavy computational functions of the system to the cloud, but also employing an intelligent cloud-broker mechanism to strategically and efficiently utilize cloud instances to provide accurate and improved time response results. The broker system uses a dynamic cloud allocation mechanism that takes decisions on allocating and de-allocating cloud instances in real-time for ensuring the average response time stays within a predefined threshold. In this paper, we further demonstrate various scenarios to explain the workflow of the cloud components including: segmentation, deep learning, indexing food images, decision making algorithms, calorie computation, scheduling management as part of the proposed cloud broker model. The implementation results of our system showed that the proposed cloud broker results in a 45% gain in the overall time taken to process the images in the cloud. With the use of dynamic cloud allocation mechanism, we were able to reduce the average time consumption by 77.21% when 60 images were processed in parallel.",

Plants not only constitute green space useful to contrast urban pollution effects or provide ecosystemic benefits to residents but they can also be used as bioindicators and their involvement in communication networks can represent a significant contribution to build a smart, green city. The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) envisages that objects that surround us will be connected and there are no reasons to exclude urban trees from among the “wired object”. Radio frequency identification devices (RFID) may represent a prerequisite of IoT application and they can be used for tree protection and management, thanks to tagging experience carried out on various plant species. RFID tags can be easily associated with plants, externally or internally. This latter approach is particularly indicated if the identification of trees needs to be secured since its production, eliminating the risk of tag losses or removal. Interesting applications may be derived by implementing RFID tags in biomonitoring systems in order to guarantee a real-time data communication in which tags may act as antennas for multifunctional green spaces. Moreover, the virtualization of green areas using sensors and mobile devices can lead to the desktop management of the urban green with the possibility of implementing a real-time navigation throughout the areas. A complex relational network in which data can be collected thanks to geospatial methods can be integrated by an IoT approach in which RFID-plants can play a significant role.",

The challenge is that reaching these goals requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system.

IoT promises to connect all physical “things” via a dynamic global network infrastructure and create intelligent behaviors in different contexts without human manipulations. In line with this development, the number of IoT solutions also have augmented exponentially covering many domains from health care, urban management to life quality improvement and so forth. However, separate appearances of these solutions today has led to barriers in enlarging smart environments because they lack a mechanism for integration. It is well-known that in the very near future, IoT requires the capabilities of high scale and dynamic adaptation with linking many new and existing smart contexts together. Hence, the need of having a comprehensive management method for the large-scale IoT environments is urgent at the time. In this paper, we focus on designing an overlay management architecture based on Chord algorithm to manage things in heterogeneous space. The architecture is a collection of multiple peer Chord rings, and thus each of these rings is considered as a smart context. We also bring forward operation mechanisms for the architecture such as thing identification, key insert/remove, key lookup and node joining/leave. Our proposed architecture is simulated and evaluated with diverse properties. The gained results showed the feasibility of our approach in reality meeting scalability, robustness and maintainability requirements applying to manage and control cyber-physical systems.",

abstract = "Building Information Modelling, new paradigm of digital design and management, shows great potential for the refurbishment process, as it represents a possible way out of criticalities that occur in documentation and preservation of existing assets, if connected to cognitive automation. The combination of BIM with automation systems improves the quality control during diagnosis, design and work execution, and the labour savings, which is particularly relevant for rapid intervention in case of hazardous conditions. Therefore, the paper is going to address a methodological discussion concerning complete “as-built” parametric models of historical buildings, supporting the design of refurbishment and conservation interventions. Although some reviews of the state of the art exist on the topic of Historic Building Information Modelling, the present research introduces a different perspective on HBIM modelling, with diagnosis and performance assessment as key-aspects, in terms of automating performance assessment. Specifically, from the data collection of contributions regarding HBIM/BIM, diagnostics and monitoring on existing buildings and infrastructures, a critical review by selected criteria is developed. Nevertheless, general methods and tools for information management and exchange tasks in BIM are briefly described as well, since they are considered useful for future developments of HBIM approach. The core of the critical analysis is focused on the scientific and technical relations among HBIM models, diagnosis and performance assessment features. In addition, the review identifies specific activities and relative tools and methods for knowledge acquisition and semantic enrichment. Finally, gaps in knowledge of the current literature are outlined and discussed, with specific focus on performance assessment in HBIM. In this regard, a new methodology toward Diagnosis-Aided Historic Building Information Modelling and Management (DA-HBIMM) is proposed as a framework to be developed in order to address smart knowledge acquisition, collection and notification of assessed performances and eventual risks, by cognitive automation and artificial intelligence, in the near future.",

This paper reports on data from an embedded qualitative study which ran alongside a randomised controlled trial in England designed to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of a self-care support policy which found no statistically significant reductions in health service utilisation. Drawing on concepts from the sociology of chronic illness, analyses suggest that the biographical and social context relevant to individuals’ experience of living with a long-term condition, history of health service utilisation, and relationships with health professionals are relevant to understanding the impact of self-management education and related policies aimed at bringing about changes in service use. Our study suggests that future health policy assumptions about utilisation in the context of chronic disease management and self-care support polices may benefit by acknowledging the complex, contextual and recursive nature of health service utilisation operating in the life worlds of patients’ experience of living with a long-term condition.",

DDS has been applied for the development of high performance distributed systems such as in the defense, finance, automotive, and simulation domains. To support the analysis and design of a DDS-based distributed system, the OMG has proposed the DDS UML Profile. A DDS-based system usually consists of multiple participant applications each of which has different responsibilities in the system. These participants can be allocated in different ways to the available resources, which leads to different configuration alternatives. Usually, each configuration alternative will perform differently with respect to the execution and communication cost of the overall system. In general, the deployment configuration is selected manually based on expert knowledge. This approach is suitable for small to medium scale applications but for larger applications this is not tractable. In this paper, we provide a systematic approach for deriving feasible deployment alternatives based on the application design and the available physical resources. The application design includes the design for DDS topics, publishers and subscribers. For supporting the application design, we propose a DDS UML profile. Based on the application design and the physical resources, the feasible deployment alternatives can be algorithmically derived and automatically generated using the developed tools. We illustrate the approach for deriving feasible deployment alternatives of smart city parking system.",

Mobile health or mHealth research has been growing exponentially in recent years. However, the research on mHealth has been ad-hoc and selective without a clear definition of the mHealth domain. Without a roadmap for research we may not realize the full potential of mHealth. In this paper, we present an ontological framework to define the mHealth domain and illuminate a roadmap.
Methods
We present an ontology of mHealth. The ontology is developed by systematically deconstructing the domain into its primary dimensions and elements. We map the extent research on mHealth in 2014 onto the ontology and highlight the bright, light, and blind/blank spots which represent the emphasis of mHealth research.
Findings
The emphases of mHealth research in 2014 are very uneven. There are a few bright spots and many light spots. The research predominantly focuses on individuals’ use of mobile devices and applications to capture or obtain health-related data mostly to improve quality of care through mobile intervention.
Conclusions
We argue that the emphases can be balanced in the roadmap for mHealth research. The ontological mapping plays an integral role in developing and maintaining the roadmap which can be updated periodically to continuously assess and guide mHealth research.",

A POCT development roadmap emerged to guide multidisciplinary teams of biomarker scientists, technologists, health care providers, and clinical trialists as they: 1) formulate needs assessments; 2) define device design specifications; 3) develop component technologies and integrated systems; 4) perform iterative pilot testing; and 5) conduct rigorous prospective clinical testing to ensure that POCT solutions have substantial effects on cardiovascular care.",

This paper explores the use of ElectroCardioGram (ECG) records to encrypt user data. Previous attempts have shown that ECG can be taken as a basis for key generation. However, these approaches do not consider time-invariant keys. This feature enables using these so-created keys for symmetrically encrypting data (e.g. smartphone pictures), enabling their decryption using the key derived from the current ECG readings. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing EbH, a mechanism for persistent key generation based on ECG. EbH produces seeds from which encryption keys are generated. Experimental results over 24 h for 199 users show that EbH, under certain settings, can produce permanent seeds (thus time-invariant keys) computed on-the-fly and different for each user—up to 95.97% of users produce unique keys. In addition, EbH can be tuned to produce seeds of different length (up to 300 bits) and with variable min-entropy (up to 93.51). All this supports the workability of EbH in a real setting.",

Medical community needs to extract precise information from that large amount of data. Currently ICT approaches do not provide a methodology for content-based medical images retrieval and classification. On the other hand, from the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, the ICT medical data can be produced by several devices. Produced data complies with all Big Data features and constraints. The IoT guidelines put at the center of the system a new smart software to manage and transform Big Data in a new understanding form. This paper describes a text based indexing system for mammographic images retrieval and classification. The system deals with text (structured reports) and images (mammograms) mining and classification in a typical Department of Radiology. DICOM structured reports, containing free text for medical diagnosis, have been analyzed and labeled in order to classify the corresponding mammographic images. Information Retrieval process is based on some text manipulation techniques, such as light semantic analysis, stop-word removing, and light medical natural language processing. The system includes also a Search Engine module, based on a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of Specificity and Sensibility. Two more indexes have been computed in order to assess the system robustness: the Az (Area under ROC Curve) index and the σAz (Az standard error) index. The dataset is composed of healthy and pathological DICOM structured reports. Two use case scenarios are presented and described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Wireless sensor network (WSN) as a key enabling technology in IoT offers the potential for cities to get smarter.

One of the most exciting applications of WSNs in smart cities is detection, monitoring, and tracking which is referred to as object tracking sensor networks (OTSN). The adaptation of OTSN into urban cities brought new exciting challenges for reaching the goal of future smart cities. Such challenges focus primarily on problems related to active monitoring and tracking in smart cities. In this paper, we present the essential characteristics of OTSN, monitoring and tracking application used with the content of smart city. Moreover, we discussed the taxonomy of OTSN along with analysis and comparison. Furthermore, research challenges are investigated concerning energy reservation, object detection, object speed, accuracy in tracking, sensor node collaboration, data aggregation and object recovery position estimation. This review can serve as a benchmark for researchers for future development of smart cities in the context of OTSN. Lastly, we provide future research direction.",

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.",

As a consequence, they are often unable to run current standard Internet protocols, requiring special, optimized protocols. A number of these protocols, covering the different layers of the protocol stack, have been developed and standardized lately. At the application level, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is proposed by the IETF as an HTTP replacement that is suitable for constrained devices. CoAP is a very light-weight base protocol that can be extended with optional specifications to satisfy specific use case needs. Two important optional specifications are observe, allowing monitoring of a CoAP resource over a period of time, and group communication, supporting interactions with multiple CoAP devices at once. Currently, these two optional specifications do not work together, i.e., it is not possible to gain the benefits of both of them at the same time. In this paper we present an alternative and novel approach to CoAP group communication that works well with the CoAP observe extension. In addition, it enables to perform operations on the observed results, bringing intelligence closer to the data sources.",

abstract = "Healthcare industry is one of the areas where wireless sensor network provides a lot of opportunities. Online data sharing in healthcare industry not only increases the efficiency but also reduces the time constraints. In the healthcare wireless sensor network, patient’s report is available online for health professionals without any delay after patient’s checkup. Data privacy becomes an important issue in healthcare industry due to direct involvement of personal health related data of patients. Modified data may become a serious cause of casualty for patient. Digital signature scheme is a technique of public key cryptography that is widely accepted in digital world to retain privacy and integrity. Certificateless public key cryptography was proposed to remove the complication of certificate management in public key cryptography as well as the key escrow problem inherited in identity based cryptography. An aggregate signature scheme is a many to one map which maps different signatures on different messages to a single signature. This feature is very beneficial in an environment which is constrained by limited bandwidth and low computational time/effort, such as wireless sensor network, vehicular ad-hoc network and Internet of things. Our proposed certificateless aggregate signature enjoys the goodness of both the concepts, certificateless and aggregate. We construct a certificateless aggregate signature scheme and prove the security of constructed scheme by using widely-accepted Random Oracle Model under the computationally hard Diffie-Hellman assumption. Random Oracle Model based security analysis proves that our proposed scheme is provably secure against existential forgery on adaptive chosen message and identity attacks under the hardness of computational Diffie-Hellman problem and achieves the required goals such as confidentiality, non-repudiation and integrity. We use batch verification technique for speedy verification of signatures. Since energy consumption for aggregate signature verification in our scheme is lesser than that in many of the related schemes, the proposed CL-AS scheme is compatible with the resource scanty nature of wireless sensor networks. Thus the proposed CL-AS scheme is efficient and suitable for green healthcare wireless sensor networks (HWSNs).",

This study provides a definition for urban big data while exploring its features and applications of China's city intelligence. The differences between city intelligence in China and the “smart city” concept in other countries are compared to highlight and contrast the unique definition and model for China's city intelligence in this paper. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of urban big data in city intelligence by showing that it not only serves as the cornerstone of this trend as it also plays a core role in the diffusion of city intelligence technology and serves as an inexhaustible resource for the sustained development of city intelligence. This study also points out the challenges of shaping and developing of China's urban big data. Considering the supporting and core role that urban big data plays in city intelligence, the study then expounds on the key points of urban big data, including infrastructure support, urban governance, public services, and economic and industrial development. Finally, this study points out that the utility of city intelligence as an ideal policy tool for advancing the goals of China's urban development. In conclusion, it is imperative that China make full use of its unique advantages—including using the nation's current state of development and resources, geographical advantages, and good human relations—in subjective and objective conditions to promote the development of city intelligence through the proper application of urban big data.",

This study combined the binocular stereo vision system with the LabVIEW development platform to analyze and estimate body size and live body weight using 10 landrace aged from 14 to 25 weeks old at the end under indoor farm condition. The experimental facility was composed of data collection system, image acquisition system, and image analysis system. Data collection system including binocular camera and specially designed limitation fence was used to ensure the pig’s ID recognition and image acquisition were implemented automatically. The images were acquired, saved, and processed by the other two systems to analysis the relationship between body weight and body size. Images acquired by binocular cameras were segmented by the depth threshold. The system verified that the body length (BL) and withers height (WH) were estimated with the R2 ranged from 0.91 to 0.98. The back area and the body weight data obtained by a ground scale were fitted into linear model. According to the result of regression by least square method, the parameters of the function were calculated. Results revealed that live body weight was closely related to the sum of pixel values (SPV) which was calculated from the reconstructed image. Coefficient of determination R2 value was as high as 0.9931. It meant this procedure performed well in predicting live weight. The whole automatic systems have the potential to be applied in the real farm environment.",

The measurement method is improved based on the Lambert–Beer Law. Also, we compensate the initial absorbance because of the light absorbance of the sensor at different wavelengths. The influence of the temperature change is analyzed on the measurement. All of these methods make the end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure accurate and convenient.",

Performance, however, may also be assessed in terms of the fraction of events which may successfully/unsuccessfully be detected and reported within a time interval of interest, i.e., mission time. Such a performance metric, here termed event goodput, is key for all random event-driven networks, ranging from surveillance and intrusion detection applications operating in time critical scenarios, to mobile and wearable crowd-sensed ecosystems, where mobile sensors are utilized by a number of different applications. When reporting the appearance of a series of possible, but unknown, phenomena, predicting which event goodput may be obtained during the planned mission time is challenging. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the network-wide problem to the analysis of the performance of individual nodes, in terms of their capability of handling given fractions of event arrivals under fixed probabilistic guarantees. This is obtained as a function of mission time, event arrival and energy consumption models of different, detection and communication schemes, all realistic.",

abstract = "There is an active contemporary debate about how emerging technologies such as automated vehicles, peer-to-peer sharing applications and the ‘internet of things’ will revolutionise individual and collective mobility. Indeed, it is argued that the so-called ‘Smart Mobility’ transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed – will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.",

As SMEs play an essential role in industrial value creation, the article examines significant, yet at present understudied implications of Industry 4.0 along industrial value chains. First, the results show that Industry 4.0 encompasses three dimensions, namely high-grade digitization of processes, smart manufacturing, and inter-company connectivity. Second, the article shows how Industry 4.0 affects the three business model elements of manufacturing SMEs – value creation, value capture, and value offer – by giving specific examples for business model innovation in each of the three elements. Third, it shows that both the role as a user and/or provider of Industry 4.0 and whether a company is internally motivated and/or externally pressured towards implementation have an impact on which business model elements are innovated. Fourth, the study delineates four SME categories, designed to help managers to evaluate their own company's positioning towards Industry 4.0: craft manufacturers, preliminary stage planners, Industry 4.0 users, and full-scale adopters.

Plants are sessile organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation, and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems) of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication aspects of the WSN's, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured. The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access, and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.",

While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.",

abstract = "A passive contactless sensor is presented for monitoring resistivity in porous materials. Electrical resistivity (ER) is an important indicator of water and ion content in porous materials, especially man-made and natural composites such as concrete and soil. The ER sensor is small, battery-free and is energised and queried wirelessly for data by a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader or a near-field communication (NFC) enabled mobile device (a tablet or Smartphone). By applying Topsøe coefficients and a calibration function to the sensor output, the ER of the material is reliably estimated. Experimental results in the laboratory with a model aggregate material (sand) wetted with sodium chloride solutions demonstrate excellent agreement between the new sensor and a standard laboratory conductivity meter. Embedded ER sensors can provide long-term and repeatable data from soil, concrete and similar porous materials where ER is an accepted proxy for water and ion content. We think that passive contactless resistivity sensors will become commonplace as the Internet of Things (IoT) develops in the construction and precision agriculture sectors, and as the demand for long-lived, battery-free sensors increases.",

While surprisingly large numbers of people unthinkingly renounce such of their privacy as remains for trifles, the idealistic hopes of early pioneers and freedom-loving ‘netizens’ remain largely unfulfilled. Benign notions such as 'cyber democracy' and the ‘information superhighway’ have all but disappeared. In place of these optimistic hopes and projections there's a growing sense of uncertainty, disillusion and, in some cases, fear. Those driving various components of the IT revolution claim new benefits and highlight examples of successful implementation - email, tablets, health innovations and so on. Yet, despite these obvious successes, it's hard to avoid the fact that many IT practices are powerfully disposed in favour of the interests of corporations, innovators and entrepreneurs. This enquiry takes the form of three separate but interrelated papers and has two main purposes. The first paper seeks to account for the underlying polarity between the promoters of high-tech 'solutions' and those who view the world differently. Drawing on a sample of literature including informed journalism it begins by outlining key assumptions (including that technology is 'not merely stuff” and 'new technologies are ambiguous'). It then outlines aspects of the territory through a critical review several key works. Some general conclusions provide starting points for the second and third articles.",

The Court failed to adequately address this question, leaving Australians unsure as to whether sections of their information, such as the IP addresses allocated to their mobile devices, will be considered personal information under the Act. The main consideration the Court dealt with was what it means for information to be “about” an individual. In this paper I address two questions: a) how is information determined to be “about” an individual under the Act; and b) how should this determination be made in the future? I conclude that currently available guidance from the courts, the Australian Information Commissioner and scholarly commentary are inadequate to enable individuals, organisations and agencies to consistently make such determinations. Accordingly I draw on approaches to this question taken in Canada, New Zealand, the European Union and the United Kingdom to argue that the definition should be broadly interpreted in a technologically-aware manner. This will help to ensure that personal information is more comprehensively protected under the Privacy Act.",

This study aims to investigate whether PPPs access in a hospital environment violates patient privacy. If so, to what extent can we manage patient privacy while accessing PPPs in this environment? We investigated this question by analyzing questionnaire-based data from two Asian countries: Group A (China) and Group B (Pakistan). For data collection, we targeted those medical entities which were directly dealing with PPPs in their routine tasks. Results suggest that patient type directly influences the collection of PPPs: Group A (one-time = 1.9, follow-up = 1.06) and Group B (one-time = 2.0 and follow-up = 1.9). Both groups agreed that patients have the right to control their own PPPs. In both, doctors are the most trusted entity: for Group A, the Pearson Chi-Square with one degree of freedom is 1.414, p = 0.234, whereas for Group B, the Pearson Chi-Square with three degrees of freedom is 4.511, p = 0.11. Most of the Group A entities (92%) are familiar with unauthorized access of PPPs, while in Group B the level was only 35%. In Group B, only 35% of entities stated the purpose, specification and use limitations of PPPs. Doctors in both groups showed a high utilization of PPPs read authorization rights. This empirical evidence about PPPs usage in both countries will benefit health technology and improve policy on patient privacy.",

This use of networked technology has advantages for security as well, enabling feeds from security controls to be fed into the central management system so that anomalies in traffic flows can be seen and remedial action taken in an efficient, automated manner, as Colin Tankard of Digital Pathways explains.",

While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. The main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration. In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.",

A novel classifier or predicator equipped with a good feature selection function contributes effectively to classification and prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel bagging C4.5 algorithm based on wrapper feature selection, for the purpose of supporting wise clinical decision-making in the medical and healthcare fields. In particular, the new proposed sampling method, S-C4.5-SMOTE, is not only able to overcome the problem of data distortion, but also improves overall system performance because its mechanism aims at effectively reducing the data size without distortion, by keeping datasets balanced and technically smooth. This achievement directly supports the Wrapper method of effective feature selection without the need to consider the problem of huge amounts of data; this is a novel innovation in this work.",

abstract = "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common cardiovascular disorder. It affects people of both genders at ages as young as 20 years. The increased number of VTE cases with a high fatality rate of 25% at first occurrence makes preventive measures essential. Clinical narratives are a rich source of knowledge and should be included in the diagnosis and treatment processes, as they may contain critical information on risk factors. It is very important to make such narrative blocks of information usable for searching, health analytics, and decision-making. This paper proposes a Semantic Extraction and Sentiment Assessment of Risk Factors (SESARF) framework. Unlike traditional machine-learning approaches, SESARF, which consists of two main algorithms, namely, ExtractRiskFactor and FindSeverity, prepares a feature vector as the input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to make a diagnosis. SESARF matches and maps the concepts of VTE risk factors and finds adjectives and adverbs that reflect their levels of severity. SESARF uses a semantic- and sentiment-based approach to analyze clinical narratives of electronic health records (EHR) and then predict a diagnosis of VTE. We use a dataset of 150 clinical narratives, 80% of which are used to train our prediction classifier support vector machine, with the remaining 20% used for testing. Semantic extraction and sentiment analysis results yielded precisions of 81% and 70%, respectively. Using a support vector machine, prediction of patients with VTE yielded precision and recall values of 54.5% and 85.7%, respectively.",

abstract = "This article discusses the potential to transfer big data algorithms developed for ‘predictive policing’ to the field of corporate sustainability. To do so the paper starts with the thought experiment asking if major corporate scandals with disastrous environmental (BP Oil spill) or social (Rana Plaza building collapse) consequences, or global warming and floods could be prevented if big data driven predictive algorithms were in place. The article reviews first efforts to utilize big data for promoting sustainability and for reducing harm. By analogy the concept of ‘predictive policing’ is identified to be transferred to a concept called “Predictive Sustainability Control”. A systematic literature review on predictive policing is conducted. In a next step all parameters, characteristics, functional areas and processes, as well as legal and ethical issues of predictive policing were clustered and presented. Subsequently the concept is developed out of the clustered themes and criteria (Table 1) and a definition is provided: Predictive Sustainability Control is the use of analytical techniques to identify subjects for mutual deliberation, supervision and intervention with the goal of preventing future harm related to environmental, social and governance issues, solving past scandals, and identifying potential actors/corporations of unsustainable activities and their stakeholders in the near future. Furthermore three functional areas (sustainability management, stakeholder partnership and regulatory integration) are defined and the concept is operationalized in a big data driven environment (Fig. 1). In the operationalization the concept of a digital ‘planetary nervous system’ is proposed and eXtensible Business Reporting Language data repositories used in corporate data management and Corporate Social Responsibility reporting were integrated to arrive at a data set, where predictive analytics could be applied to prevent future harm and reduce current unsustainability. In conclusion the question of governance, data protection and privacy is discussed critically and future research avenues for theory advancement and empirical testing are presented. In closing limitations of legality and functionality are discussed. The overall scientific value can be seen in the potential, which big data and algorithms have also for promoting and enforcing sustainable development based on rigorous data management leading to the predictive identification of likely unsustainable events.",

Generally, in the public cloud, fog computing comprises three components: terminal device, fog node and public cloud server (PCS). In this paper, we propose the concept of anonymous and secure aggregation scheme (ASAS) in fog-based public cloud computing. In the ASAS model, a fog node aggregates the data from terminal nodes and forwards the aggregated data to the public cloud server. By using the ASAS scheme, the fog node can help terminal devices upload their data to PCS. By using the data aggregation technique, our ASAS scheme can save bandwidth between the fog node and PCS. At the same time, our ASAS scheme not only protects the identities of terminal devices by using pseudonyms but it also guarantees data secrecy via a homomorphic encryption technique. In this paper, we design the first concrete ASAS scheme. We also examine the security and the performance of our proposal, which we show to be provably secure and efficient.",

In recent years, the literature associated with healthcare big data has grown rapidly, but few studies have used bibliometrics and a visualization approach to conduct deep mining and reveal a panorama of the healthcare big data field.
Methods
To explore the foundational knowledge and research hotspots of big data research in the field of healthcare informatics, this study conducted a series of bibliometric analyses on the related literature, including papers’ production trends in the field and the trend of each paper’s co-author number, the distribution of core institutions and countries, the core literature distribution, the related information of prolific authors and innovation paths in the field, a keyword co-occurrence analysis, and research hotspots and trends for the future.
Results
By conducting a literature content analysis and structure analysis, we found the following: (a) In the early stage, researchers from the United States, the People’s Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany made the most contributions to the literature associated with healthcare big data research and the innovation path in this field. (b) The innovation path in healthcare big data consists of three stages: the disease early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis phase, the life and health promotion phase, and the nursing phase. (c) Research hotspots are mainly concentrated in three dimensions: the disease dimension (e.g., epidemiology, breast cancer, obesity, and diabetes), the technical dimension (e.g., data mining and machine learning), and the health service dimension (e.g., customized service and elderly nursing).
Conclusion
This study will provide scholars in the healthcare informatics community with panoramic knowledge of healthcare big data research, as well as research hotspots and future research directions.",

Context refers to the particular settings that give additional information on the reasons behind the set of data that is obtained and its value to the end user. Context is often derived through inferences and reasoning techniques, the aim being disambiguation, reducing doubts, and improve confidence levels. In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare. The context broker that is presented in this paper addresses some critical healthcare issues: availability, cost and quality. This broker is for general and specialised healthcare needs in specific medical fields, and it is especially useful in emergency situations. It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria. The context broker collects queries from users (patients or their dependents), and refers them to the best and most affordable hospitals on the basis of their geographical location, financial status, quality of care and the availability of the requested medical services at the time their request is made.",

Fog computing implements the idea of extending the cloud where the ”things” are, or in other words, improving application performance and resource efficiency by removing the need to processing all the information in the cloud, thus also reducing bandwidth consumption in the network. Fog computing is designed to complement cloud computing, paving the way for a novel, enriched architecture that can benefit from and include both edge(fog) and cloud resources. From a resources perspective, this combined scenario requires resource continuity when executing a service, whereby the assumption is that the selection of resources for service execution remains independent of their physical location. This new resources model, i.e., resource continuity, has gained recently significant attention, as it carries potential to seamlessly providing a computing infrastructure from the edge to the cloud, with an improved performance and resource efficiency. In this paper, we study the main architectural features of the managed resource continuity, proposing the foundation of a coordinated management plane responsible for resource continuity provisioning. We study an illustrative example on the performance benefits in relationship to the size of databases with regard to the proposed architectural model.",

An efficient mobility support protocol provides a continuous seamless connectivity for mobile nodes with constrained resources essentially in terms of energy and link capacity. The existing routing protocol RPL has a very low reactivity to mobility making it inefficient and open to further research improvements. In this paper, we propose a new proactive mobility support protocol named EKF-MRPL based on the Extended Kalman Filter and the RPL standard. The crux of this protocol consists in providing mobile nodes with a seamless connectivity while reducing the number of switching between attachment points to reduce the signaling overhead as well as the power consumption. In the quest to forecast the new point of attachment of a mobile node, we propose to predict its non-linear trajectory based on the Extended Kalman Filter. We set up an analytical model and conducted extensive simulations using the Contiki platform. Simulation results clearly show that our proposed protocol EKF-MRPL outperforms several recent proposals, in particular the EC-MRPL in terms of signaling cost, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and handover delay.",

The development of the Virtual Patient will change conventional medicine, which has been based upon experience and expectation, into “predictive medicine” that will have the capacity to develop solutions based upon prior understanding of the dynamic mechanisms and the quantitative logic of human physiology. Drug discovery, medical and welfare apparatus, and clinical trials in silico will improve the development of products with higher efficiency, reliability and safety while reducing cost. They will also impact upon knowledge-intensive industries. Such program aims at playing a key role in this new area, by sharing and generating solutions as well as human resources contributing to establishment of “in silico medicine” as a basis of the predictive medicine within an international framework. In the long-term, computational physiological models will be refined, linked and validated until they are capable of providing essential predictions to clinicians when healthcare decisions need to be made. As the amount of data reinforcing the models grows, predictions will become more and more patient-centred, with models migrating from statistical, average models to physiological and mechanistic models informed by the unique characteristics of the patient. Systems Patientomics will propose new ways of combining this rich patient information space in a highly visual, coherent, meaningful way and of generating new clinical information by blending and fusing existing information, ultimately creating a “Patient Avatar” capable of supporting the medical professional by producing new clinical knowledge emerging from the integration of patient- and population-specific information.

abstract = "In many countries across the world a universal issue of growing concern is increasing demand for health services and corresponding escalating costs. While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.",

How can one handle the increasing complexity? Can one guarantee safety and performance of such networked control systems subject to erroneous communication, delays, and failures of sensors and actuators? Is it possible to design control systems with plug and play capacity? How can one guarantee privacy of the controlled subsystems while exchanging information? Predictive control is a well suited control approach to tackle some of these challenges, since its allows to directly take constraints, preview information, as well as models of the physical world into account.We limit our attention to three areas we believe predictive control methods can have a significant impact: the efficient and easy implementation of predictive control on the omnipresent embedded computation hardware, the control under resource limitations and network effects, and the control on the network level, outlining a contract based control approach which allows a structured, yet flexible hierarchical design.We briefly review results from these fields and outline some solutions related to our work, that provide possible solutions to the considered challenges.",

Social media has revolutionized our societies. It has made fundamental impact on the way we work and live. More importantly, social media is gradually becoming a key pulse of smart societies by sensing the information about the people and their spatio-temporal experiences around the living spaces. Big data and computational intelligence technologies are helping us to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by the social media, such as twitter, and make informed decisions about us and the living spaces. This paper reports our preliminary work on the use of social media for the detection of spatio-temporal events related to logistics and planning. Specifically, we use big data and AI platforms including Hadoop, Spark, and Tableau, to study twitter data about London. Moreover, we use the Google Maps Geocoding API to locate the tweeters and make additional analysis. We find and locate congestion around the London city. We also discover that, during a certain period, top third tweeted words were about job and hiring, leading us to locate the source of the tweets which happened to be originating from around the Canary Wharf area, UK's major financial center. The results presented in the paper have been obtained using 500,000 tweets.",

This paper proposes a systematic development method for CPMT. Generic system architecture is developed to provide guidelines for advancing existing Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools to CPMT. The proposed architecture allows machine tool, machining processes, real-time machining data and intelligent algorithms to be deeply integrated through various types of networks. The development methodologies for the core of the CPMT, the Machine Tool Cyber Twin (MTCT), are studied and discussed in detail. MTCT enables different types of feedback loops among the physical world, the cyber space and humans to be realized. An MTConnect-based CPMT prototype is developed to validate the proposed CPMT. Experimental results have proved great interoperability, connectivity and extensibility of the proposed CPMT. The potential of implementing artificial intelligence in CPMT is also discussed.",

As automated vehicle (AV) technologies advance and emerge within a ubiquitous cyber-physical world they raise additional issues that have not yet been adequately defined, let alone researched. Issues around automation, sociotechnical complexity and systems resilience are well known in the context of aviation and space. There are important lessons that could be drawn from these applications to help inform the development of automated driving. This paper argues that for the foreseeable future, regardless of the level of automation, a driver will continue to have a role.

abstract = "Background and objective
Elderly populations are more prone to diseases and need continuous monitoring of parameters to ensure good health. Wearable devices (WDs) can be helpful in the early detection and management of medical conditions. However, less is known about the use of currently available WDs among elderly populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the usefulness and actual use of wearable devices among the elderly population.
Methods
Our methodology was based on a systematic review and a survey questionnaire. In the systematic review, search was conducted in four databases PubMed, MDPI, Sage, and Scopus with search terms “wearable device” and “elderly”, “wearable sensor” and “elderly”. The inclusion criteria were the studies which described health-related wearable devices, its use as the outcome, conducted on a minimum of ten participants and published in the last five years. The survey was conducted on the MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) platform. The questionnaire was related to the use of technology, intention to use, security and privacy concerns, and willingness to pay.
Results
The review identified 4915 articles, of which, 31 studies eventually met the inclusion criteria. All studies reported positive impacts after assessing devices, despite certain drawbacks. The majority of the samples were males. The survey revealed responses from 233 individuals out of the 1100 participants of the course. The survey results were categorized into two age groups: 54.3% were elderly (>65 years) and 45.49% were non-elderly (≤65 years). Very few elderly people were currently using WD. More than 60% of elderly people were interested in the future use of wearable devices, and preferred future use to improve physical and mental activities. A majority of the respondents were female.
Conclusions
This study suggests awareness should be created among elderly populations regarding the use of WDs for the early detection and prevention of complications and emergencies. Elderly populations are more prone to benefits from using WDs. The review concluded that devices should be tested on elderly groups as well, considering sex equality, and on both healthy and sick participants for better insights. The survey determined the elderly as frequent users of technology, but lack of knowledge of WD and demonstrated female interest in the use of WD. In future research on WDs, it is suggested that clinical studies be conducted for longer durations, and standard protocols such as age and sex equality should be considered. Requirements from both users and physicians should be acknowledged for better cognizance of WDs.",

We provide a comprehensive survey of computational intelligence techniques appropriate for the effective processing and analysis of big data. We discuss a number of exemplar application areas that generate big data and can hence benefit from its effective processing. State of the art research and novel applications in health-care, intelligent transportation and social network sentiment analysis, are presented and discussed in the context of Big data, Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS), and Computational Intelligence (CI). We present a data modelling methodology, which introduces a novel biologically inspired universal generative modelling approach called Hierarchical Spatial–Temporal State Machine (HSTSM). The HSTSM modelling approach incorporates a number of soft computing techniques such as: deep belief networks, auto-encoders, agglomerative hierarchical clustering and temporal sequence processing, in order to address the computational challenges arising from analysing and processing large volumes of diverse data to provide an effective big data analytics tool for diverse application areas. A conceptual cyber–physical architecture, which can accommodate and benefit from the proposed methodology, is further presented.",

This question is important because of the protection given to data in law and ethics. Healthcare data are universally considered sensitive (and confidential), so it might seem that the categorisation of less sensitive data is relatively unimportant for medical data research. This paper will explore the arguments that this is not necessarily the case and the relevance of recognizing this. The categorization of data and information requires re-evaluation in the age of Big Data in order to ensure that the appropriate protections are given to different types of data. The aggregation of large amounts of data requires an assessment of the harms and benefits that pertain to large datasets linked together, rather than simply assessing each datum or dataset in isolation. Big Data produce new data via inferences, and this must be recognized in ethical assessments. We propose a schema for a granular assessment of data categories. The use of schemata such as this will assist decision-making by providing research ethics committees and information governance bodies with guidance about the relative sensitivities of data. This will ensure that appropriate and proportionate safeguards are provided for data research subjects and reduce inconsistency in decision making.",

Smart societies require next generation mobility platforms and applications to enable the needed quality and pace of life. This paper proposes a mobile computing system that enables smarter cities with enhanced mobility information through big data technologies, fogs and clouds. The system includes a mobile application, a backend cloud-based big data analysis system, and a middleware platform based on fog computing. The system architecture and its component technologies are described in addition to a mobile application use case. The technologies used in this paper have been used in the literature in the past. However, we have not found any work where all these technologies have been brought together to develop a mobile application that provides uniquely focused information on user mobility. Google Maps notifications could provide information about nearby road closure or other events where relevant. However, we propose to pull in and provide information to the users about their travel locally, nationally, and internationally. More importantly, relevant information is pulled in from multiple news media and other sources and provided to the user in multimedia formats including text, voice and video.",

Various system designs are presented, i.e. single vs multi-sensor systems, and a set of sensors either localized or distributed across the body. The probability of positive fever identification on feverish children ranges from ∼40% to 77% using 1 and 5 sensors respectively, while the detected false positives are a 10%. We conclude that a continuous and non-invasive fever monitoring in children under 2years is possible by the propose method, providing a suitable solution for early fever detection and alert.",

In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices. ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.",

Therefore, the software development process has been analyzed to identify the essential factors influencing the software reliability. These are the usage of a procedure model, the test factor and the human factor of the software developers themselves. These factors have been considered to create a neuro-fuzzy-based concept, which characterizes and consolidates them to realize an estimation of the software quality. The possibility to estimate the software quality, especially dynamically already during the software development process, will entail a huge benefit to programmers and manufacturers. Effects, methods or circumstances influencing the software quality in a negative or positive way can be numerically described and rated. On basis of that, necessary optimizations in the development process can be performed in time to guarantee a high quality of the software.",

Conventional monitoring processes involve manual collection of samples from various points in the distribution network, followed by laboratory testing and analysis. This process has proved to be ineffective since it is laborious, time consuming and lacks real-time results to promote proactive response to water contamination. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have since been considered a promising alternative to complement conventional monitoring processes. These networks are relatively affordable and allow measurements to be taken remotely, in real-time and with minimal human intervention. This work surveys the application of WSN in environmental monitoring, with particular emphasis on water quality. Various WSN based water quality monitoring methods suggested by other authors are studied and analyzed, taking into account their coverage, energy and security concerns. The work also compares and evaluates sensor node architectures proposed the various authors in terms of monitored parameters, microcontroller/microprocessor units (MCU) and wireless communication standards adopted, localization, data security implementation, power supply architectures, autonomy and potential application scenarios.",

As a result of the first stage, the HealthCatalog ontology was developed. This ontology models generic items included in a health catalog and their management. Secondly, a further refinement of the ontology was conducted by specifically studying the case of gloves. Twenty-seven references of different glove types were modeled and included in the ontology during the stage two. A prototype was then developed as a proof of concept and for the evaluation of the ontology. Finally, a usability evaluation was planned to improve the ontology and obtain feedback from experts after testing the system. Experts involved in the evaluation stressed its potential use in a real clinical environment and the benefits it would bring in terms of cost and sharing knowledge among clinical personnel. Our proposed ontology-based system provides an understandable and organized solution to capture knowledge regarding item management and usage. It addresses the integration challenge of health catalogs while providing a framework for collaborative sharing and knowledge acquisition among clinicians.",

Extreme reliance on data demands quality assurance and trust on processes. Data Provenance is information that can be used to reason about the current state of a data object. Provenance can be broadly described as the information that explains where a piece of data object came from, how it was derived or created, who was involved in said creation, manipulations involved, processes applied, etc. It consists of information that had an effect on the data, evolving to its present state. Provenance has been used widely for the authenticity of data and processes. Despite having such a wide range of uses and applications, provenance poses vexing privacy and integrity challenges. Provenance data itself is, therefore, critical and it must be secured. Over the years, a number of secure provenance schemes have been proposed. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of secure provenance schemes and its associated security issues. In this paper, we have discussed why secure provenance is needed, what are its essential characteristics, and what objectives it serves? We describe the lifecycle of secure provenance and highlighted how trust is achieved in different domains by its application. Firstly, a detailed taxonomy of existing secure provenance schemes is presented. Then, a comparative analysis of existing secure provenance schemes, which highlights their strengths and weaknesses is also provided. Furthermore; we highlight future trends, which should be focused upon by the research community.",

With the application of CPS technology in transportation, energy, manufacturing and other fields, the way people interact with engineered systems is significantly changed. Despite of plenty of benefits, CPS also suffers from many problems and the most important one is data security. On the one hand, the location of data is a link between the cyber space and the physical world. In some scenarios, the data is only allowed to be used in the desired areas, and thus the mobility of CPS devices introduces the location-related security requirements in data management. On the other hand, note that the monitors and sensor devices keep collecting and exchanging sensitive data all the time. As a result, it is a major security challenge for CPS to safely distribute massive amounts of data to the clients with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a new location verification protocol called Ears, which prevents both shortening and lengthening distance frauds in CPS environments. Besides, we design a secure location-sensitive data sharing (SLDS) scheme based on Ears, in which data access is controlled by identity as well as location and the shared data is re-encrypted after each retrieval. We can prove that the proposed Ears protocol and SLDS scheme can achieve the designed security properties. Furthermore, the experimental results show that our schemes are more efficient for real-world applications.",

It suggests that, while there are significant similarities between their respective sources, tools and purposes, there are also arguable differences between consumer protection law and data protection law. One such arguable difference is found in that, while consumer protection law can be seen to merely set a floor in its pursuit of a sufficiently high level of consumer protection, data protection law – due to its clearly articulated dual purposes of (a) protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and (b) providing for the free movement of such data – sets both a floor and a ceiling. Having discussed the relationship between consumer protection law and data protection law in more detail, the argument is made that it seems possible to conclude that the balance struck in the Data Protection Directive, and soon in the General Data Protection Regulation, places limitations on consumer protection law. The implications of this conclusion are then examined briefly in the context of some matters currently coming before the CJEU and the contours of a framework are presented, addressing situations where a data protection-based liability claim is pursued against a third-party non-controller under consumer protection law.",

Hollywood depicts them as the partying ‘bad boys/girls’ in such popular productions as Valley and The Social Network Software developers are essential for powering innovation in Silicon Valley. However, they are also injecting security risk into the software supply chain. By changing attitudes about who is responsible for security around third-party component usage, and educating teams about what can be done to discover, manage and remediate issues involving these components, modern software developers can build security into an environment where much of the code is written by someone outside their organisation, says Jeff Luszcz of Flexera Software.",

abstract = "In a future internet of things, an increasing number of every-day objects becomes interconnected with each other. Current network solutions are not designed to connect a large number of co-located devices with different characteristics and network requirements. To cope with increasingly large and heterogeneous networks, this paper presents an ‘incentive driven’ networking approach that optimizes the network performance by taking into account the network goals (‘incentives’) of all individual devices. Incentive driven networking consists of the following steps. First, devices dynamically search for co-located devices with similar network preferences and hardware and/or software capabilities. Next, if such devices are found, communities consisting of interconnected objects with similar network expectations are formed on an ad hoc basis. Due to the similarities between the involved devices, it is easier to optimize the network performance of each individual community. Finally, different communities can cooperate with each other by activating and sharing (software or hardware) network resources. The paper describes which (future) research is needed to realize this vision and illustrates the concepts with a number of simple algorithms. Through an experimental proof-of-concept implementation with two networks of resource-constrained embedded devices, it is shown that even these simple algorithms already result in improved network performance. Finally, the paper describes a large number of example use cases that can potentially benefit from our innovative networking methodology.",

We wish to bring a reflection in the field of connected health by setting up a remote medical follow-up. In this context, the connected object presented in this article aims at implementation a longitudinal follow-up of the walk by a health professional. Continuous remote data analysis applies behavior learning methods by modeling walking habits and allows the detection of deviations by application of thresholds defined by the expert. We propose an instrumented shoe insole to provide such monitoring (number of steps, distance covered and gait speed). In this perspective, we designed a low power microelectronic device integrated into the thickness of an insole in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of such a device in laboratory and in living conditions. The project called “FOOT-TEST” is funded by the DIRECCTE of the Midi-Pyrenees Region in France. This project brought together a manufacturer who specializes in the design of foot-care systems, geriatricians and our laboratory specialized in electronics to propose a technical solution adapted to frail individuals. Two smart insole prototypes have been produced and a first evaluation of the smart insole in real use conditions has been performed. According to user feedback, the smart insole seems to be much easier to use than commercial connected pedometers. Moreover, in terms of performance, the smart insole provides better results. In this paper, we present specifications of the device, technological choices and the design of two versions of the smart insole, methods used to measure desired settings, a first evaluation of the system and, finally, preliminary conclusions and work in progress.",

In this paper, we show how recent progress in standardization can provide the basis for protecting data from diverse sensor devices when outsourcing data processing and storage to the cloud. To this end, we present our Sensor Cloud Security Library (SCSlib) that enables cloud service developers to transparently access cryptographically protected sensor data in the cloud. SCSlib specifically allows domain specialists who are not security experts to build secure cloud services. Our evaluation proves the feasibility and applicability of SCSlib for commodity cloud computing environments.",

This paper employs a multi-level perspective approach to socio-technological transitions to examine why the Canadian province of Ontario has seen a relatively smooth transition of smart meter technologies from the niche to regime levels as compared with other Canadian provinces, and other jurisdictions in the United States, European Union, and Australia. The paper also examines the reasons for Ontario's advanced legislative and policy framework around Smart Grid development, relative to those of other provinces. The complex institutional landscape around electricity that has emerged in Ontario since the break-up of the province's monopoly utility Ontario Hydro in the late 1990s emerges as a significant factor in both outcomes. The role of the province's municipally-owned LDCs spell out "local distribution companies (LDCs) as the primary agents for smart meter deployment, as opposed to a dominant vertically integrated utility, appears to have had an important mediating effect on public opposition to smart meters. With respect to Smart Grid policy, the diversity of high capacity institutional actors that now define the province's electricity policy landscape has facilitated the emergence of several interagency policy development niches. In a manner consistent with the concept of technological niches in the socio-technical transitions literature, the interagency status of these policy niches has shielded them from the regime level selective pressures that would likely have existed in a more unified institutional structure, and empowered new policy ideas to move from the niche to regime levels. These outcomes have significant implications for the understanding of socio-technological transitions, particularly around the role of institutional complexity in the emergence of niches for technology and policy development purposes and in niche to regime level transitions.",

abstract = "Over the past few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to transform urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services that make smart cities “smart” are curated by using data streams of smart cities i.e., inhabitants’ location information, digital engagement, transportation, environment and local government data. Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable attempts have been made to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants’ data. However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have their own reservations — service provider trust, reliability of the sensed data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning in smart cities, namely the ‘Smart Secure Service Provisioning’ (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition, transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The proposed framework ensures inhabitants’ privacy, and also guarantees integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols by an automated security verification tool called Scyther.",

Wearable devices can generate a huge amount of health data, causing big data to be one of the most prominent features. The privacy and security of big data-based MHNs are major concerns of users, and these are the overriding obstacles that stand in the way of the wider adoption of MHNs. For the sake of security, health data is encrypted and stored on an untrusted server. However, the flexibility of the data is thereby affected, such as a search over encrypted health data, or authorization control for a search and verification of the search result. To address these problems, we propose a verifiable keyword search scheme for big data-based MHNs with fine-grained authorization control. In the proposed scheme, when sending the search request to the healthcare provider for the first time, the user needs to check whether he or she has the right to search within encrypted health data. Only authorized users can generate valid trapdoors for searching. Our verification technique is constructed based on an invertible Bloom lookup table and a Merkle hash tree, which can verify the completeness and correctness of the search result even if an empty set is returned by a dishonest healthcare provider. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure against chosen keyword attacks. The proposed scheme is efficient with low computation load, which can be used to perform eyword searches and verify the search results quickly in a big data environment.",

abstract = "The energy industry is undergoing significant disruption. This research outlines that, whilst challenging, this disruption is also an emerging opportunity for electricity utilities. One such opportunity is leveraging the developments in data analytics and machine learning. As the uptake of renewable energy technologies and complimentary control systems increases, electricity grids will likely transform towards dense microgrids with high penetration of renewable generation sources, rich in network and customer data, and linked through intelligent, wireless communications. Data digitisation and analytics has already impacted numerous industries, and its influence on the energy sector is growing, as computational capabilities increase to manage big data, and as machines develop algorithms to solve the energy challenges of the future. The objective of this paper is to address how far the uptake of renewable technologies can go given the constraints of existing grid infrastructure, and provides a qualitative assessment of how higher levels of renewable energy penetration can be facilitated by incorporating even broader technological advances in the fields of data analytics and machine learning. Western Australia is used as a contextualised case-study, given its abundance and diverse renewable resources (solar, wind, biomass, and wave) and isolated networks, making a high penetration of renewables a feasible target for policy makers over coming decades.",

In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system.",

Timely loss-of-contact detection between devices in pervasive systems using mobile networks is an important aspect for both functionality and user experience. Traditional schemes where time-to-live is defined by the service provider are not adequate in mobile networks where communication failures are frequent. On the other hand, schemes using keep-alive messaging tend to increase the communication overhead, in particular if the time to detect a loss of contact needs to be short. We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application. Our solution was evaluated with usage data from a professional application built on the PalCom framework. The measurements show a 96 % decrease of the communication overhead while still maintaining the same system responsiveness.",

As an entry-point into this question, it proposes and explores the concept of post-normal engineering. Using the driverless car as a microcosm of the smart city, Part One of the paper explores two dimensions of post-normal engineering—the acceptance of negotiated risk and the dependence on open innovation—in order to bring out how these environments are associated with disequilibrium and uncertainty. The second part of the paper offers a comparison of two virtue-oriented approaches, one by Dale Jamieson and the other by Michel Puech, for living well under such conditions. Part Three argues that, under such conditions, virtues of the kind they identify as important to cultivate under these conditions need to be supplemented with virtues of a different, disequilibrating, order, and suggests attuned spontaneity and informal generosity as two examples. A brief conclusion traces some implications of the idea of “disequilibrating” virtue for technological design.",

Modern urban agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. The currently popular notion of ‘smart cities’ aims to provide a new perspective for sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our ‘urban century’. In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called ‘urban piazza’ strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of ‘big digital data’ management in urban systems.",

First, “actor – e-service – actor”, where actors are humans, but e-service is provided remotely through a software platform, e.g., through social media. Second, a scenario, where an e-service is provided by software instead of a human: “software – e-service – actor”. An example of such a scenario is an e-banking website. In this case, the software remains under consumer control. Finally, a scenario where an e-service is provided by a software agent instead of a human or software. A software agent is a program that autonomously performs tasks in a given time and place according to predefined instructions of its owner; hence: “software agent – e-service – actor”. An example of such scenario is a software agent that selects ads in search engines. Such an agent can continuously operate in the background on the consumer's behalf, without the consumer's direct control. In concluding, the consequences of a shift from classical services to digital e-services on the education marketplace are discussed.",

In this study, we used a flexible electrode material comprised of organic conductor-elastomer-metal nanoparticles, as the core material and the inkjet printing method as the core process. These were used to form a flexible sensor for electronic skin applications, which involved vertically laminated sensors that utilize different sensing principles, thus enabling the realization of a flexible bimodal sensor with negligible interference. The pressure sensor with low resistivity and a flexible electrode, which was implemented using the sophisticated synthesis method, performed well under low-voltage (0.5mV) operation conditions, exhibited pressure sensitivity over a wide range (3Pa to 5kPa), and showed excellent reliability characteristics (100,000 cycles) that can withstand severe mechanical stress. The temperature sensor, which was formed by a long bent organic conductor-metal line, changes its resistance with temperature, has a resistance change sensitivity of 0.32% per degree of temperature change, and exhibits a hysteresis-free temperature sensing capability. In particular, this device has maintained its robustness even over 5000 bending cycles. The 25 pixels temperature-pressure bimodal sensor array demonstrates very fast response rates, high sensitivity, and negligible interference performance. The low-resistivity/high-flexibility conducting electrode, inkjet printing process, device architecture, and integration scheme proposed in this study are expected to be widely used for electronic skin, multi-mode sensors, and flexible devices.",

abstract = "Since the terrorist events of the 11th September 2001, the world as it was once known was changed forever. It was these catastrophic terrorist actions over fifteen years ago that saw the dawn of a new era with heightened security across many everyday areas of society that had not previously witnessed such scrutiny or control. Coupling this elevated risk of physical and technical aggression with the ever-increasing global per capita energy demand – there has been witnessed a continually growing reliance on nuclear energy for baseline power generation, a form of electricity production that requires both the necessary international safeguards and controls for its safe use. As more and more of the global energy budget is provided by low-carbon sources (over highly-polluting fossil fuels), the volume of nuclear material in existence will grow substantially – requiring considerable attention and policy to ensure its long-term safety and security. This commentary describes the vast range of policy challenges faced by the nuclear industry resulting from the rapid technological advancements being made across society, and how these directly (and indirectly) affect global nuclear security, as well as providing a thorough discussion on how best these challenges may be overcome.",

The Internet connectivity to small sensor nodes carried by patients allows remote access to their bio-signals. To promote these features the healthcare wireless sensor networks (HWSN) are used. In these networks mobility support is a key issue in order to keep patients under real-time monitoring even when they move around. To keep sensors connected to the network, they should change their access points of attachment when patients move to a new coverage area along an infirmary. This process, called handover, is responsible for continuous network connectivity to the sensors. This paper presents a detailed performance evaluation study considering three handover mechanisms for healthcare scenarios (Hand4MAC, RSSI-based, and Backbone-based). The study was performed by simulation using several scenarios with different number of sensors and different moving velocities of sensor nodes. The results show that Hand4MAC is the best solution to guarantee almost continuous connectivity to sensor nodes with less energy consumption.",

However the production, supply, and processing sectors of the food chain are fragmented and this lack of cohesion results in a failure to adopt new and innovative technologies, products and processes. The potential of using information technologies, for example, data storage, communication, cloud, in tandem with data science, for example, data mining, pattern recognition, uncertainty modelling, artificial intelligence, etc., through the whole food chain including processing within the food industry, retailers and even consumers, will provide stakeholders with novel tools regarding the implementation of a more efficient food safety management system.",

This paper argues that emergent aspects of food policy in the UK can be understood as a social movement, which sustains development by way of bottom-up, horizontal networks of urban groups, and business associations. It suggests that as platforms of food provision, such on-line food networks offer a counter-point to top-down smart city development predicated on high-tech infrastructure. Such complex arrangements demonstrate how the city needs to be understood as a networked field of action, not simply an administratively bounded construction. Within the field of action movements emerge, whose activism is successful in influencing policymaking, and in shaping the municipal strategies assembled to build the regional structure of food provision. The caveat this paper highlights is that, although successful in influencing policy and municipal strategies, the activism of these movements has not been as effective as might have been anticipated from such a democratic impulse. This lack reflects the limited power of cities in the UK over the structure of food provision, but also the troubled extension of public participation into a territory marked by corporate and agricultural policy. The paper bases its claims about the nature of urban food policies in cities on a case study of networks in Bristol, including interviews with key activists, analysis social media networks and documents. The evidence supports claims that urban food developments represent a form of social movement, whose activism is democratic in its attempts to be both sustainable and inclusive.",

The patient’s data can be accessed using WMSN by medical professionals from anywhere across the globe with the help of Internet. As the patient sensitive information is transmitted over an insecure WMSN, so providing a secure access and privacy of the patient’s data are challenging issues in WMSN environments. However, in literature, to provide secure data access, few user authentication protocols exist. Most of these existing protocols may not be applicable to WMSNs for providing user’s anonymity. To fill these gaps, in this article, we propose an architecture for patient monitoring health-care system in WMSN and then design an anonymity-preserving mutual authentication protocol for mobile users. We used the AVISPA tool to simulate the proposed protocol. The results obtained indicate that the proposed authentication protocol resists the existing well known attacks. In addition, the BAN logic model confirms mutual authentication feature of the proposed protocol. Moreover, an informal cryptanalysis is also given, which ensures that the proposed protocol withstands all known attacks. We perform a comparative discussion of the proposed protocol against the existing protocols and the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is efficient and robust. Specifically, the proposed protocol is not only effective in providing robustness against common security threats, but it also offers an efficient login, robust mutual authentication, and user-friendly password change.",

However, detecting stress in real life with an unobtrusive wrist device is a challenging task. The objective of this study is to develop a method for stress detection that can accurately, continuously and unobtrusively monitor psychological stress in real life. First, we explore the problem of stress detection using machine learning and signal processing techniques in laboratory conditions, and then we apply the extracted laboratory knowledge to real-life data. We propose a novel context-based stress-detection method. The method consists of three machine-learning components: a laboratory stress detector that is trained on laboratory data and detects short-term stress every 2min; an activity recognizer that continuously recognizes the user’s activity and thus provides context information; and a context-based stress detector that uses the outputs of the laboratory stress detector, activity recognizer and other contexts, in order to provide the final decision on 20-min intervals. Experiments on 55days of real-life data showed that the method detects (recalls) 70% of the stress events with a precision of 95%.",

However, the impact of innovation within animal identification systems has not yet been carried out to quantify benefits during common fieldwork in real dairy sheep flocks. In particular, systematic milk production record represents a fundament to monitor real time performance of each single ewe, before a cumulative datum about flock output. The rational management of dairy ewes should rely on technological tools to create sub-groups according to production performance in a quick and reliable way. This trial aimed to investigate efficacy, reliability and efficiency associate to two different identification systems for monitoring individual milk production throughout the lactation in sheep flocks. Qualitative and quantitative indicators for each criterion, were useful for the assessment of activities and output correctness. Experimental activities were carried in two different farms of Sardinia. In both farms, animals were individually identified by means of an endoruminal ceramic bolus (transponder HDX 134.2 kHz, according to ISO Standards 11784–11785) and by conventional plastic ear tag. In both farms, during milking, groups of ewes were monitored (24 animals per round) by 2 trained technicians. In EID ewes, equipment to check individual transponder’s code and data recording consisted of a handy reader (Gesimpex Com. S.L., Barcelona, Spain); in ET ewes, individual ET code and milk production were visually inspected and typed on a handy data store equipment (ABB Immediate Business System PLC – Radix). Time needed for accomplishment of activities was taken for the two identification systems with a chronometer. In the two farms, a total of 553 animals were monitored for five times (controls were scheduled monthly) throughout the lactation period. Average time for reading and recording individual code and production for EID vs. ET resulted 6″/sheep vs. 11″/sheep. Transponder’s code resulted correctly checked and repeatedly associated in 100% of readings. EID system of diary ewes shows to improve production recording and data transfer in comparison with conventional ET system with advantageous technical relationships between fieldwork activities.",

Among advanced technologies, AR in particular has the greatest potential to address those challenges and facilitate the translation of PNMs into formidable clinical application of personalized therapy. As AR is about to adapt additional new methods, such as speech, voice recognition, eye tracing and motion tracking, to enable interaction with host response or biological systems in 3-D space, a combination of multiple approaches to accommodate varying environmental conditions, such as public noise and atmosphere brightness, will be explored to improve its therapeutic outcomes in clinical applications.

abstract = "Purpose
The objective of this work is to design, implement and introduce the application of 32-channel system in the biomedical field. The main aim is to introduce the system application at homes in a domestic scale.
Design/methodology/approach
This research article covers the use of the 32-channel cost effective data acquisition device and its application software for the patient monitoring system. The design process includes knitting the sensors in the fiber to create a wearable fabric that can be fitted on a body for monitoring purposes.
Findings
Human body temperature, oxygen level around the body, ECG, EMG muscle signal and PH level detection using 32-channel system with LabVIEW front panel control for alarm triggering. The monitoring can be done remotely. Data is connected to the hospital server. All the graphical interface and simulation is created using LabVIEW. This application can be alternatively viewed as a Human Impact System.
Research limitations/implications
Digilent Chip KIT max32 is used since it rooms enough channel required for the interface software. Sensors such as ECG, EMG, Oxygen Pulse, PH and temp are knitted in the fiber of clothes to introduce a wear able fabric. The total of 32-channel is used by the complete application. Some channels are used for alerting in case, if the values from the sensors are abnormal.
Practical implications
Chip KIT Shield for connecting sensors, attaching the output pins to the LED indicators and display have been created. Circuitry for measuring temperature, pulse, oxygen level, PH, EMG, and ECG have been designed and printed. This application can be used at home. For the wearer, the temperature level of different body parts, heart ECG level, muscle pulses signals, oxygen level around the body and the PH can be detected and displayed remotely from the LabVIEW front panel screen. The desired alarm level can be set from the front panel for every specific sensor. For this step, virtual channels can be created for allowing the user to set any random value for alarm depending on the patient age. These custom alarm levels are for user’s own record, while the hospital works with the standard levels. Once the sensor value passes through the alarm value, then the corresponding alarm will be triggered. There are two modes for alarm. One is automatic and other is manual. In the manual mode, user will set the alarm itself whereas in, automatic mode, the system will use the basic decision making techniques.
Originality/value
Combining the field of biomedical, computer science and electrical engineering, this is the first research of its own sort utilizing the 32-channel system.",

abstract = "The “human dimensions” of energy use in buildings refer to the energy-related behaviors of key stakeholders that affect energy use over the building life cycle. Stakeholders include building designers, operators, managers, engineers, occupants, industry, vendors, and policymakers, who directly or indirectly influence the acts of designing, constructing, living, operating, managing, and regulating the built environments, from individual building up to the urban scale. Among factors driving high-performance buildings, human dimensions play a role that is as significant as that of technological advances. However, this factor is not well understood, and, as a result, human dimensions are often ignored or simplified by stakeholders. This paper presents a review of the literature on human dimensions of building energy use to assess the state-of-the-art in this topic area. The paper highlights research needs for fully integrating human dimensions into the building design and operation processes with the goal of reducing energy use in buildings while enhancing occupant comfort and productivity. This research focuses on identifying key needs for each stakeholder involved in a building’s life cycle and takes an interdisciplinary focus that spans the fields of architecture and engineering design, sociology, data science, energy policy, codes, and standards to provide targeted insights. Greater understanding of the human dimensions of energy use has several potential benefits including reductions in operating cost for building owners; enhanced comfort conditions and productivity for building occupants; more effective building energy management and automation systems for building operators and energy managers; and the integration of more accurate control logic into the next generation of human-in-the-loop technologies. The review concludes by summarizing recommendations for policy makers and industry stakeholders for developing codes, standards, and technologies that can leverage the human dimensions of energy use to reliably predict and achieve energy use reductions in the residential and commercial buildings sectors.",

abstract = "Industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) applications are mostly time-bound, mission-critical and highly delay sensitive applications therefore IWSN defines strict, stringent and unique QoS requirements such as timeliness, reliability and availability. In IWSN, unlike other sensor networks, late arrival of packets or delay or disruption to an on-going communication are considered as critical failure. Also, because IWSN is deployed in the overcrowded industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band it is difficult to meet this unique QoS requirements due to stiff competition for bandwidth from other technologies operating in ISM band resulting in scarcity of spectrum for reliable communication and/or disruption of ongoing communication. However, cognitive radio (CR) provides more spectral opportunities through opportunistic-use of unused licensed spectrum while ensuring minimal interference to licensed users. Similarly, spectrum handoff, which is a new type of handoff in cognitive radio, has the potential to offer increase bandwidth, reliable, smooth and interference-free communication for IWSNs through opportunistic-use of spectrum, minimal switching-delays, and efficient target channel selection strategies as well as effective link recovery maintenance. As a result, a new paradigm known as cognitive radio industrial wireless sensor network (CR-IWSN) has become the interest of recent research efforts. In this paper, we highlight and discuss important QoS requirements of IWSN as well as efforts of existing IWSN standards to address the challenges. We discuss the potential and how cognitive radio and spectrum handoff can be useful in the attempt to provide real-time reliable and smooth communication for IWSNs.",

In essence, SIoT adapts a service-oriented architecture where heterogeneous IoT devices can offer or request autonomous services and collaborate on behalf of their owners. Operating Systems (OSs) are employed in IoT devices as they offer portability, threading support and access to development libraries; thus allowing easiness in IoT application development. Several OSs are available for IoT devices, but selecting an OS and hardware befitting for a particular IoT application is a critical task. In case of SIoT, the specific OS selection for hardware devices in various applications is even more challenging because of their collaborative nature. Existing surveys on OSs are mostly domain oriented and lack the discussion on hardware architectural features. As a consequence, it is infeasible for developers to choose best-suited OS for various hardware platforms which results in their underperformance in many application scenarios. This paper considers standard features of OS as well as hardware IoT platforms and provides an OS-to-hardware architectures features-mapping while exploring the unique requirements of SIoT applications. In doing so, resource-constrained IoT devices are particularly emphasized due to their memory constraints and power limitations. Further, a model OS architecture is proposed for devices in SIoT applications and associated open research challenges are identified. This research will benefit developers to best utilize IoT platform resources and to envisage an efficient OS for futuristic SIoT applications.",

The novelty of our methodology lies in the semantic linking of video object recognition results from visual and thermal cameras with Building Information Models (BIM). The current limitations and possibilities of certain building information streams in the context of fire safety or fire incident management are addressed in this paper. Furthermore, our data management tools match higher-level semantic metadata descriptors of BIM and deep-learning based visual object recognition and classification networks. Based on these matches, estimations can be generated of camera, objects and event positions in the BIM model, transforming it from a static source of information into a rich, dynamic data provider. Previous work has already investigated the possibilities to link BIM and low-cost point sensors for fireground understanding, but these approaches did not take into account the benefits of video analysis and recent developments in semantics and feature learning research. Finally, the strengths of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art is its (semi-)automatic workflow, generic and modular setup and multi-modal strategy, which allows to automatically create situational awareness, to improve localization and to facilitate the overall fire understanding.",

However, The traditional WBANs devices have limited computing and storage capabilities. These restrictions limit the services that WBANs can provide to users. Thus the concept of Cloud-aided WBANs has been proposed to enhance the capabilities of WBANs. In addition, due to the openness of the cloud computing environment, the protection of the user's physiological information and privacy remains a major concern. In previous authentication protocols, few of them can protect the user's private information in insecure channel. In this paper, we propose a cloud-aided lightweight certificateless authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless body area networks. Our protocol ensures that no one can obtain user's real identity except for the network manager in the registration phase. Moreover, in the authentication phase, the network manager cannot know the user's real identity. Note that, through the security analysis, we can conclude that our protocol can provide stronger security protection of private information than most of existing schemes in insecure channel.",

The paper discusses how the open access market can eliminate barriers at the service level, allowing any number of service providers to compete in response to market drivers. The paper emphasises that the spatial and temporal granularity at which capacity can be purchased, allows for smaller entities to acquire resources, which is important for new entrants testing the water and those with non-standard business plans.

For example, monitoring people with dementia using commercially available devices that measure heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and activity level could be used to predict episodic behavioral and psychological symptoms before they become distressing or disruptive. However, since these devices are designed primarily for fitness assessment, validation of the sensors in a controlled environment with the target cohort population is needed. In this study, we present validation results using a commercial fitness tracker, the Hexoskin sensor vest, with thirty-one participants aged 65 and older. Estimated physiological measures investigated in this study are heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and activity level of the participants. Findings indicate that while the processed step count, heart rate, and breathing rate show strong correlations to the clinically accepted gold standard values, lung volume and activity level do not. This indicates the need to proceed cautiously when making clinical decisions using such sensors, and suggests that users should focus on the three strongly correlated parameters for further analysis, at least in the older population. The use of physiological measurement devices such as the Hexoskin may eventually become a non-intrusive way to continuously assess physiological measures in older adults with dementia who are at risk for distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms.",

Food engineering is at a crossroads. Inertia, combined with diminishing research funding, declining new academic positions, combined with disruptive and emerging competitive adjacent domains have a heavy toll on the field and its attractiveness for talented faculty members and students. The proliferation and flourishing of many bio-disciplines highlight the acute need for food engineering profession to revise its vision, strategy and missions and to reinvigorate and expand its horizon. Open innovation is a concept developed for commercial applications for gaining competitive advantages. Open innovation is based on utilizing both external and internal ideas and open channels for accessing and employing knowledge and solutions. Open innovation main philosophy should be adopted to integrate, assimilate and synergize food engineering core fundamental principles and to build on the accelerating developments in emerging knowledge, science and technology.
Scope and approach
To fully benefit from the vast future emerging opportunities, food engineering is faced with a plethora of demanding challenges (e.g., new curricula, innovation ecosystem, partnerships, creativity, multidisciplinary, entrepreneurship, sustainability, food and nutrition security, population growth, health and wellness, nutrition, bioavailability). ‘Enginomics’ (engineering + omics) - a new term coined to express some of the major food engineering future challenges that holistically combines food processing and human internal digestion. It calls for studying human internal transport phenomena, utilization of new techniques (e.g., micro-processing, virtualization) for modelling and simulation, emerging topics (e.g., bioavailability, signaling, satiety, personalized nutrigenomics, targeting, pro- and prebiotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology), as well as traditional food and product engineering.
Key findings and conclusions
The food engineering domain should rise to future mounting challenges and opportunities by redefining its vision and strategy recapturing its significant roles, and stopping the loss of its graduates in the competitions with other fields. Several paradigm shifts are recommended including reinventing its curricula in pursuing of excellence with a start-up-university (innoversity) mentality, new mindset for promoting open innovation, implementing virtualization, embracing enginomics and social responsibility. As a part of enginomics and health and wellness, the development of low cost, fast and accurate bioavailability tests is required. Open innovation provides food engineers with the unique prospects for spearheading the four-helix innovation ecosystem. Both basic and applied science and utilizing of the most advanced and up-to-date technologies and scientific breakthroughs are paramount.",

Smart City refer to the city that integrates modern technologies for automated and efficient service providing to enhance citizens’ lifestyle. Latest studies show that like 60 present of the whole world's population will be living in urban environments by the year 2030. This massively growing population in urban environments leads to the need of advanced management approaches that use latest IT platforms and techniques for smartening every city-related service. Such emergent integration of technologies faces several security- related challenges because of not considering security tests of new deployed technologies, in addition to not engaging other system parties with security incidents due to the huge communication. On the other side, high complexity, high interdependency and intensive communication lead to unbounded attack surface and cryptography-related issues. In our paper, we intend to provide detailed overview based on literature of smart cities’ major security problems and current solutions. Moreover, we present several influencing factors that affect data and information security in smart cities.",

VLC technology has emerged as an alternative solution to radio-frequency (RF) wireless systems, due to its various merits, e.g., ubiquity, power efficiency, no RF radiation, and security. With VLC, critical bio-medical signals, including electrocardiography (ECG), can be transmitted in places where RF radiation is restricted. This potential advantage of VLC could save more lives in emergency situations. A time hopping (TH) scheme is employed to transfer multiple medical-data streams in real time with a simple system design. Multiple data streams are transmitted using identical color LEDs and go into an optical detector. The received multiple data streams are demodulated and rearranged using a TH-based demodulator. The medical data is then monitored and managed to provide the necessary medical care for each patient.",

This study proposes a novel observation perspective that grasps the micro view of data information from real processes, and does not lose its effectiveness even if the recipes vary. The proposed aging measuring includes the following main procedures: firstly, acquiring specific process flows composed of recipe steps; secondly, analyzing the local areas corresponding to each process flow; thirdly, capturing sensing values and the corresponding setting information related to the specific process flows; fourth, generating a local feature in a time interval corresponding to each of the process flows according to the corresponding local areas; finally, generating an aging trend on the basis of the local features, and determining whether to send a replacement early-warning. The experiments show that the proposed approach to the aging diagnosis can effectively offer a replacement warning before the heating coils run down.",

When combined with a variety of sensors, a traditional Holter becomes a mobile health device. Based on Holter data and sensor data, this paper proposes a supplementary diagnosis and treatment program. The solution consists of three main steps: I. Perform segmentation of ECG (Electrocardiography) data and conduct feature extraction. Build the personalized ECG templates, apply factor graph and max-sum algorithm for precise template matching, and realize the feature extraction and representation of ECG data. II. Use the action sensor data for action classification and identification. As an important factor of health monitoring, body movements are categorized as resting, walking, going upstairs and downstairs, flipping and sudden change. The improved classification algorithm achieves high accuracy identification. III. Combine ECG data and action data for clustering analysis. The proposed solution improves the affinity propagation algorithm and allow doctors to supervise the clustering procedure. A knowledge matrix is introduced accordingly, thus achieving an iterable clustering optimization. With the help of these components, the innovative approach is able to integrate the Holter data and sensor data, meanwhile, doctors are encouraged to participate in the process of clustering algorithm. Our system is capable of not only assisting doctors in quickly determining the most valuable information, but also of building a personalized private repository for patients. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is an efficient, accurate, and interactive auxiliary diagnostic and a therapeutic support tool.",

These sensor nodes can collect biomedical data of the patient and transmit these valuable data to a data sink or a personal digital assistant. Later, health care service providers can get access to these data through authorization. The biomedical data are usually personal and privacy. Consequently, data confidentiality and user privacy are primary concerns for WBANs. In order to achieve these goals, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs based on low-entropy password and prove its security in the random oracle model. Our scheme enjoys strong anonymity in the sense that only the client knows his identity during the authentication phase of the scheme. Compared with other related proposals, our scheme is efficient in terms of computation. Moreover, the authentication of the client relies on human-rememberable password, which makes our scheme more suitable for applications in WBANs.",

In the present study, we narrowed the scope to firefighting services: how to decrease firefighting dismissals and help firefighters recognize the situation of fire events before arriving at the fire scenes. The absolute time from the fire station to the fire scene was considered to be the Mobility Kill Zone. Narrow roads and illegal parking were classified as the Operation Kill Zone. Areas with identified hazardous commodities and toxic substances were classified as the Identified Hazardous Zone. The areas cluttered with fire safety management objects were classified as the Fire Vulnerability Zone. Four models were suggested in our previous research and in the present study, we elaborated upon the models and examined new information technology (IT) to implement the models in rural and urban areas.",

abstract = "Persistent droughts, population growth, and consequences of the climate change put severeconstraints on agriculture in many Regions. This emergence can be ameliorated by: (i) either increasing the water supply, or (ii) reducing the water demand. One viable avenue is to enhance the irrigation’s efficiency by increasing on one hand the water supply (via the use of recycled waters), and on the other by decreasing the water consumption (via the use of drip irrigation, autonomous network of sensors and predictive models). To this aim, we propose an IoT-framework to assess and control the environmental risks associated with the use of recycled water(s). The IoT-framework is organized along the following main streams:(i) design an autonomous network of sensors that collect data about soil moisture and concentration of dissolved contaminants; (ii) assimilate these data together with precipitation forecast into predictive models of soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration; (iii) use these data-driven models to optimize the irrigation practices while minimizing their environmental impact. The fundamental pre-requisite common to (i)–(iii) is the proper processing of the soil data. The present paper will focus on such a topic by showing how it works within the IoT-framework.",

Wearable technology (wearables) is one approach that offers a viable means for ubiquitous, sustainable and scalable monitoring of the health of older adults in habitual free-living environments. Gait has been presented as a relevant (bio)marker in ageing and pathological studies, with objective assessment achievable by inertial-based wearables. Commercial wearables have struggled to provide accurate analytics and have been limited by non-clinically oriented gait outcomes. Moreover, some research-grade wearables also fail to provide transparent functionality due to limitations in proprietary software. Innovation within this field is often sporadic, with large heterogeneity of wearable types and algorithms for gait outcomes leading to a lack of pragmatic use. This review provides a summary of the recent literature on gait assessment through the use of wearables, focusing on the need for an algorithm fusion approach to measurement, culminating in the ability to better detect and classify falls. A brief presentation of wearables in one pathological group is presented, identifying appropriate work for researchers in other cohorts to utilise. Suggestions for how this domain needs to progress are also summarised.",

Thus, balancing the two is necessary for a sustainable and comfortable building stock. We review both research fields and their relationship using a data-driven approach. Based on specific search terms, all relevant abstracts from the Web Of Science database are downloaded and analyzed using the text mining software VOSviewer. We visualize the scientific landscapes of historic and recent trends, and analyze the citation network to investigate the interaction between thermal comfort and building control research. We find that building control focuses predominantly on energy savings rather than incorporating results from thermal comfort, especially when it comes to occupant satisfaction.

As a result, WP on-board g-code for turning and machine tool based real time cutting signals are combined into algorithm to measure indirect surface roughness of WP. Moreover, surface roughness value for every cut can be stored on-board of WP to detect the WP history and quality all over the product life cycle.

A target educational facility with classrooms was selected in Seoul, Republic of Korea. This study assumed that the classroom windows were fully opened and were then analyzed for indoor temperature distributions and energy consumption according to natural ventilation.

Most of the economic activities, trade, and foreign direct investment are mainly dependent on modern sources of ICT. The objective of present research work is to investigate the dynamic relationship between ICT, foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth incorporating trade and globalization for BRICS economies over 2000–2014 by employing OLS with fixed effects, the FMOLS, the DOLS and the group-mean estimator techniques robust to heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. Empirical results of the study suggest the long-run elasticities between ICT and economic growth, which suggests that ICT positively contributes to economic growth. Findings from long-run output elasticities show that both FDI and globalization have a long-run effect on economic growth. Furthermore, bi-directional causality exists between GDP and FDI, globalization and economic growth, and trade and economic growth. Also, unidirectional causality is running from globalization to trade. Globalization and ICT also Granger causes each other. Sensitivity analysis is employed to check whether findings of the study are valid and reliable for policy recommendation. The outcome of our study suggests policy recommendations for improving ICT with the focus on economic growth, trade openness and facilitation of foreign investment in BRICS countries.",

In particular, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and MoS2 are one of the most promising materials for humidity sensor due to the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of rGO and dangling bonds at the edge site of MoS2. Herein, we present 2D rGO/2D MoS2 hybrid composites (MS-GOs) synthesized by hydrothermal method. rGO and MoS2 are mixed with different molar ratios and drop-casted on SiO2 substrate with Pt interdigitated electrode. At an optimized molar ratio of rGO/MoS2, the sensor device exhibits high sensitivity, good selectivity, rapid response and recovery, and good linearity for humidity sensing. The enhanced sensing properties are attributed to the p-n junction between rGO and MoS2. Our work provides an efficient way for realizing high-performance and fast responding humidity sensors utilizing 2D-2D heterojunction materials based chemoresistive humidity sensors for use in diverse applications.",

Health monitoring systems deliver health status reports to actors such as people under monitoring, practitioners and coaches for several purposes. In this paper, we propose E-Ambulance framework, which is a smart ambulance system model that provides health monitoring of patients for remote medical professionals. As well as provide an automatic responses of suggestions and warnings to paramedic staff inside an ambulance. Sensor networks record and deliver health status information to other elements of system. Due to the availability of information from sensors networks, an auto response can take place by alarms supervised by Decision Maker unit. Remote decisions can be made in a medical center after receiving inputs generated inside an ambulance. Building a distributed real time system can handle all aspects of time critical systems and hide heterogeneity between elements and different types of data. Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard is used to build the proposed model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in terms of latency and throughput, experiments are performed over DDS middleware. Additionally, to have efficient configuration different QoS policies configurations of DDS are tuned.",

While several investigators have proposed and demonstrated algorithms and applications of CCC, the functional entities and responsibility centers for realizing CCC within microgrids in the context of multiple independent customers and distribution system entities have not been situated and/or studied. In this context, the term emergent microgrid may be used to define an electrical network that consists of local generation, loads, and storage. Such a grid has the potential to be clustered as a microgrid, but does not have all the CCC features to become a full-fledged microgrid. In this paper, a simple electric utility platform (SEUP) that is an end-to-end solution with all the hardware/software interfaces and components necessary for augmenting emergent microgrids with CCC into full-fledged microgrids is presented. SEUP abstracts the details of sensing and CCC for the microgrid developers, installers, operators and end-users to provide a seamless system. SEUP is distinctive from other CCC platforms in that it is entirely based on publicly available infrastructure resources (wireless cellular networks, internet and cloud computing) without any intellectual property restrictions. The paper introduces the functional roles, main architecture, components and security features of SEUP along with the results from a sample application case of a laboratory-scale power system.",

Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.",

This paper builds on various strategies on MAC designs in DTSN, and presents a comprehensive study on MAC protocols in DTSNs. We study MAC protocols, which trade long, unpredictable delays in data transmissions for energy conservation, mobility, throughput and/or reliability. We also present MAC protocols in DTSN which adapt their access control and transmission processes to the predictable delays. From the aspect of delay tolerance, the paper examines these MAC protocols through the trade-off between delay and other performance metrics, and shows the effectiveness and limitations of these MAC designs. Next, we review and analyze current MAC protocols that are suitable for DTSNs, and then discuss future research trends towards the design of new MAC protocols for DTSNs.",

abstract = "This paper proposes a set of perspectives for studying innovation ecosystems that are based on ecological research. Our perspectives are based on fundamental similarities between natural and business systems. We suggest that innovation ecosystems can be defined as pathways of interlinked business models. Pathways are characterised by the flows they convey not the types of business model that support the flows. These pathways convey material and informational resources, as well as value. Like the nutrient and energy pathways in natural ecosystems. Pathways help to recycle scarce resources such as customer attention and customer-derived information. Business model descriptions are similar to an organism's genome in that they describe limitations on sensing, acting and understanding. We conceptualise this as the ‘umwelt’; the self-world. These limitations have implications for how firms and customers interact with customers. They have other implications for how firms interact with each other in business model communities and how they accommodate each other. We illustrate and test these ecological perspectives using a case study of a healthcare smartphone app's ecosystem. We find that our perspectives can be used as novel methods of studying interactions between business models; or to study ecosystem building.",

Performing maintenance tasks in a complex environment is quite challenging and difficult due to complex, and possibly, underground facilities, uneasy access, human factors, heavy machineries, etc. Current technology is not acceptable because of significant delays in communication and data transmission, missing multi-input interfaces, and simultaneous supervision of multiple workers who are working in the extreme environment. The aim is to technically advance and combine several technologies and integrate them as integral part of a personnel safety system to improve safety, maintain availability, reduce errors and decrease the time needed for scheduled or ad hoc interventions. We emphasize on the aspects that were made “feasible” on the worker's side due to the equipment used (mobile computing equipment). We present that the demanding tasks that previously were simply undertaken on the fixed infrastructure are now possible on the mobile end. The research challenges lie in the development of real-time data-transmission, instantaneous analysis of data coming from different inputs, local intelligence in low power embedded systems, interaction with multiple on-site users, complex user interfaces, portability and wearability. This work is part EDUSAFE, a Marie Curie ITN (Initial Training Network) project focusing on research into the use of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) during planned and ad hoc maintenance in extreme work environments.",

However, even though the related technologies have been actively investigated, creating new businesses based on M2M communication is not easy. This study proposes a service innovation structure that visualizes the opportunities and difficulties of M2M service businesses. In our proposal, opportunities are classified as two types of value proposition (optimization and identification values) using the Sharing-Connecting-Analyzing-Identifying (SCAI) model. In addition, difficulties are discussed using a fishbone diagram. The SCAI model pays particular attention to the identification value, which tends to be ignored in other models. Opportunities and difficulties are structured as a map according to backcasting from a desired future M2M infrastructure. The backcasting approach is effective to untangle the intertwined difficulties. Using this opportunity-difficulty map, we can discuss and model M2M service businesses more clearly and strategically by recognizing the opportunities and the difficulties with stakeholders. A smart home case is used for explaining the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

In this perspective, the proposed research work is focused on the design and development of a practical solution, called Sophos-MS, able to integrate augmented reality contents and intelligent tutoring systems with cutting-edge fruition technologies for operators’ support in complex man-machine interactions. After establishing a reference methodological framework for the smart operator concept within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the proposed solution is presented, along with its functional and non-function requirements. Such requirements are fulfilled through a structured design strategy whose main outcomes include a multi-layered modular solution, Sophos-MS, that relies on Augmented Reality contents and on an intelligent personal digital assistant with vocal interaction capabilities. The proposed approach has been deployed and its training potentials have been investigated with field experiments. The experimental campaign results have been firstly checked to ensure their statistical relevance and then analytically assessed in order to show that the proposed solution has a real impact on operators’ learning curves and can make the difference between who uses it and who does not.",

This process is a major driving force in consumerization of IT, because sustainable application development at this scale will not be possible without direct involvement and innovation from consumers themselves. In this paper, we present our work on consumerization of service composition tools. First, we describe how consumer-facing services can be presented in a usable and intuitive way. Then, combining social computing with machine intelligence, we define a recommender system that supports consumers in sharing their knowledge and creativity in peer-tutored service composition, thus empowering consumers to create their own applications. This system recommends consumers with the required service composition knowledge based on mining procedural knowledge stored in previously defined compositions. Once such a group of consumers is identified, social computing tools are used to allow them to share this knowledge with their peers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this peer-tutored service composition model, we performed consumer satisfaction studies on our consumerized service composition tool Geppeto, which we extended with the described recommender system. Results show significant improvements in service composition in terms of performance and quality of experience.",

As the project is still ongoing, the final results of the work are yet to be seen, but, nonetheless worth documenting. This article is composed as an early analysis of the air quality sensing project as a framework for the larger smart city story of Christchurch. It provides an overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the implementation of new technologies in a post-disaster environment. We examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, with focus on the terminology used by citizens, academicians, government and corporations. We then argue that top-down technocratic solutions to urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather, they can result in misaligned expectations or outcomes for stakeholders at the government and citizen level. We conclude by suggesting that citizen-led initiatives may be a way to promote more nuanced and inclusive ways of addressing local urban problems in a smart cities context.",

This technology will enable a variety of new applications in sensing technology such as sensing car parts in the automotive industries (e.g., a suspension arm), innovative parts of an exoskeleton with integrated sensors for feedback information, or sensing structural components of vehicles. Furthermore, these sensors can result in more efficient quality assurance, are fully encapsulated against environmental influence, provide an ideal connection between sensor and metal matrix due to integration in the casting process, and enable engineers to place sensors directly at the place of interest without limitations. To reach the goal of integrating sensors in aluminum, we first focus on silicon-based sensors. We will show that sensor integration is possible, but the failure rate is high. This is analyzed by evaluating sensor data during casting. Due to the high difference in coefficiency of thermal expansion between aluminum and silicon, high thermal-induced compressive stress is generated in the silicon and is destroyed in the casting process during solidification cooling. This is why we convert in the second part of this paper to a new sensor concept, which is adapted to the conditions of the casting process. A sensor and its electrical connections are printed on aluminum sheets and integrated in aluminum in an industrial high-pressure casting process. As a result of these pre-tests, more than three-quarters of the devices survived the process of integration. Finally, we show that we obtain strain and temperature data from the cast part to develop smart components out of cast aluminum and to enable new sensing technologies.",

Hype draws attention to potential positive effects while excluding or under emphasizing a new technology's dependencies on other factors and its potential negative effects. Thus, hype presents a partial picture of technological innovation. In this paper, it is argued that dependencies and potential negative effects should be, and can be, included in the framing of new technologies. First, the limitations of hype are described with references to cases. Next, a template is provided to summarize big picture innovation framing. Dependencies for effectiveness and dependencies for efficient operation are included. This is because the potential of technological innovations to bring about positive effects is often dependent upon extraneous factors. Also, their efficient operation is often dependent upon many inter-related technological components. Potential negative effects are also included. Big picture framing is contrasted with the partial picture provided by hype. Then, examples of dependencies and potential negative effects are described for a range of technologies. Subsequently, a full example of big picture framing is provided for a hyped technology. In conclusion, it is argued that big picture framing can be a more informative starting point for understanding the potential of new technologies than vague hyperbole.",

The results show the different barriers can be classified into four clusters which are physical insecurities, emotional insecurities, the city infrastructure quality and the project management quality.

These demands concern aspects of product quality, food safety and security, traceability as well as environmental, ethical and societal expectations. The intensification of food production due to the global population growth and scarce production input resources set a challenging frame for efficient and yet still economical farming. Solutions based on new technologies have not become common due to their high costs, unclear benefits, complicatedness to use and maintain, and lack of interoperability. The Cropinfra project investigated how Internet-based service infrastructure enables networked production systems which support farmers to operate efficiently and fulfil farming demands using present and future technologies. The work was based on system engineering approach. Results from other projects were utilised to create a modelled system representation of the whole farm production infrastructure. The system was gradually implemented and its functionalities were verified in practice on farm scale at MTT's research farm in Finland. The technical implementation structure of built Cropinfra platform and its assisting functions in farm operation management, especially in precision farming, are introduced and assessed in this paper. The Cropinfra platform is a multi-layered service framework. The framework consists of sub-services such as sensors in machines and equipments, data collection and machine control, data storing, and external services e.g. for weather and disease forecast. The service layer follows the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm and utilises open data transfer and data sharing interfaces, and Future Internet technologies.",

The recorder supports wired and wireless body sensor networks and features remote programmability of a wide-range of hardware settings, data processing and reporting options and dynamic linking of libraries. The recorder is based on a three-layer architecture including data acquisition, processing and communication modules. The design is not dedicated to a particular purpose, and thus any remote diagnosis based on variety of spontaneous physiological signals (e.g. ECG, EMG) may be performed. The configuration of all three layers is independently controlled by the software and thus allows for real-time reconfiguration of sensors, processing level and report content.",

abstract = "There is an increasing interest to ensure operational and maintenance (O&M) operations from a strategic perspective, and there are opportunities for both producing companies and service providers to gain benefits. Research shows that the combined business models (products combined with services) have a positive effect on the business. Likewise, it is profitable to think strategically and in long term for enterprises offering maintenance services, especially using performance-based models. But for achieving these benefits the view of the business has to change. The focus should be on the values created and not in the offers in form of products or services. Moreover, the company needs to position itself as an actor not only in the value chain, but in a wider context referred to as the business ecosystem. Making such a shift of focus is hard though, and there is a need to understand both the current state of the business as well as the potential future directions. The framework presented in this paper is an attempt to meet these needs. The framework describes business model development in four levels. From maturity point of view, the four steps could be seen as the logical development of the business model from a narrow technical perspective to a holistic product-service perspective. The four levels could also be connected to the industrial development where level four supports Industry 4.0. Level four is referred to as Service Management 4.0. In particular, four key concepts reflect the concept of Service Management 4.0: the mix of products and services in customer offers, performance-based contracts, partnering and the business ecology concept.",

This displacement sensor has the advantages inherited from metal foil strain sensing, such as low cost, high precision, fast dynamic response and low power consumption, and can also measure displacement in two axes independently. The working principles and sensitivity are derived theoretically from key geometrical parameters of the shunt structure, and the linear response of strain values to the given displacement of two translational axes has been demonstrated experimentally. Furthermore, modal response, stress concentration, optimal gauges installation positions and bending deformation due to moment of the third axis are studied numerically.",

In this paper, we investigate the PM2.5 footprint of household energy consumption in Beijing based on input–output analysis. An inventory of primary and secondary household energy consumption is developed to quantify the direct PM2.5 emissions. The household PM2.5 footprint is then traced through goods or services that ultimately consumed by households to unveil the indirect PM2.5 emissions triggered by economic activities. PM2.5 fingerprint is also proposed to describe the characteristic of household PM2.5 footprint. Results show that PM2.5 footprint of Beijing households in 2010 is 7831.36 kt, of which 92.61% is contributed by urban households. The source of direct PM2.5 emissions in urban area is diversified, which is composed of coal (42.07%), heat and electricity (32.83%), gasoline (21.29%), natural gas (3.04%) and liquefied petroleum gas (0.77%), while in rural area, coal (98.09%) plays a dominant role. The indirect PM2.5 accounts for 99.96% of the total footprint in urban area, about one third of which is contributed by sectors of “Food Processing and Production”, “Healthcare and Social Security”, and “Farming, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Fishery”. The disparity between urban and rural households PM2.5 footprints is further evaluated with income levels. The PM2.5 footprint from living expenditures of urban households is found to be nearly twice as much as that of rural households. Such inventory of PM2.5 footprint and examination of drivers for PM2.5 emissions may be essential for urban pollution mitigation policy.",

Hence, locally suitable Green Index should be devised and incorporated in the urban planning of cities, in spite of the size of the city. This analysis is to showcase the green index for the planning of smart cities. The devised green index is verified in the real-world context of Gulbarga city, India, thereby understanding the practicality of this index. The results show scope for alternative green cover, where ever the green index is low. This technique presents intra-city green cover pattern analysis. Such analysis emphasises to reserve the space for green in urban planning for well-being in totality. The aspect of Land Surface Temperature (LST) analysis and correlating the same with the amount of green cover further enhances the process of promoting green cities. The assessment of per capita green space with the standards of World Health Organisation (WHO) identified the scope of greenery initiatives in various parts of the city.",

In particular, the main goal is to identify services required in such framework to define the requirements and features of a reference architecture to support the data-driven methods for energy efficiency monitoring or load prediction. With this object in mind, a use case of short-term load forecasting in non-residential buildings in the University of Girona is provided, in order to practically explain the services embedded in the described general layers architecture. In the work, classic data-driven models for load forecasting in buildings are used as an example.",

abstract = "In the past decades, the issues related to mobile learning have been widely discussed around the globe; however, the development and trends of applying mobile technologies in nursing education still lack systematic analysis. In this study, a meta review of the studies published in academic journals from 1971 to 2016 was conducted to analyze the application domains, subjects, adopted learning strategies, investigated research issues and findings of mobile technology-supported nursing education. From the review results, it was found that the use of mobile technologies in nursing education and training have made great progress in the past decades. In addition to the changes in mobile technologies and the increasing number of mobile learning studies in nursing education, the subjects and research issues have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that mobile learning has mainly been applied to the training of basic nursing concepts and skills as well as to long-term care and obstetrics and gynecology, while few or even no studies are related to other nursing education domains. In addition, several widely adopted mobile learning strategies, such as inquiry-based learning, contextual mobile learning, snychronous sharing, Mindtools, project-based learning and peer assessment, have seldom been adopted in mobile nursing education. This also reflects the fact that most of these studies focused on skills training and basic knowledge comprehension, while few were conducted in the domains aimed at fostering learners' higher order thinking competences, such as problem solving or critical thinking. On the other hand, it was found that the number of studies using an experimental design has increased in recent years; moreover, most studies reported the learners’ cognitive performance and perceptions, while their learning behaviors were seldom analyzed. Accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of mobile nursing education are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors and policy makers.",

In this article, a model is presented demonstrating how the data released by the smart cities creates value for the citizens and society. The model operates using three stages. The first one shapes the release of data by the smart city, and it includes several of the dimensions that make data appealing for reuse. The second stage analyses the mechanisms to create innovative products and services. The last stage explains how these products and services impact its society.",

Since these systems are embedded in a critical and dynamic environment, it is really important to have an infrastructure that is capable of providing real-time environmental information. This paper discusses two research questions that arise from adaptive ubicomp systems: (i) what are the key requirements to provide a reliable WSN-based system (e.g. a river monitoring system)? and (ii) how can an adaptable and reliable WSN-based system be developed? This paper seeks to respond to the former question with the aid of the RESS standard platform. The latter question is answered by employing a generic approach for adaptation. The term “critical systems”, means that any error may result in the loss of human life. We devised the RESS standard after deploying the WSN-based river monitoring system in Brazil for five years. Our prototype underwent several trials, sometimes leading to failure or damage, before we came up with a more reliable solution, which is outlined in this article. Finally, while our RESS platform is policy-free, it is extensible/adaptable and hence can naturally be adapted to new policies.",

But due to the slow development of a scalable IT infrastructure, this can lead to issues in competitiveness. Software defined networking (SDN) can thereby counteract such issues by giving new functions to the whole network topology. With SDN, administrators have the possibility to abstract the underlying network infrastructure for applications and network services. The paper reports on the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on challenges and effects of SDN. It shows that most papers address the implementation of software defined networking as a challenge, including factors like vendor lock-in and the general risk of changing traditional network architectures. Attention is also given to security issues arising with software defined networks and the permanent high demand from the end-user combined with the fear of changing traditional networks. Issues dealing with specialized know-how were identified as another challenge category. Effects of SDN are discussed by defining unique features of SDN like decoupling hardware from the software and the global view of the whole network architecture. SDN furthermore affects the management of the network, including changes in deployment of policies, the programmability and maintenance of the network. Economic factors, such as cost efficiency and reduction of costs, are also discussed.",

abstract = "The topic of digital manufacturing is increasingly emerging in industry. One of the main scope of data digitalization is achieving more efficient factories. Different techniques and tools under the Industry 4.0 paradigm were already discussed in literature. These are aimed mostly at boosting company efficiency in terms of costs and environmental footprint. However, from a sustainability point of view, the social theme must be equally considered. While energy flows or costs can be already monitored in a production plant, this is not valid for data related to human effort. Monitoring systems aimed at supervising factory social sustainability were not already discussed in literature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to acquire social related data in a production plant. The method is supported by a smart architecture within the concept of IoT factory. Such architecture permits to monitor the parameters that could influence social sustainability in a production site. After a discussion on production plants facilities and features, the parameters that need to be considered to guarantee socially sustainable manufacturing processes are identified. A set of sensors controls these data taken from different sources, including operator vital signs. Operations as well as humans are monitored. Data acquired by sensors are collected by a central server. A decision maker can interpret the data and improve the production system from a social point of view, implementing corrective actions. Data can be exploited not only for social assessments but even for other analyses on the production system. Guaranteeing social sustainability could boost the factory productivity. A case study is included in the paper: smart sensors are implemented in a production line to understand the operations efficiency in terms of social sustainability.",

R&D alone is significantly associated with contemporaneous TFP growth, thus exhibiting indirect effects. Although there is no significant short-run association between ICT and TFP, we find a positive association with a lag of seven to eight years. Thus, R&D affect TFP much faster than ICT-investments. We also divide ICT capital into hardware and software capital. To our knowledge, this distinction has not been made in any previous study analyzing TFP at the industry level. The results show that lagged hardware capital services growth is significantly associated with TFP growth. Hence, investments complementary to hardware are needed to reap the long-run TFP effects from reorganizing production.",

However, in order to ensure a good monitoring, high bandwidth and low delay are needed. The 5G technology offers higher bandwidth, lower delays and packets loss than previous technologies. This paper presents an architecture for smart eHealth monitoring of chronic patients. The architecture elements include wearable devices, to collect measures from the body, and a smartphone at the patient side in order to process the data received from the wearable devices. We also need a DataBase with an intelligent system able to send an alarm when it detects that it is happening something anomalous. The intelligent system uses machine learning in BigData taken from different hospitals and the data received from the patient to diagnose and generate alarms. Experiment tests have been done to simulate the traffic from many users to the DataBase in order to evaluate the suitability of 5G in our architecture. When there are few users (less than 200 users), we do not find big differences of round trip time between 4G and 5G, but when there are more users, like 1000 users, it increases considerably reaching 4 times more in 4G The Packet Loss is almost null in 4G until 300 users, while in 5G it is possible to keep it null until 700 users. Our results point out that in order to have high number of patients continuously monitored, it is necessary to use the 5G network because it offers low delays and guarantees the availability of bandwidth for all users.",

This is the first Asia-wide study of prostate cancer and has developed from single country research efforts in this field, including in Japan and Korea. At the Second Meeting, participating countries and regions discussed the status of preparations and discussed various issues that are being faced. These issues include technical challenges in creating databases, promoting participation in each country or region, clarifying issues relating to data input, addressing institutional issues such as institutional review board requirements, and the need for dedicated data managers. The meeting was positioned as an opportunity to share information and address outstanding issues prior to the initiation of the study.

The objectives of this review were to evaluate the use of consumer-targeted wearable and mobile sleep monitoring technology, identify gaps in the literature and determine the potential for use in behavioral interventions. We undertook a scoping review of studies conducted in adult populations using consumer-targeted wearable technology or mobile devices designed to measure and/or improve sleep. After screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, data were extracted from the articles by two co-authors. Articles included in the search were using wearable or mobile technology to estimate or evaluate sleep, published in English and conducted in adult populations. Our search returned 3897 articles and 43 met our inclusion criteria. Results indicated that the majority of studies focused on validating technology to measure sleep (n = 23) or were observational studies (n = 10). Few studies were used to identify sleep disorders (n = 2), evaluate response to interventions (n = 3) or deliver interventions (n = 5). In conclusion, the use of consumer-targeted wearable and mobile sleep monitoring technology has largely focused on validation of devices and applications compared with polysomnography (PSG) but opportunities exist for observational research and for delivery of behavioral interventions. Multidisciplinary research is needed to determine the uses of these technologies in interventions as well as the use in more diverse populations including sleep disorders and other patient populations.",

These environmental changes could affect product composition, the performance of the building and the health and safety of its occupants. This work demonstrates the characterization of fermented food facilities by continuous monitoring of the environment with a wireless sensor system. The system measures multiple air parameters throughout a building and displays the sensor data graphically in real-time on any web browser-enabled device. Design emphasis was placed on ease of installation, minimal maintenance and convenient access to the data. The system is installed at five facilities, three wineries and two creameries, and enables the managers at these locations to make informed decisions based on measurements of past and current environmental conditions. Data from both types of facilities show the environmental changes as a result of the fermentation process and building operation. In particular, the release of carbon dioxide from the wine and cheese production and the building's ability to remove the carbon dioxide are analyzed",

In some cases of cyberphysical networks, their configuration can be done in a centralized way (e.g., automated production line configuration). However, for socio-cyberphysical networks the centralized control is not possible due to the independence and autonomy of the network members (e.g., employees of an enterprise). The paper proposes an approach to model such network via a set of interacting socio-inspired services. Such services are capable to model behavior of the network participants taking into account their preferences, strategies and social norms. The interoperability of the services is achieved due to the usage of common standards (such as WSDL and SOAP) at the technological level, and common ontology at the semantic level. The developed conceptual model of socio-inspired service is presented together with behavior patterns and methods for their processing.",

The ‘smart city’ concept is linked to an urban research agenda which seeks to embed advances in technology and data collection into the infrastructures of urban environments. Through this neoliberal framework, market-led and technological solutions to city governance and development are prioritised. The urban food movement has a different trajectory compared to the smart city agenda, comprising a diverse mix of urban food production practices, including community and grassroots-based social innovations, and associated more recently with food security discourses. Recognising these ideological and epistemological differences (between the smart city and the urban food movement) is important for conceptualisations of ‘smart food city’ governance. Based on theoretical reflections, review material and findings from a European project on city-region food systems, the paper argues that smart technology can be an important part of the solution to city food challenges but in combination with social innovations to enable flexible modes of governance that are inclusive, technologically and socially-orientated and linked to specific city-region contexts. Key elements include city regionalism, new organisational structures and connectivities, a circular model of metabolism and social practices.",

By closing down massive outdated capability, restricting the industries to denitration, desulfuration, recovering waste heat and slashing carbon emission, the pollutants from the cement industry reduced significantly during the last decades; the cement industry completed a great deal of various solid wastes and contributed to the cleaner production. Various approaches to increase the recycling degree are reviewed and an efficient way is put forward. The alternative cements must be based on high abundance raw materials, low carbon emission, low energy consumption, low pollutants and waste byproducts. Cleaner production, recycling and alternative cement are three effective approaches for the sustainable development of cement industry.",

If successful, the sharing of such resources is likely to have a potentially disruptive impact on incumbents in traditional supply chains. However, given the embryonic state of its development, it is perhaps not surprising that collaborative consumption is not well understood in research or practice. With this in mind, this study undertook a four-stage Delphi study with 25 experts in order to identify the key drivers, inhibitors and likely future developments in collaborative consumption over the next 10years. A key finding was that environmental concern (sustainability) was considered of minor importance. The paper rounds-off with conclusions and implications for practice and further research.",

Meanwhile, we treat PSN as a market, based on the standpoint that data can be priced and tradable. After analyzing its market structure, we describe PSN as a monopolistically competitive market, which contains multiple providers selling specialized goods. Afterwards, we study the social behaviors in this market from an economic perspective, namely applying market models. Finally, decentralized deep reinforcement learning is proposed to estimate users’ patterns and to solve market models, the prisoner's dilemma and the Cournot model to be specific.

This article, which analyses a number of essential elements on this junction, aims to provide a theory on whether, and, if so, how the GDPR affects price discrimination based on the processing of personal data. First, the contribution clarifies the concept of price discrimination, as well as its typology and relevance for big data settings. Subsequent to studying this topic in the context of the Commission's Digital Single Market strategy, the article tests the applicability of the GDPR to online price personalisation practices by applying criteria as ‘personal data’ and ‘automated processing’ to several discriminatory pricing cases and examples. Secondly, the contribution evaluates the possible lawfulness of price personalisation under the GDPR on the basis of consent, the necessity for pre-contractual or contractual measures, and the data controller's legitimate interests. The paper concludes by providing a capita selecta of rights and obligations pertinent to online discriminatory pricing, such as transparency obligations and the right to access, as well as the right to rectify the data on which price discrimination is based, and the right not to be subject to certain discriminatory pricing decisions.",

In this study, potentiometric sensors using either Pt, Al or stainless steel working electrodes were fabricated. Both Pt and stainless steel electrodes exhibited high performance. As an example, a 200mV response was obtained from SUS304 stainless steel electrode exposed to 1mg/L residual chlorine concentration within about 4min. The effects of pH and dissolved oxygen concentration as environmental factors were evaluated, and Pt and SUS316 electrodes showed the same variation with changes in these parameters. The data suggest that the appropriate pairing of electrode materials could allow the fabrication of all-solid-state sensor devices with the advantages of compactness, low power consumption, low cost and robustness.",

A cyber-physical vulnerability impact analysis using decision trees then provides the manufacturer with a stoplight scale between low, medium, and high levels of cyber-physical vulnerability for each analyzed production process. The stoplight scale allows manufacturers to interpret assessment results in an intuitive way. Finally, the paper provides a case study of the proposed approach at an applied manufacturing research facility and provides general recommendations to securing similar facilities from cyber-physical attacks.",

There is a kind of movement for people to consider sustainability in all their daily activities, not only in the acquisition of goods and services but including the care for health. This induces the emergence of a new business model. Any type of production system (PS) should thus consider sustainability in all its activities and a relationship, which includes not only customers but suppliers, and partners involved from conception, design, manufacturing and provide even service after the use and the disposal of the products. Therefore, an evaluation procedure for PS is proposed to monitor four aspects of sustainability, namely: environmental, social, economical and technological. A framework is considered to deal with the concepts of sustainability and to evaluate performance in industrial PSs considering the indicators to qualify and to quantify their sustainability. It adopts the Petri net technique and extensions of the ANSI/ISA95; Cyber Physical System (CPS) and Smart Grid resources are also considered to treat information processing, storage and access flows by each system component and a Cloud Computing System to connect dispersed PSs. In addition, an evaluation process is systematized to support sustainable PSs by the rational use of production resources and the environment, to guarantee the safety of employees and to maintain the economic profitability of the company, thus, making production processes more efficient.",

This study uses a combination of Geographical Information System techniques and Remote Sensing data (MODIS LST and NDVI), as a preliminary investigation, to assess the spatial relationship between UHI, urban greenspace, household income and electricity consumption in Birmingham, UK. It provides simple and repeatable steps, based on freely available datasets, for urban planners, industry, human and physical geographers, and non-specialists to reproduce the analyses. The results show that, the present impact of the UHI is limited and instead highlights the dominance of household income over local climate in explaining consumption patterns across Birmingham.",

Moreover, the system is using sensors in vehicles to provide a user-friendly platform to communicate with users. Now, the exchange of authentication message between authenticated entities are two important issues for successful implementation of a smart vehicular system. In the proposed vehicular system, there are three entities involve namely users, sink and sensor. In the same architecture, there is two set of communication between user to sink and sink to sensor are needed. In short, we have proposed an architecture of data traffic/movement in vehicular sensor network and authenticate the entities. In addition, we have analyzed our protocol with respect to security attacks and found that it is strongly protected against security attacks.

Grounded in economic decentralization theories, the empirical method employed includes analyzing the scores on an SEI “Specialization Promotion Index” per each province alongside several analytics of invention patent data from each province in the seven SEIs newly designated by the central-level government as of 2010. The data is quantitatively analyzed according to four groups of indicators based on the following specialization-relevant concepts: comparative advantages and technological capabilities; economy size and income; technological uncertainty and lifecycles; and latecomer entry into complex technologies where knowledge is most cumulative. The analysis finds that China’s system of economic decentralization has partially worked to ensure provincial industrial policymaking is effective, whereby a notable number of provinces are seemingly pursuing SEI development strategies (in terms of SEI selection and promotion) that may enable catch-up. However, paradoxically, at the same time, the system appears to sometimes facilitate provincial SEI development strategies that are quite risky or even likely ineffective.",

Through an interpretative case study, it seeks to reveal some of the contradictions present in this process and discuss them within the ANT framework. It can be argued that public debate concerning NN has revealed acute internal contradictions between interest groups and created disputes between actors from different levels of this network, which requires a constant rearrangement of positions. The findings of this study suggest the need of socio-ecological transition by fostering social consensus but also dialogue and competition while actively taking economic and industrial constraints and opportunities simultaneously into account. A coherent approach to socio-ecological understanding is an effective means of governing neutrality.",

Electrical and opto-electrical responses of the films have been measured and reported. Surface characterization via scanning electron and atomic force microscopy was used to evaluate the variations in surface roughness of the annealed material versus the amorphous germanium layers. Power spectral density analysis was performed to investigate the effect of laser annealing on the crystalline structure of the germanium samples.

While a variety of treatment options are available, ranging from pharmaceutical drugs to invasive neuromodulation, the clinical effects are inconsistent and often poorly measured. For instance, the lack of remote monitoring has been a major limitation to optimize therapeutic interventions for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). In this work, we focus on the assessment of full-body tremor as the most recognized PD symptom. Forty PD and twenty two healthy participants were recruited. The main assessment tool was an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion capture system to quantify full-body tremor and to separate tremor-dominant from non-tremor-dominant PD patients as well as from healthy controls. We developed a new measure and evaluated its clinical utility by correlating the results with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores as the gold standard. Significant correlation was observed between the UPDRS and the tremor severity scores for the selected tasks. The results suggest that it is feasible and clinically meaningful to utilize the suggested objective tremor score for the assessment of PD patients. Furthermore, this portable assessment tool could potentially be used in the home environment to monitor PD tremor and facilitate optimizing therapeutic interventions.",

Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can.

The identified factors are grouped into three categories: social exclusion (i.e., low income, ICT-avoidance as the norm, lack of motivation and commitment, and physical or mental disability), digital exclusion (i.e., lack of hardware devices and Internet services) and accessibility (which include the division between rural and urban areas, as well as disparities in ICT literacy and information literacy).

Studies on the digital divide, digital exclusion, and barriers to ICT adoption in higher education deal with similar factors, but these are experienced differently in different contexts.

This article assumes the robotics–privacy relationship as a clear illustration of how the technology–society nexus should be regulated in the future.

abstract = "It is clear that big data has numerous potential impacts in many fields. However, few papers discussed its applications in the field of safety science research. Additionally, there exist many problems that cannot be ignored when big data is applied to safety science, most outstanding of which is lack of universal supporting theory that guides how to apply big data to safety science research like methods, principles and approaches, etc. In other terms, it is not enough for big data to be viewed asa strong enabler for safety science applications mainly due to lack of universal and basic theory from the perspective of safety science. Considering the above analyzes, the two key objectives of this paper are: (1) to propose the connotation of safety big data (SBD) and its applying rules, methods and principles, and (2) to put forward some application prospects and challenges of big data to safety science research seen from theoretical research. First, by comparing SBD and traditional safety small data (SSD) from four aspects including theoretical research, typical research method, specific analysis method and processing mode, this paper puts forward the definition and connotation of SBD. Subsequently this paper further summarizes and extracts the application rules and methods of SBD. And then nine principles of SBD are explored and their relationship and application are addressed from the view of theory architecture and working framework in data processing flow. At last, this paper also discusses the potential applications and some hot issues of SBD. Overall, this paper will play an essential role in supporting the application of SBD. In addition, it will fill in the theory gaps in the field of SBD beyond traditional safety statistics, and further enriches the contents of safety science.",

In parallel with occupant survey measurement of indoor air quality (IAQ) parameters was conducted with the developed wireless IAQ sensing kits. The same occupant cohort was surveyed for both systems, as occupants of the conventionally-conditioning office, known as the ‘Previous Office’ later moved into the office conditioned by the novel system, known as the ‘3for2 Office’. We observed that the perceived thermal comfort and air quality satisfaction of the occupants were markedly higher in the 3for2 Office than in the Previous Office. While occupants of the 3for2 Office could raise or lower indoor air temperatures, they appeared to be consistently satisfied with higher indoor air temperatures than that set by the building management of the Previous Office. The primarily Singaporean occupants of the 3for2 Office also felt thermally comfortable even when indoor air velocities in the office were measured to be below 0.1 m/s recommended by Singaporean Standards. The 3for2 Office's ventilation system was designed to supply outdoor air beyond minimal required ventilation rates, which lead to relatively low levels of CO2 and PM2.5 concentrations in the 3for2 office. We believe that higher ventilation rates resulting in lower pollutant concentrations are responsible for a higher-than-average survey score on air quality satisfaction. We also believe that enabling occupants to set air temperature in the space resulted in higher-than-average thermal comfort satisfaction.",

abstract = "Objective
Prosthetic grafts used for lower extremity revascularization and dialysis access fail because of hyperplastic stenosis and thrombosis. Graft surveillance is advocated to monitor function; however, graft failure can occur between episodic examinations. An innovative sensor with wireless, microchip technology allows automated surveillance with assessment of graft function using a “cloud”-based algorithm. We performed proof-of-concept experiments with in vitro and in vivo models to assess the feasibility such a real-time graft surveillance system.
Methods
A self-monitoring graft system was evaluated consisting of a prosthetic conduit of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and a sensor unit, and a microsensor, microelectronics, battery, and remote processor with a monitor. The sensor unit was integrated on the extraluminal surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts without compromise to the lumen of the conduit. The grafts were tested in vitro in a pulsatile, recirculating flow system under physiologic flow parameters. The hemodynamic parameters were varied to assess the ability to obtain wireless signal acquisition reflecting real-time flow properties in vitro. Segments of custom tubing with reduced diameters were inserted into the model to mimic stenosis proximal and distal to the grafts. After characterization of the initial data, the self-monitoring grafts were implanted in an ovine carotid model to assess proof of concept in vivo with 30-day follow-up of signal acquisition as well as arteriographic and histologic analysis.
Results
In vitro flow data demonstrated the device was able to determine factors related to prosthetic graft function under varied hemodynamic flow conditions. Wireless signal acquisition using Bluetooth technology (Bluetooth SIG, Inc, Kirkland, Wash) allowed remote data analysis reflecting graft flow parameters through changes in microsensor voltage and frequency. Waveform analysis was applied to construct an algorithm using proprietary software and determine a parameter for graft flow characteristics. This algorithm allowed determination of the degree of stenosis and location of stenosis location (proximal or distal) for display on a remote monitor in real time. Subsequent in vivo experiments confirmed the ability of the system to generate signal acquisition through skin and soft tissue under biologic conditions with no arteriographic stenosis and a favorable healing response at 30-day harvest.
Conclusions
Initial in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the ability for a self-monitoring graft system to remotely monitor hemodynamic parameters reflecting graft function using wireless data transmission. This automated system shows promise to deliver real-time data that can be analyzed by cloud-based algorithms alerting the clinician of a change in graft function or development of stenosis for further diagnostic study or intervention before graft failure.",

It constitutes, thus, a valuable case of development and diffusion of effective user-centric privacy enhancing technologies and a first tool to allow individuals to enjoy the immaterial wealth of their personal data in the data economy. Indeed, a free portability of personal data from one controller to another can be a strong tool for data subjects in order to foster competition of digital services and interoperability of platforms and in order to enhance controllership of individuals on their own data. However, the adopted formulation of the right to data portability in the GDPR could benefit from further clarification: several interpretations are possible, particularly with regard to the object of the right and its interrelation with other rights, potentially leading to additional challenges within its technical implementation. The aim of this article is to propose a first systematic interpretation of this new right, by suggesting a pragmatic and extensive approach, particularly taking advantage as much as possible of the interrelationship that this new legal provision can have with regard to the Digital Single Market and the fundamental rights of digital users. In sum, the right to data portability can be approximated under two different perspectives: the minimalist approach (the adieu scenario) and the empowering approach (the fusing scenario), which the authors consider highly preferable.",

However, recent advances in electronic healthcare systems allow transmission of sensitive information through the Internet, which is prone to various vulnerabilities, attacks and may leads to unauthorized disclosure. Such situations may not only create adverse effects for individuals but may also cause severe consequences such as hefty regulatory fines, bad publicity, legal fees, and forensics. To avoid such predicaments, a privacy protected healthcare system is proposed in this study that protects the identity of an individual as well as detects vocal fold disorders. The privacy of the developed healthcare system is based on the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm, which embeds a watermark in a secret key instead of the signals to avoid the distortion in an audio sample. The identity is protected by the generation of its secret shares through visual cryptography. The generated shares are embedded by finding the patterns into the audio with the application of one-dimensional local binary pattern. The proposed zero-watermarking algorithm is evaluated by using audio samples taken from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary voice disorder database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves imperceptibility and is reliable in its extraction of identity. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not affect the results of disorder detection and it is robust against noise attacks of various signal-to-noise ratios.",

With the advent of IoT and the associated variety of pervasive and context-aware applications, there is an increasing requirement to support the execution of these applications on devices with limited processing power. This is a cost-intensive process as this usually requires the deployment of centralized computing infrastructure accessible via a cloud interface. We envision a distributed execution environment comprised of diverse computing resources as an alternative solution to this problem. This execution environment can be defined as a mobile cloud. However, the inherent unreliability of the mobile cloud requires developers to add reliability within the applications separately making the development process tedious. In this position paper, we present Aegis - a framework that provides a reliable and unified computing platform with built-in failure detection and repair mechanisms. Aegis draws upon the actor based execution model as well as stream processing applications to provide a reliable overlay over unreliable environments. Aegis also relives developers of the task of adding reliability mechanisms to applications separately.",

The emerging prototype for a Smart City is one of an urban environment with a new generation of innovative services for transportation, energy distribution, healthcare, environmental monitoring, business, commerce, emergency response, and social activities. Enabling the technology for such a setting requires a viewpoint of Smart Cities as cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that include new software platforms and strict requirements for mobility, security, safety, privacy, and the processing of massive amounts of information. This paper identifies some key defining characteristics of a Smart City, discusses some lessons learned from viewing them as CPSs, and outlines some fundamental research issues that remain largely open.",

The main issues comprise privacy, data protection, liability, autonomy, dignity, and ethics. The paper first discusses the need to take into account other interdisciplinary aspects of robot technology to offer complete legal coverage to citizens. As the European Union starts using impact assessment methodology for completing new technologies regulations, a new methodology based on it to approach the insertion of personal care robots will be discussed. Then, after framing the discussion with a use case, analysis of the involved legal challenges will be conducted. Some concrete scenarios will contribute to easing the explanatory analysis.",

The message of the paper is that sustainability requires a significant input from Ergonomics/Human Factors, but the profession needs some expansion in its thinking in order to make this contribution. Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption). Appropriate changes are already being implemented in manufacturing industry, including new business models, new jobs and new skills. Considerable high-level planning around the world is in progress and is bringing about these changes; for example, there is the US ‘Advanced Manufacturing National Program’ (AMNP)’, the German ‘Industrie 4.0’ plan, the French plan ‘la nouvelle France industrielle’ and the UK Foresight publications on the ‘Future of Manufacturing’. All of these activities recognise the central part that humans will continue to play in the new manufacturing paradigms; however, they do not discuss many of the issues that systems ergonomics professionals acknowledge. This paper discusses a number of these issues, highlighting the need for some new thinking and knowledge capture by systems ergonomics professionals. Among these are ethical issues, job content and skills issues. Towards the end, there is a summary of knowledge extensions considered necessary in order that systems ergonomists can be fully effective in this new environment, together with suggestions for the means to acquire and disseminate the knowledge extensions.",

Our review of commercial solutions involved the analysis of 141 international software packages, categorized into 11 functions. Cluster analysis was used to group current commercial FMIS as well as examine possible avenues for further development. Academic FMIS involved more sophisticated systems covering compliance to standards applications, automated data capture as well as interoperability between different software packages. Conversely, commercial FMIS applications targeted everyday farm office tasks related to budgeting and finance, such as recordkeeping, machinery management, and documentation, with emerging trends showing new functions related to traceability, quality assurance and sales.",

Different approaches have been followed as new security threats have emerged in the last few years. The approach of conditional privacy has been widely used as it guarantees authentication among vehicles but not revealing their real identities. Although the real identity of a vehicle can be traced by the authorities, the process to do that is time consuming and typically involves several entities (for instance road authorities that request the identification, license plate records bodies, a judge to allow revealing the identity associated to a license plate…). Moreover, this process is always subsequent to the detection of a road situation that requires knowing the real vehicle identities. However, in vehicular scenarios, authorities would beneficiate from knowing the real drivers’ identity in advance. We propose in this paper On-SiteDriverID, a secure protocol and its application which allows authorities’ vehicles to obtain drivers’ real identities rapidly and on demand on VANET scenarios. Thus, authorities would be able to gather information about drivers and vehicles, allowing them to act in a safer and better manner in situations such as traffic control duties or emergencies. The obtained simulation results in real VANET scenarios based on real maps guarantee that in the 60%–70% of cases the proposed On-SiteDriverID successfully obtains the identity of the drivers.",

While most evidence suggests that ICTs continue to provide the back-bone of economic activities, there is the prospect that biotechnology will eventually start to fulfil the promise envisaged over 30 years ago in the film Blade Runner.",

abstract = "Wider availability of sensors and sensing systems has pushed research in the direction of automatic activity recognition (AR) either for medical or other personal benefits e.g. wellness or fitness monitoring. Researchers apply different AR techniques/algorithms and use a wide range of sensors to discover home activities. However, it seems that the AR algorithms are purely technology-driven rather than informing studies on the type and quality of input required. There is an expectation to over-instrument the environment or the subjects and then develop AR algorithms, where instead the problem should be approached from a different angle i.e. what sensors (type, quality and quantity) a given algorithm requires to infer particular activities with a certain confidence? This paper introduces the concept of activity recognition, its taxonomy and familiarises the reader with sub-classes of sensor-based AR. Furthermore, it presents an overview of existing health services Telecare and Telehealth solutions, and introduces the hierarchical taxonomy of human behaviour analysis tasks. This work is a result of a systematic literature review and it presents the reader with a comprehensive set of home-based activities of daily living (ADL) and sensors proven to recognise these activities. Apart from reviewing usefulness of various sensing technologies for home-based AR algorithms, it highlights the problem of technology-driven cycle of development in this area.",

abstract = "The growth of the mobile data services market is no longer dependent on push strategies from suppliers. On the contrary, demand is now driving the market to the extent that it will not be easy for mobile operating companies to cope up with the demand to come in the near future. Operators are forced to make heavy investments to upgrade and expand their networks, which then squeezes profits, as the evolution of income is not parallel to that of demand. On the other hand, the operators simply cannot refuse to take up the challenge. To decide how to handle the present and upcoming demand, they need to identify and understand the characteristics of the scenarios they face and will be facing. This is precisely the aim of this article, which provides figures on the consequences for mobile infrastructures of a generalised mobile data services uptake. To achieve this, the article collects information about the predicted evolution of different mobile services in the current and coming years and translates those expectations into service requirements. The paper closes with a discussion on the feasibility and the techno-economic implications for practical deployment, imposed by these requisites. Data from the Spanish mobile deployment case have been used to arrive at practical figures and illustration of results, but the conclusions are easily extended to other countries and regions.",

Furthermore, we are concerned with the allocation of equipment in such a way to provide the best performance. We observed a problem related to the overall optimization of the system, in which case the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) proved to be very effective. In order to address this problem, we first developed an analytical model, in which we could compare the SINR (Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio) values before and after the application of the clustering model and, later, in order to validate the model, we executed simulations and evaluated the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. We noticed significant improvements in the SINR, achieving about 80% of the Small Cells and keeping the battery consumption behavior stable. Through the simulations, we observed improvements in the quality of the service offered to the users, such as the reduction in the lag above 33%, as well as a drop in the number of lost packets.",

Second, the expensive computations for the ABE decryption process is partially delegated to a Semi Trusted Cloud Server. Third, users’ privacy is protected thanks to a hidden access policy. Fourth, PHOABE is proven to be selectively secure, verifiable and policy privacy preserving under the random oracle model.

In this paper, founding upon the facts that the key indicators of EEQ from the experts’ selections are hidden in and improved by the constantly additions of new publications, a new approach of deriving indicators and comprehensive measure for ecological environmental quality assessment (EEQA) is developed from dynamic co-word network. We elaborate the new approach and the modeling construction roadmap: the key indicators of EEQ emerge from the dynamic co-word network; basing on clustering and K-core analysis of the co-word network domains, four levels of indicators for EEQA are deduced; based on the similarity or relatedness between the indicators in the co-word network, nodal degrees are introduced to calculate indicators’ weights and derive a comprehensive measure for EEQ, finally forming a rigorous co-word network model of EEQA. This model is applied to some typical cases of EEQA (a town, a city and two specific cases from Chongqing and Beijing) and the reasonable assessment results are obtained. The results are compared with other models to show the features of the model. The co-word network model for EEQA is a potential and universal function derived from traditional co-word methods of bibliometrics. Beyond the EEQA, the assessment of many other complex phenomena can be similarly conducted in terms of the given technical roadmap.",

abstract = "Context
Service-oriented computing and context-aware computing are two consolidated paradigms that are changing the way of providing and consuming software services. Whilst service-oriented computing is based on service-oriented architectures for providing flexible software services, context-aware computing articulates different phases of a context life cycle for changing the behavior of such services. The synergy between both paradigms provides the context to this study.
Objective
This study analyzes the current state of the art of context models, specifically: (1) which are these proposals and how are they related; (2) what are their structural characteristics; (3) what context information is the most addressed; and (4) what are their most consolidated definitions. Given their dominance on the field, the study focuses on ontology-based approaches.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping by establishing a review protocol that integrates automatic and manual searches from different sources. We applied a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the papers to evaluate.
Results
Overall, 138 primary studies were selected to answer our research questions. These proposals were studied in depth by analyzing: 1) distribution along time and their relationships; 2) size correlated with the number of classes and levels of the context model, and coverage of the definitions provided as indicator of quality provided; 3) most addressed context information; 4) most consolidated definitions of context information.
Conclusions
The contribution of this survey is to make available a unified and consolidated body of knowledge on context for service-oriented computing that could be instantiated and used as starting point in a variety of use cases. This sweeping view on the anatomy of context models may help avoiding the postulation of new proposals not aligned with the current research.",

Create a visual mobile end user development framework, named Puzzle, which allows end users without IT background to create, modify and execute applications, and provides support for interaction with smart things, phone functions and web services.
Methods
Design of an intuitive visual metaphor and associated interaction techniques for supporting end user development in mobile devices with iterative empirical validation.
Results
Our results show that the jigsaw is an intuitive metaphor for development in a mobile environment and our interaction techniques required a limited cognitive effort to use and learn the framework. Integration of different modalities and usage of smart things was relevant for users.
Conclusion
Puzzle has addressed the main objective. The framework further contributes to the research on mobile end user development in order to create an incentive for users to go beyond consuming content and applications to start creating their own applications.
Practice
Usage of a mobile end user development environment has the potential to create a shift from the conventional few-to-many distribution model of software to a many-to-many distribution model. Users will be able to create applications that fit their requirements and share their achievements with peers.
Implications
This study has indicated that the Puzzle visual environment has the potential to enable users to easily create applications and stimulate exploration of innovative scenarios through smartphones.",

In order to respond to this emergent criticality, the principles of green economy have been introduced in the European policy discussion to achieve a good compromise between the sustainability and the profitability of productions by increasing the efficiency of farming operations. Such approach poses some technical and financial challenges for small-sized enterprises because they generally do not possess adequate internal knowledge, nor they can acquire external expertise due to their budget restrictions. Decision Support Systems (DSS) can be an effective solution to overcome such difficulties, since they can involve experts’ knowledge and complex mathematical elaborations on contextual data, thus helping managers in taking more effective decisions. Based on these motivations, the paper proposes a methodological approach to the development of a DSS in the specific context of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) applied to intensive (greenhouse) production, and an experimental validation based on real data. The DSS involves a rule-based decision approach based on referenced mathematical models applied to the information gathered by a sensor network. The multi sensor decision fusion methodology proposed represents an innovative contribution to the literature and an easy-to use and low cost solution to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in protected crops.",

The development of participatory innovation models and collective intelligence offer new insights for conducting research on factors enabling corporate entrepreneurship. In particular, the internal company ‘crowd’ can be investigated with the purpose to study the conditions under which the corporate entrepreneurship process can be successfully nurtured and conducted. In such view, this article moves from an extended review of corporate entrepreneurship and organizational innovation literature to define the concept of crowdventuring and to present an assessment tool aimed to evaluate the maturity of the crowdventuring process within an organization. The tool, which captures both individual and organization-related factors, is also used for an illustrative application into a multinational IT company.

Non-adherence is caused by several factors among which three play an important role: Treatment complexity, cognitive decline, and patient-provider communication. This article presents an ongoing multidisciplinary project, the CONSIGNELA project, which adopts a patient-centered approach for improving medication adherence in these patients. The first objective of the project is to identify the best way to communicate medication prescriptions with tablets and touch-screen devices. The second objective is to improve medication adherence by creating a collaborative application (app) designed both for older and PD patients and for healthcare professionals in charge of them. Two solutions are combined: A cognitive and a technological solutions. The cognitive solution consists in studying in real time older and PD patients while consulting and executing prescriptions presented in different formats to select the most efficient one. The technological solution aims to improve collaboration between health professionals and patients by developing System of Systems (SoS). The research model used in the project includes three phases. Only the results of phase 1 are presented in the article. A research app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-R was programmed to analyze patient cognitive processes while consulting a prescription on a tablet. A pilot study was carried out with young adults to test it. It confirmed a facilitating effect of table format. In parallel, the prototype of a second app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-P, for patients and healthcare providers was developed. It is based on an SoS architecture connecting a virtual pillbox, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and a knowledge platform. The virtual pillbox is used by patients and providers to improve mutual understanding of medication prescriptions. The MAS provides agents that extract and analyze indicators, actions and information resulting from the interaction between patients and virtual pillboxes. All the information is capitalized and stored in the knowledge platform. Providers can receive charts and dashboards showing information about the following of the medication regimen, for instance, if patients are following it correctly or not.",

abstract = "It's becoming harder for information security and risk professionals to locate, track and protect sensitive and company confidential data, while ensuring compliance to data residency and privacy regulations. Modern data security strategies need to consider two layers – where data is being stored and organised and where data is being retrieved and used. Data integration works alongside traditional security technologies so that organisations can secure sensitive information appropriately, explains Julie Lockner of Informatica. Cyber-security woes continue to burden the minds of organisations of all sizes. In reaction to consumer concern, the National Crime Agency (NCA) is kicking off a campaign in the UK, designed to highlight the dangers of not being protected online, and to encourage computer, mobile and tablet users to download and update their security software. This campaign demonstrates the continued security concerns the consumer industry is experiencing – however, enterprise organisations must continue to be on their guard too.",

The current Internet paradigm, which is infrastructure-centric, is not the right one to cope with such emerging scenario with a wider range of applications. This calls for a radically new Internet paradigm, that we name the Internet of People (IoP), where the humans and their personal devices are not seen merely as end users of applications, but become active elements of the Internet. Note that IoP is not a replacement of the current Internet infrastructure, but it exploits legacy Internet services as (reliable) primitives to achieve end-to-end connectivity on a global-scale. In this visionary paper, we first discuss the key features of the IoP paradigm along with the underlying research issues and challenges. Then we present emerging networking and computing paradigms that are anticipating IoP.",

abstract = "Among the potential roadmaps towards sustainable production, the emerging energy-cost-aware production scheduling philosophy is considered as one promising direction. Therein, sustainability objectives, e.g., minimization of energy consumption/cost of production processes and stabilization of the electricity grid, can be achieved by manufacturing enterprises in a low-cost manner. However, these sustainability goals should be integrated with conventional production constraints besides the due date, e.g., reasonable labor cost based on work shifts, no production at weekends, and changeovers for different product types. This paper formulates a mixed-integer linear programming model for energy- and labor-cost-aware production scheduling at the unit process level, considering all the aforementioned constraints. A state-based energy model is used to reveal the energy consumption behavior of a process over time. It thus enables fine-grained energy-aware production scheduling. A case study is conducted for a blow molding process in a Belgian plastic bottle manufacturer. The measured power data enables to build an empirical energy model. The production scheduling is performed under real-time electricity pricing data. As a result, production loads are automatically shifted to the optimal periods. The optimal idle mode is automatically selected between production loads (powering off, idle, etc.). A schedule of joint energy cost and labor cost minimization is demonstrated to reduce 12% and 5% of total cost, compared to schedules that minimize energy and labor cost, respectively. In conclusion, although the labor wage is usually higher during periods with lower electricity price, energy and labor costs can be jointly optimized as a single objective to help factories minimize the production expenditure.",

abstract = "Context: Big Data systems are a class of software systems that ingest, store, process and serve massive amounts of heterogeneous data, from multiple sources. Despite their undisputed impact in current society, their engineering is still in its infancy and companies find it difficult to adopt them due to their inherent complexity. Existing attempts to provide architectural guidelines for their engineering fail to take into account important Big Data characteristics, such as the management, evolution and quality of the data. Objective: In this paper, we follow software engineering principles to refine the λ-architecture, a reference model for Big Data systems, and use it as seed to create Bolster, a software reference architecture (SRA) for semantic-aware Big Data systems. Method: By including a new layer into the λ-architecture, the Semantic Layer, Bolster is capable of handling the most representative Big Data characteristics (i.e., Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability and Veracity). Results: We present the successful implementation of Bolster in three industrial projects, involving five organizations. The validation results show high level of agreement among practitioners from all organizations with respect to standard quality factors. Conclusion: As an SRA, Bolster allows organizations to design concrete architectures tailored to their specific needs. A distinguishing feature is that it provides semantic-awareness in Big Data Systems. These are Big Data system implementations that have components to simplify data definition and exploitation. In particular, they leverage metadata (i.e., data describing data) to enable (partial) automation of data exploitation and to aid the user in their decision making processes. This simplification supports the differentiation of responsibilities into cohesive roles enhancing data governance.",

Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications.",

However, in healthcare, such practices, beyond elicitation, are immature. The introduction of changes to existing healthcare processes or e-systems often fails because users’ needs and operational/organizational goals may not get satisfied. In addition, healthcare is moving toward a value-based paradigm that requires a comprehensive evaluation and re-engineering of current processes, which puts more pressure on healthcare professionals to apply advanced RE techniques, such as goal and process modeling, in order to obtain much desired results effectively. In this paper, we discuss the integration of new technology-depending processes, e.g., that come with off-the-shelf solutions, with existing healthcare processes. We propose the use of an Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) framework to investigate the impact of each potential integration on the organizational goals and user satisfaction. Performance indicators are used to reason about measurable quantities beyond goal satisfaction. The paper implements the AbPI approach with the User Requirement Notation standard and illustrates its feasibility with a real example related to wait time indication in an emergency room.

However, cyber threats are also becoming various and sophisticated, which will endanger the security of users’ private data. In traditional service mode, users’ data is totally stored in the cloud, they lose the right of control on their data and face cyber threats such as data loss and malicious modification. To this end, we propose a novel cloud storage scheme based on fog computing. In our scheme, user’s private data is separately stored in the cloud and fog servers. By this way, the integrity, availability and confidentiality of user’s data can be ensured because the data is retrieved from cloud as well as fog, which is safer. We implement a system prototype and design a series of mechanisms. Extensive experiments results also validate the proposed scheme and methods.",

However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers’ attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers’ behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions.",

Hospitals started to employ business intelligence systems (BIS) to extract correct, timely, and useful information for hospital decision-makers. Most studies in the area focus on the establishment and related benefits of BIS. This research aims to evaluate the BIS maturity and its influences on decision quality to reveal the BIS impacts on hospital agility. To test the research model, opinions were collected by distributing questionnaires to clinical and administrative decision-makers who had experiences of using BIS in hospitals. The results showed that medical information quality was significantly influenced by BIS maturity. Furthermore, medical information quality exerted a significant effect on medical decision quality, BIS usage, and user satisfaction. The positive influence of user satisfaction on medical decision quality is also verified.",

abstract = "The depletion of oil and gas reserves is bringing up economic, political and social issues which encourage the adoption of renewable, green energy sources. Wind energy is a major source of renewable energy because of the maturity and competitive costs of technological solutions to exploit this type of green energy. This kind of power generation is achieved through the use of wind turbines, which convert translational kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. The benefits already proven of this type of renewable energy source have motivated nations worldwide to adopt policies to improve the use of wind energy in order to minimize their dependence on oil and natural gas. However, the adoption of wind turbines poses several challenges. A key challenge is properly and timely identifying structural damages which affect the structural health of the wind turbine. In this context, we propose a damage prediction system for wind turbines based on wireless sensor and actuator network. The proposed system, called Delphos, is a decentralized system where all decision-making process is performed within the network, in a collaborative way by the nodes. The purpose of Delphos is to accurately predict when the turbine will reach a damage state, thus allowing timely actions on the turbine operation to prevent accidents, reducing maintenance costs and delays in the power generation. Delphos relies on a time series forecasting model, called ARIMA, and a fuzzy system to eliminate the influence of temperature in the process of damage prediction.",

First, a barn is segmented into delimited areas (e.g. cubicles) with which an activity can be associated (e.g. resting), then a real-time location system (RTLS) can be used to automatically convert cow position into behaviour. Working within the EU-PLF project, we tested a system already able to determine basic activities (resting, moving, eating…) and logged a “big data” set of billions of data points (123 days × 190 cows × 1 location-per-second readings). We then focused on integrating image analysis techniques to help visualise and analyse the dataset, first to validate the data and then to enrich the information extracted. The algorithm developed using freely available tools quickly confirmed the ability of the system to determine cows' main activities (except drinking behaviour), even with 11% of positions missing. The good localisation precision (16 cm) made it possible to enrich the time-budget with new activities such as using brushes and licking mineral blocks. For both activities, using visual observations as gold standard, activity profiles with excellent sensitivity (nearly 80%) were extracted. This validation procedure is both necessary and generalisable to other situations. The improvement of biological information contained in such data holds promise for people designing alarm devices and health and welfare indicators for farmers and/or vets.",

As far as many Western countries have realized some of those investments during recent decades and have more experience in that field, most of the countries in Central Europe have to face that challenge right now. However, a rapid increase in renewable energy production in those countries can cause some dysfunctions in the investment process. National control authorities in Poland marked that the decision-making process concerning the location of wind turbines has not been carried out properly. The paper presents a review of the studies regarding the use of spatial analysis in renewable energy policy implementation and a proposition for the use of the multi-criteria spatial decision support system based on Geographical Information Systems. The presented model has a character of an open framework which allows a user to add any location parameter or factor which is possible to be represented as a metric value. The spatial character of the proposed solution exceeds only mathematical models in the way of interpretation of the results. An intuitive model supports communication with stakeholders and helps to explain the correlations between human activity and the location of power plants. The model was tested on the case study of Wrocław agglomeration area (Poland) and includes 13 location factors. The use of a multi-criteria model guaranteed a broader point of view in comparing five different scenarios of wind farms development in the decision-making process, as it combines conflicted interests groups, minimalizes subjective assessment and enables to define priorities while setting weights of factors.",

Conventional outcome measures (COMs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) refer to rating scales, questionnaires, patient diaries and clinically-based tests that do not require specialized equipment.
Methods
It is timely at this juncture - as clinicians and researchers begin to grapple with the “invasion” of digital technologies - to review the strengths and weaknesses of these outcome measures.
Results
This paper discusses advances (including an enhanced understanding of PD itself, and the development of clinimetrics as a field) that have led to improvements in the COMs used in PD; their strengths and limitations; and factors to consider when selecting and using a measuring instrument.
Conclusions
It is envisaged that in the future, a combination of COMs and technology-based objective measures will be utilized, with different methods having their own strengths and weaknesses. Judgement is required on the part of the clinician and researcher in terms of which instrument(s) are appropriate to use, depending on the particular clinical or research setting or question.",

To deal with these incomplete data, a new kernel function with asymmetric intrinsic mappings is proposed in this study. Such a new kernel uses three-side similarities for kernel matrix formation. The similarity between a testing instance and a training sample relies not only on their distance but also on the relation between the testing sample and the centroid of the class, where the training sample belongs. This reduces biased estimation compared with typical methods when only one training sample is used for kernel matrix formation. Furthermore, centroid generation does not involve any clustering algorithms. The proposed kernel is capable of performing data imputation by using class-dependent averages. This enhances Fisher Discriminant Ratios and data discriminability. Experiments on two open databases were carried out for evaluating the proposed method. The result indicated that the accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of the baseline. These findings thereby demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed idea.",

For this task, sensor networks are a promising tool, although they require the use of sensors with special features, such as those of Ion Selective Electrodes (ISEs). Unfortunately, their measurements are – to a greater or lesser extent – affected by the presence of other coexisting (interfering) ions. A new methodology is then proposed in this work to deal with major interferences (chloride and bicarbonate in the case of nitrate determination), in such a way that the results obtained in the measurements of the content of NO3− with a nitrate selective electrode can be considered as virtually error-free from these interferences. For this purpose, a new sensor node has been developed; it consists of three ISEs (NO3−, Cl−, and HCO3−) coupled to a low-consumption, low-cost microcontroller (a small chip containing all the computer components), which receives and processes all signals coming from the electrodes. This information is suitably treated, as described in detail in this paper, to provide an accurate estimation of the true value of NO3− concentration. The application of this methodology results in an interference-tolerant nitrate smart sensor capable of being employed within a Wireless Sensor Network in the continuous monitoring of nitrate concentration in aquifers and rivers.",

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one of the cultural algorithms for solving many hard problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). ACO is a natural behaviour of ants, which work stochastically with the help of pheromone trails deposited in the shortest route to find their food. This optimization procedure involves adapting, positive feedback and inherent parallelism. Each ant will deposit certain amount of pheromone in the tour construction it makes searching for food. This type of communication is known as stigmetric communication. In addition, if a dense WBAN environment prevails, such as hospital, i.e. in the environment of overlapping WBAN, game formulation was introduced for analyzing the mixed strategy behaviour of WBAN. In this paper, the ant colony optimization approach to the travelling salesman problem was applied to the WBAN to determine the shortest route for sending emergency message to the doctor via sensor nodes; and also a static Bayesian game formulation with mixed strategy was analysed to enhance the network lifetime. Whenever the patient needs any critical care or any other medical issue arises, emergency messages will be created by the WBAN and sent to the doctor's destination. All the modes of communication were realized in a simulation environment using OMNet++. The authors investigated a balanced model of emergency message dissemination and network lifetime in WBAN using ACO and Bayesian game formulation.",

However, due to excess nutrient loading in water bodies (e.g. agricultural runoff and industrial activities), harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become an increasing issue globally, and can even cause health effects in humans due to the release of cyanotoxins. Among currently available treatment methods, sonication has received increasing attention for algal control because of its low impact on ecosystems and the environment. The effects of ultrasound on algal cells are well understood and operating parameter such as frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure has been well studied. However, most studies have been limited to laboratory data interpretation due to complicated environmental conditions in the field. Only a few field and pilot tests in small reservoirs were reported and the applicability of ultrasound for HABs prevention and control is still under question. There is a lack of information on the upscaling of ultrasonication devices for HAB control on larger water bodies, considering field influencing factors such as rainfall, light intensity/duration, temperature, water flow, nutrients loading, and turbidity. In this review article, we address the challenges and field considerations of ultrasonic applications for controlling algal blooms. An extensive literature survey, from the fundamentals of ultrasound techniques to recent ultrasound laboratory and field studies, has been thoroughly conducted and summarized to identify future technical expectations for field applications. Case studies investigating spatial distribution of frequency and pressure during sonication are highlighted with future implications.",

Here we explore the relationship between microbial ecology and information science in the era of cloud-based computation. We consider microorganisms as individual information processing units implementing a distributed metabolic algorithm and describe developments in ecoinformatics and ubiquitous computing with the potential to eliminate bottlenecks and empower knowledge creation and translation.",

Thus, monitoring for failure of these systems is crucial to prevent future impacts to life and property. Participatory assessment technique for infrastructure provides a community-based approach to assess the capacity and physical condition of infrastructure. Furthermore, a participatory assessment technique for infrastructure can encourage grassroots activism that engages residents, researchers, and planners in the identification of sustainable development concerns and solutions. As climate change impacts disproportionately affect historically disenfranchised communities, assessment data can further inform planning, aiming to balance the distribution of public resources towards sustainability and justice. This paper explains the development of the participatory assessment technique for infrastructure that can provide empirical data about the condition of infrastructure at the neighborhood-level, using stormwater systems in a vulnerable neighborhood in Houston, Texas as a case study. This paper argues for the opportunity of participatory methods to address needs in infrastructure assessment and describes the ongoing project testing the best use of these methods.",

The objective of this research is to implement lightweight ciphers in hardware; and optimize and model their design metrics. Design metrics are measured by advanced design flow which includes implementing ciphers in hardware and conducting simulations. To achieve the stated objective, the presented study selects one representative cipher–namely the KATAN/KTANTAN algorithms–to be modeled, implemented and optimized on specific hardware technology; the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. Various designs are implemented to exercise numerous options e.g. block sizes, number of implemented rounds and key scheduling. Then, design metrics are measured and modeled. In general, results demonstrate that number of resources and measured power consumption exhibit similar, but not identical, profile against design options. Measured energy trends are more complex. Specifically, results show that employing variable key scheduling increases resources, power and energy by 30%, 42% and 58%, respectively. Further, increasing the block size by 50% increases resources and power by about 53% and 55% respectively, but reduces energy by an average of 10%. Doubling number of implemented rounds in hardware increases resources and power by an average of 43% and 38% respectively. Optimum energy per bit design is produced in the designs with small block size (i.e. 32-bit) in the cases when number of implemented rounds equals to 32 or 64 rounds. When the energy and area design requirements are to be balanced, the optimum design is the 16-round implementation. Furthermore, developed models are tested on HIGHT cipher and demonstrate good accuracy.",

In the residential setting, the enhanced features and services provided by said computing devices constitute what is typically referred to as a “smart home”. However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues. This paper presents XSACd, a cross-domain resource sharing & access control framework for smart environments, combining the well-studied fine-grained access control provided by the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). Based on standardized technologies, it enables seamless interactions and fine-grained policy-based management of heterogeneous smart devices, including support for communication between distributed networks, via the associated MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT)–based proxies. The framework is implemented in full, and its performance is evaluated on a test bed featuring relatively resource-constrained smart platforms and embedded devices, verifying the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

Major contributions and research orientations of ICT technologies are elaborated based on selected key issues and lessons learned. First, the semantic mediator is proposed as a key enabler for dealing with semantic interoperability. Second, the context-aware infrastructures are proposed as a main solution for making efficient use of EIS to offer a high level of customization of delivered services and data. Third, the product avatar is proposed as a contribution to an evolutionary social, collaborative and product-centric and interaction metaphor with EIS. Fourth, human learning solutions are considered to develop individual competences in order to cope with new technological advances. The paper ends with a discussion on the impact of the proposed solutions on the economic and social landscape and proposes a set of recommendations as a perspective towards next generation of information systems.",

We indicate how new narratives for innovation may include different perspectives and sources of knowledge, including heterodox economics, bio-economics, science and technology studies, and Post-Normal Science. The replacement of policy narratives, however, is not achieved through science speaking truth to power. If that were the case, policies would have changed a long time ago. The present analysis and discussion illustrates how the challenge of replacement is itself one that calls for a reflexive understanding of the relationship between knowledge, belief and agency in complex research and innovation (R&I) systems.",

In this study, we propose and design a low-cost and widely deployable strategy for empowering emergency rescuers through an intelligent mobile psychological self-help tool. This tool will help reduce the gap between the limited number of qualified professional counsellors and the high demand for timely psychological support by rescuers. We start with a thorough investigation of user requirements, extant work, and relevant IS design theories to inform our system design choices, among which we identified that “virtual advisor identity” (VAI) needs further research. We then empirically examined how VAI influences the empowerment effect of ERMS. Involving 120 emergency rescuers who have just finished rescue tasks, our experiment shows that VAI has important effects on a user’s cognitive and emotional routes, which are significant empowering enablers that lead to positive empowerment outcomes. Interestingly, virtual peer advisor empowers users mostly through evoking emotional resonance from them, whereas virtual expert advisor is better at empowering users through cognitive channels. Important theoretical and practical implications of the findings are then discussed.",

Each year, 12 million light vehicles plus 1 million HDOR vehicles reach their end-of-life. In a context of circular economy, following questions are of growing concern. To what extent is the circular economy achieved and implemented in the automotive and HDOR sectors? What industrial practices and regulations are prevalent and commendable in the light of the circular economy? While the end-of-life management of light vehicles − subjected to the ELV Directive 2000/53/EC – is widely studied in literature, the end-of-life stage of HDOR vehicles has been neglected for a long time from a research perspective. To fill this gap, extensive literature survey and in-depth investigations on the industrial ground are conducted. Key factors – i.e. regulations, business models and markets evolution, new and emerging technologies integration – affecting the circular economy performance of automotive and HDOR sectors are analysed. Notably, not only lessons learned from best industrial practices but also remaining challenges for a more circular economy are highlighted. Both industries are compared through the four buildings blocks of the circular economy and the four possible feedback loops defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. As a result, this research contribution could lead to practical applications, for instance, in supporting industrial practitioners or policy makers to realize the opportunities and challenges of closing the loops of HDOR vehicles from different perspectives.",

Skin temperature, through its heat-transfer properties, plays a significant role in the thermoregulation principle that governs thermal comfort. This paper presents a method termed as Predicted Thermal State (PTS) model, which uses the peripheral skin temperature and its gradient features from a single body location to evaluate the thermal state. The model introduces a novel normalization process to resolve both inter and intra individual differences by incorporating body surface area and clothing insulation, respectively. Human subject experiments were conducted, during which each subject's skin temperatures and respective thermal sensation surveys were recorded while environmental conditions varied from cold/cool-to-neutral levels (18–27°C). This study revealed that the combined information of skin temperature and its gradient carry significant potential to establish the thermal state. Four model input cases were compared using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classifiers. While non-normalized skin temperature alone could accurately estimate only about 65% of thermal states, the PTS model based on normalized skin features accurately predicted 87% of thermal states.",

In particular, the spread of social network services is allowing researchers in science and technology to share and develop their latest technologies at a fast rate. In the era of Big Data, there are increasing needs for a system that can infer analytical information about the research activities of such researchers, but no system that satisfies the requirements exists at the moment. Therefore, this study proposes a sematic complex event processing model for reasoning. The study then details an architecture in which such analytics is processed on a real-time basis in a distributed environment. With this architecture, researchers can easily monitor their individual research activities in an up to date manner and use such analytical data as a basis to set their future research directions.",

We have adapted the data flow in CBM classical architecture in order to consider the resultant information from maintenance operations associated with the technical teams and their contexts. For this purpose was used a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) approach to consider human and context factors. Considering the CPS as system that combines and coordinates physical and computational elements, the CPS incorporates the ability to act in the physical world with the intelligence from cyber or virtual world. In this paper, we propose to use a CPS for taking account human/context factors applied maintenance strategies. The proposed tool, called Toogle-IMS, aims at developing an advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applied to Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS). We have applied the Toogle-IMS in two case studies associated with: i. mobile robots in maintenance and ii. mobile trucks in shipyards.",

abstract = "As a new form of sustainable development, the concept “Smart Cities” knows a large expansion during the recent years. It represents an urban model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will present in this paper.",

We reflect on challenges and opportunities faced by a ‘boundary organisation’ that interfaces between science and policy, taking as example the European Commission’s Directorate General Joint Research Centre, whose mission is stated as that to be the “in-house science service”. We suggest that such an institution can be exemplary as to what could be changed to improve the quality of evidence feeding into the policy processes in the European Union. This paper suggests how an in-house culture of reflexivity and humility could trigger changes in the existing styles and methods of scientific governance; at the JRC, taken as example, this would mean opening up to the existing plurality of norms and styles of scientific inquiry, and adopting more participatory approaches of knowledge production, assessment and governance. We submit that the institutional changes advocated here are desirable and urgent in order to confront the ongoing erosion of trust in ‘evidence based policy’, anticipating controversies before they become evident in the institutional setting in which institutions operate.",

To this aim, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and wireless communication technologies in particular may represent very valuable tools to implement distributed and mobile sensing applications capable to continuously sense the working environment and the workers' health and safety conditions. The effective deployment of such applications in critical environments, like the industrial one, require the availability of a platform capable to monitor the operation and performance of the heterogeneous wireless networks that will connect the mobile sensors to remote control centers. This paper presents the platform implemented for this purpose in the context of the FASyS project. In addition to monitoring the status of heterogeneous wireless networks, the implemented platform provides the capability to reconfigure remotely the communication settings of wireless nodes based on possible malfunctioning or QoS degradation notifications. These functionalities will help guaranteeing the reliable and robust wireless communications required in industrial environments to implement innovative labor risk prevention applications exploiting ICT technologies.",

Joining volume, variety and velocity of data, with Industry 4.0, makes the opportunity to enhance sustainable innovation in the Factories of the Future. In this, the collection, integration, storage, processing and analysis of data is a key challenge, being Big Data systems needed to link all the entities and data needs of the factory. Thereby, this paper addresses this key challenge, proposing and implementing a Big Data Analytics architecture, using a multinational organisation (Bosch Car Multimedia – Braga) as a case study.

With respect to the environment, a critical concern is the lack of control and the inadequate management of the solid waste generated in urban centers. Among the challenges are proper waste-collection management, treatment, and disposal, with an emphasis on sustainable management. This paper presents a systematic review on scientific publications concerning decision support systems applied to Solid Waste Management (SWM) using ICTs and OR in the period of 2010–2013. A statistical analysis of the eighty-seven most relevant publications is presented, encompassing the ICTs and OR methods adopted in SWM, the processes of solid-waste management where they were adopted, and which countries are investigating solutions for the management of solid waste. A detailed discussion on how the ICTs and OR methods have been combined in the solutions was also presented. The analysis and discussion provided aims to help researchers and managers to gather insights on technologies/methods suitable the SWM challenges they have at hand, and on gaps that can be explored regarding technologies/methods that could be useful as well as the processes in SWM that currently do not benefit from using ICTs and OR methods.",

abstract = "Integration of heterogeneous sensing materials in microelectronic devices is essential to accomplish compact and highly integrated environmental sensors. For this purpose, a micro-patterning method of electrospun metal oxide nanofibers based on electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing process was developed in this work. Several types of metal oxide (SnO2, In2O3, WO3 and NiO) nanofibers that were produced by electrospinning, fragmented into smaller pieces by ultrasonication, and dissolved in organic solvents were utilized as inks for the printing. Constant or pulsed wave bias consisting of base and jetting voltages were applied between a nozzle and a substrate to generate a jetting of nanofiber solutions. Several parameters for EHD printing such as pulse width, inner diameter of the nozzle, distance from the nozzle to the substrate, and stage speed, were optimized for accurate micro-patterning of electrospun nanofibers. By using optimized printing parameters, microscale patterns of electrospun nanofibers with a minimum diameter less than 50μm could be realized. Gas sensors were fabricated by EHD printing on the microelectrodes and then used for the detection of toxic gases such as NO2, CO and H2S. Four kinds of metal oxides could detect down to 0.1ppm of NO2, 1ppm of H2S and 20ppm of CO gases. Also, heterogeneous nanofiber gas sensor array was fabricated by the same printing method and could detect NO2 using the sensor array platform with microheaters. Furthermore, microscale patterns of nanofibers by EHD printing could be applied to the suspended MEMS platform without any structural damage and this sensor array could detect NO2 and H2S gases with 20mW power consumption.",

However, it is still unclear if MC goods have a positive impact on the environment due to the many influencing factors in comparison to mass produced goods. With Google's “Project Ara”, a modular and customizable smartphone approach is very likely to reach market maturity and its economic, social and ecologic impacts are still unclear. Using a qualitative case study approach, we shed light on its potential economic success. Furthermore, we use the two theoretical concepts of Eco Innovation (EI) and Systemic Innovation (SI) to assess Google Ara's potential to lead to changes in terms of ecologic and social concerns. In our analysis, we show that Project Ara has the potential to outperform its competitors of modular smartphones. We work out that Google's modular approach could lead to a longer useful life of smartphones – or at least for some components. Finally, we affirm Project Ara's general potential for being an SI.

abstract = "Hand deformities often become a major obstacle in conducting everyday tasks for many people around the globe. Rehabilitation procedures are widely used for strengthening the hand muscles, which in turn leads to the restoration of functionality of the affected hand. This paper conducts a survey of various wearable technologies that can be used to accurately quantify the rehabilitation progress in terms of fingers' hand joint angles. Based on the data acquisition methods, these technologies can be mainly divided into six categories: 1) Flex sensor based; 2) Accelerometer based; 3) Vision based; 4) Hall-effect based; 5) Stretch sensor based; and 6) Magnetic sensor based. The main focus of some of the discussed technologies has been on various other domains, like gaming gloves, tele-manipulation etc., and thus their usage for rehabilitation of hand joints could be quite interesting. This paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of these wearable technologies along with some examples of their implementations. Based on our survey results, we propose a wearable glove for accurately measuring hand joint angles with enhanced features for better diagnosis and rehabilitation.",

abstract = "Nowadays, mashups applications are growing in popularity. They are accessible by cross-device applications, supporting multiple forms of interaction in cloud environments. In general, mashups manage a huge amount of heterogeneous data from different sources and handle different kinds of users. In this respect, mashup User Interfaces are becoming one of the most important pieces in many kinds of current management systems, such as for certain geographic or environmental information systems working on the Internet. In this type of systems, the user interface plays a particular role due to the huge variety of components or apps that the users need to manage at the same time. However, currently, there has been scant attention paid to the management of the user’s interaction with mashups interfaces. This goal involves the need of having important, well-constructed tools and methods conducting the data acquisition process for managing properly: (a) the interaction over the mashup user interfaces, at the front-end side; (b) the storage of the interaction in relational databases; and (c) well-supported microservices structures handled in the cloud. The fact of having valuable and flexible data acquisition processes encourages the deployment of others important issues of the interaction management, i.e., data searching, data mining, marketing, security, accessibility, usability or traceability of interaction data, among others. In this article, we present a flexible Data Acquisition System capable of capturing the human-computer interactions performed by users over mashup (User) Interfaces with the aim of storing them in a relational database. Firstly, the morphology of traditional mashup applications, their specifications and the relevant information that surrounds an interaction have been studied. Thereupon, a data acquisition system that stores user interaction on mashup based on such specifications was constructed. To achieve that purpose, an architecture of microservices was also designed in the cloud to detect, acquire, and collect the interactions performed over this kind of interfaces. The whole process is ready for acquiring internal data of the information system as well as context information and location awareness. To validate the data acquisition system, some tests on empirical case studies have been developed. Efficiency and effectiveness have also been determined by evaluating the performance of the acquisition system during different load tests. Finally, in order to ensure the software quality, a continuous integration strategy for software development and an easy management of the code have been used, facilitating the software maintenance alongside the microservice architecture, where functionalities are well encapsulated.",

However, one of the main issues of the existing HAR schemes is that the classification accuracy is relatively low, and in order to improve the accuracy, high computation overhead is needed. In this paper, an efficient Group-based Context-aware classification method for human activity recognition on smartphones, GCHAR is proposed, which exploits hierarchical group-based scheme to improve the classification efficiency, and reduces the classification error through context awareness rather than the intensive computation. Specifically, GCHAR designs the two-level hierarchical classification structure, i.e., inter-group and inner-group, and utilizes the previous state and transition logic (so-called context awareness) to detect the transitions among activity groups. In comparison with other popular classifiers such as RandomTree, Bagging, J48, BayesNet, KNN and Decision Table, thorough experiments on the realistic dataset (UCI HAR repository) demonstrate that GCHAR achieves the best classification accuracy, reaching 94.1636%, and time consumption in training stage of GCHAR is four times shorter than the simple Decision Table and is decreased by 72.21% in classification stage in comparison with BayesNet.",

One of the novel aspects of the developed system is the testability of all the important modules of the ASIC (both analog and digital) using auxiliary circuits implemented in the ASIC. Another novel aspect is a new embedded and efficient signal processing algorithm which is robust to small motion artifacts. This new algorithm has been implemented on a low-power micro-controller (embedded processing mode) as well as on PC using Python (remote processing mode). The PO ASIC is fabricated in 180 nm mixed-mode CMOS technology and it works at 1.8 V supply voltage. The average power consumption of the analog front-end is 176 µW and that of the digital module controlling the analog front-end is 23 µW. The prototype PO system made using the custom ASIC operates from a 3.7 V lithium ion battery and consumes about 8 mW power. The prototype is housed in a 3D printed casing and it connects with a display device via USB or wirelessly to laptop/smartphone/tablet. Readings on 20 subjects, both in the lab and in hospital, show less than 2% deviation in the measured SpO2 level and worst case deviation of 2.7 beats per minute for the measured heart rate, when compared with the commercial POs.",

abstract = "The consent model of privacy protection assumes that individuals control their personal information and are able to assess the risks associated with data sharing. The model is attractive for policy-makers and automakers because it has the effect of glossing over the conceptual ambiguities that are latent in definitions of privacy. Instead of formulating a substantive and normative position on what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstance, individuals are said to have control over their data. Organizations have obligations to respect rights to notice, access and consent regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data once that data has been shared. The policy goal becomes how to provide individuals with control over their personal data in the consent model of privacy protection. This paper argues that the privacy issues raised by vehicular ad hoc networks make this approach increasingly untenable. It is argued that substantive rules that establish a basic set of privacy norms regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data are necessary. This can be realized in part via a privacy code of practice for the connected vehicle. This paper first explores the relationship between privacy, consent and personal information in relation to the connected car. This is followed by a description of vehicular ad hoc networks and a survey of the technical proposals aimed at securing data. The privacy issues that will likely remain unsolved by enhancing individual consent are then discussed. The last section provides some direction on how a code of practice can assist in determining when individual consent will need to be enhanced and when alternatives to consent will need to be implemented.",

Yet, more work is needed to evaluate how financial verses social market norms influence economic decisions with regard to transportation. For this study, roughly 500 participants were offered differing incentives in four identical trials. These randomly assigned incentives included various monetary amounts, a free gift, or a social nudge tapping into altruistic values (in this case, benefits to the environment). After tests for homogeneity, the results showed the social nudge had a high degree of effectiveness, when compared to both the financial incentives and gifts. Furthermore, the results indicated that mixing financial and social norms caused both to be less effective. These findings suggest that fiscal incentive programs used to influence travel decisions may be lacking. In fact, this research suggests a new focus on behavioral economics in travel programs, and more emphasis on social norms and values as tools to facilitate changes in travel behaviors and nudge individuals to more healthy and climate-sensitive forms of travel.",

This paper presents results from a simulation-based study which aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using agent-based simulation tools to model the impacts of shared autonomous vehicles. First, the paper outlines a research framework for the development and evaluation of low carbon mobility solutions driven by two disruptive forces which are changing the mobility landscape and providing consumers with more choices to meet their transport needs: automated self-driving and on-demand shared mobility services. The focus of this paper is on development of rigorous models for understanding the demand for travel in the age of connected mobility, and assessing their impacts particularly under scenarios of autonomous or self-driving on-demand shared mobility. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the paper provides initial results from a pilot study on a small road network in Melbourne, Australia. A base case scenario representing the current situation of using traditional privately owned vehicles, and two autonomous mobility on-demand (AMoD) scenarios were simulated on a real transport network. In the first scenario (AMoD1), it was assumed that the on-demand vehicles were immediately available to passengers (maximum waiting times is zero). This constraint was relaxed in the second scenario (AMoD2) by increasing the allowable passenger waiting times up to a maximum of 5 minutes. The results showed that using the AMoD system resulted in a significant reduction in both the number of vehicles required to meet the transport needs of the community (reduction of 43% in AMoD1, and 88% in AMoD2), and the required on-street parking space (reduction of 58% in AMoD1 and 83% in AMoD2). However, the simulation also showed that this was achieved at the expense of a less significant increase in the total VKT (increase of 29% in AMoD1 and 10% in AMoD2). The paper concludes by describing how the model is being extended, the remaining challenges that need to be overcome in this research, and outlines the next steps to achieve the desired outcomes.",

Increased temperatures have a tremendous effect on the energy demand for cooling, with a great impact on peak and total electricity demand.

Significant effort is performed in the integration of photovoltaic panels (PV) and micro turbines in the urban context showing a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions. At the same time attention is drawn to an often-overlooked aspect regarding renewable energy technologies, in that despite having low operating costs their overall benefits are often not well understood and consequently are often evaluated as being less profitable than fossil fuel alternatives, even though they are future proof about energy cost. The aim of the present paper is to describe the role of renewable energy technologies and zero carbon technologies in covering the future increased energy demand for cooling. The integration of photovoltaics in the urban environment through PV facades, pavements, and shading devices are discussed. The role of Information and Computer Technology and smart grids in the efficient management of renewables in urban scale is discussed. The role of smart metering, users ‘integration and demand response capabilities for future zero energy urban neighborhoods is revealed.",

The structure, morphology and surface characteristics of the MoS2-TiO2 composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). The results showed that TiO2 nanotubes can be filled and covered by flake-like MoS2 nanostructure. The numbers of the MoS2 layers ranged from 1 to 3. The TiO2 nanotube sensor shows a normal n-type response to reducing ethanol gas, whereas MoS2-TiO2 exhibits p-type response with excellent sensing performances. Specially, the sensitivity for the MoS2-TiO2 heterojunction increased almost 11 times than TiO2 nanotubes. This conversion of sensing behavior can be explained by the formation of p-n heterojunction structures.",

The increasing complex interrelation among such critical systems creates new security vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise sensible data and other systems also very far from the impact zone. Identifying and analyzing these complex interactions represent a challenge to the evaluation of the real vulnerability of each critical system. On the other hand, the evaluation of this complex and large-scale systems requires expensive and sophisticated modeling practices, simulation tools, and experimentation infrastructure. Therefore, we present a hybrid and distributed simulation platform for cyber-security analysis of large-scale critical infrastructure systems. It enables testers to assemble complex and distributed experimental scenarios in the cloud, by integrating different simulated environments, on which perform sophisticated vulnerability analysis, by exploiting penetration testing and monitoring facilities.",

The nanowires mesh is successfully made through the consecutive immobilization of ultrasmall Pd and Mg nanoparticles on a commercial filtration membrane. Specifically, a simple magnetron sputtering process enabled the mesh-type Pd/Mg nanowires with outstanding H2 gas sensing property at room temperature. The as-fabricated sensor can sufficiently detect H2 concentration from 10 to 40,000ppm, showing remarkable device stability, high response magnitude, and fast response time. Such high sensing performance of the Pd/Mg nanowire mesh is due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio and the confinement-induced suppression of the phase transition from Pd/H solid solution (α-phase) to Pd hydride (β-phase) of the sensing surface. Moreover, good selectivity, negligible humidity effect, and decreased response time at extremely bending state provide the possibility of wearable electronic applications. It will open up a new paradigm to manufacture bimetallic nanowire mesh simply and enable wearable H2 sensor for futuristic applications.",

Currently, most of TENG devices are constructed with micro-structured surfaces using complicated manufacturing processes. Owing to the lack of high-volume manufacturing scalability, it still remains a bottleneck to apply TENG into the commercial products. In this work, we report the development of a novel TENG, which leverages on the regenerated, flexible, biocompatible, and highly transparent silk-fibroin as a triboelectric layer and can be deposited on a PET/ITO substrate (SF/PET/ITO) using a simple spray-coating process. The as-fabricated TENG exhibits a maximum voltage of 213.9V and a high power density of 68.0mW/m2 as a result of the ability of losing electrons and rough surface rendered by the silk-fibroin. We further demonstrate that this generator can charge a capacitor (10μF) to 4.5V in 6mins, and instantaneously light up as many as 100 commercial LED bulbs. We anticipate that the large-scale fabrication of silk-fibroin-based TENGs will serve as a promising system for electricity generation with an extremely low cost to commercial applications.",

In this algorithm, the virtual clustering technique is performed during routing process which makes use of the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The residual energy and position of the nodes are the primary parameters to select cluster head. The control strategy for mobile sink to collect data from cluster head is well designed. Extensive simulation results show that the energy consumption is much reduced, the network lifetime is prolonged, and the transmission delay is reduced in our proposed routing algorithm than some other popular routing algorithms.",

Standard printed circuit board (PCB)-based devices are obtrusive and rigid and hence not suitable for textile based implementations.

However, high surface roughness and porosity of textiles prevents efficient and reliable printing of electronics on textile.

Printed conductive traces were optimized in terms of conductivity and resolution by controlling the number of over-printed layers. The tracking device determines the wearer's position using WiFi and this information can be displayed on any internet-enabled device, such as smart phone.

SOA uses loosely coupled services that can be reused flexibly to develop different applications. MidSHM is a three-layered middleware with each of the layers containing various services that address issues such as in-network processing, fault tolerance, dynamicity, quality of service etc. We describe operations of various services and use two application examples to illustrate the usability and flexibility of MidSHM.

Ethical debates are typically articulated within the context of ethical theories. These theories help to frame our understanding of moral issues. Their use affords insight into the context and the logic of the moral arguments being presented, thereby providing us with a rational mechanism by which to better evaluate whether an intended action or actual outcome is morally right or wrong.

Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators, exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs. Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a more sustainable mobility and transport systems. Sii-Mobility is grounded on Km4City ontology and tools for smart city data aggregation, analytics support and service production exploiting smart city API. To this end, Sii-Mobility/Km4City APIs have been compared to the state of the art solutions. Moreover, the proposed architecture has been assessed in terms of performance, computational and network costs in terms of measures that can be easily performed on private cloud on premise. The computational costs and workloads of the data ingestion and data analytics processes have been assessed to identify suitable measures to estimate needed resources.

abstract = "An enormous effort has been made during the recent years towards the recognition of human activity based on wearable sensors. Despite the wide variety of proposed systems, most existing solutions have in common to solely operate on predefined settings and constrained sensor setups. Real-world activity recognition applications and users rather demand more flexible sensor configurations dealing with potential adverse situations such as defective or missing sensors. In order to provide interoperability and reconfigurability, heterogeneous sensors used in wearable activity recognition systems must be fairly abstracted from the actual underlying network infrastructure. This work presents MIMU-Wear, an extensible ontology that comprehensively describes wearable sensor platforms consisting of mainstream magnetic and inertial measurement units (MIMUs). MIMU-Wear describes the capabilities of MIMUs such as their measurement properties and the characteristics of wearable sensor platforms including their on-body location. A novel method to select an adequate replacement for a given anomalous or nonrecoverable sensor is also presented in this work. The proposed sensor selection method is based on the MIMU-Wear Ontology and builds on a set of heuristic rules to infer the candidate replacement sensors under different conditions. Then, queries are iteratively posed to select the most appropriate MIMU sensor for the replacement of the defective one. An exemplary application scenario is used to illustrate some of the potential of MIMU-Wear for supporting seamless operation of wearable activity recognition systems.",

This involves a crucial shift in emphasis from regulating Big Data collection to regulating the phases of analysis and use. In order to benefit from the use of Big Data analytics in the field of security, a framework has to be developed that adds new layers of protection for fundamental rights and safeguards against erroneous and malicious use. Additional regulation is needed at the levels of analysis and use, and the oversight regime is in need of strengthening. At the level of analysis – the algorithmic heart of Big Data processes – a duty of care should be introduced that is part of an internal audit and external review procedure. Big Data projects should also be subject to a sunset clause. At the level of use, profiles and (semi-) automated decision-making should be regulated more tightly. Moreover, the responsibility of the data processing party for accuracy of analysis – and decisions taken on its basis – should be anchored in legislation. The general and security-specific oversight functions should be strengthened in terms of technological expertise, access and resources. The possibilities for judicial review should be expanded to stimulate the development of case law.",

As a proof of concept, a platform containing a matrix of magnetic energy transmitters has been developed and integrated into a mattress. This system is able to feed one or more wearable sensor nodes, attached to the patient, with the purpose of wirelessly recording vital signals over an extended period of time. Each of these power transmitters is designed to transfer up to 10mW of power over a maximal distance of 300mm. Moreover, the platform embeds online optimization software to deal with vertical as well as horizontal sensor node movements. The position and orientation of each freely moving sensor node can be dynamically determined and a local magnetic field, with a matching radiated power level, can be selectively induced in the area where the sensor nodes are positioned. This approach therefore limits the radiation exposure to the patient to the minimum viable level. The prototype is successfully tested in a laboratory set-up.",

However, powering them in a stable and sustainable manner remains a challenge and highly desired. In this work, we proposed a humidity-resisting triboelectric nanogenerator (HR-TENG) to harvest energy from human biomechanical movements for wearable electronics. The electrospun nanofibrous membranes were rationally tailored to eliminate the adverse effects of water vapor on the electrical output and construct a high-performance humidity-resisting triboelectric nanogenerator. It could work with improved adaptability to the environmental humidity caused by human perspiration during sport. With human biomechanical motions, such as hand tapping, the wearable HR-TENG can respectively deliver a current and voltage output up to 28µA and 345V, corresponding to a power density of 1.3W/m2 under a relative humidity 55%. It was also demonstrated to sustainably power an electronic watch, a commercial calculator, a thermal meter and light up about 400 LEDs by harvesting the biomechanical energy from human movements under different ambient humidity. And its electrical output was still at a relatively high level when the relative humidity was increased from 30% to 90%. Given a collection of compelling features of being wearable, flexible and cost-effective, the HR-TENG could be utilized as a sustainable power source to drive wearable electronics during human sport even with heavy perspiration.",

The smart in-car camera can detect objects in recorded videos during driving, and can decide which part of videos needs to be stored in cloud platforms to save local storage space. The system puts the training process and model repository in cloud platforms, and the recognition process and data gathering in mobile devices. The mobile side is implemented in NVIDIA Jetson TK1, and the communication is carried out via Git protocol to ensure the success of data transmission in unstable network environments. Experimental results show that detection rate can achieve up to four frame-per-second with Faster R-CNN, and the system can work well even when the network connection is unstable. We also compared the performance of system with and without GPU, and found that GPU still plays a critical role in the recognition side for deep learning.",

abstract = "The number of people with a chronic disease is rapidly increasing, giving the healthcare industry more challenging problems. To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology–aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-making knowledge using Protégé Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient for patient risk factors extraction and diabetes prescriptions.",

abstract = "Energy Harvesting is the main solution to ensure the powering of sensors and micro-processors, especially in extreme environmental conditions where the use of batteries can be expensive or even impractical. In this work, a coupled-mode aero elastic fluttering system, exploiting self-sustained oscillations to harvest electrical energy from the mechanical one, is proposed. An airfoil can freely turn around its rotational axis, bounded to two elastomers parallel to the flow: in the presence of a fluid in motion, under particular mechanical conditions, the system exhibits limit cycle oscillations characterized by noteworthy amplitude and frequency. Moving in the space of parameters every flow speed range is theoretically achievable for the purposes of electrical extraction; this work will focus on low wind speed conditions. By positioning a pair of coils at the ends of the rotational axis of the wing and fixing magnets in an alternated polarity in front of their quasi-vertical harmonic motion, an electro-magnetic coupling (EMc) is obtained: during the oscillations an alternated voltage at the ends of the coils is measured. Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs), composite material formed by coupling two stretchable electrodes to a high permittivity rubber, forming a capacitor in which the capacitance changes with the stretching, replace traditional elastomers: this permits, by charging the DEGs in the maximal stretched status and discharging it in the pre-stretch status, to amplify the input voltage. DEGs cannot be an autonomous powering, because they need an external electrical energy source. Synergistically, the use of an integrated circuit designed for storing efficiently the charges from the EMc in a supercapacitor (SC), and electronics able to manage the DEGs by a ‘charge pumping’ process supplying a second SC, allows to ensure an excellent and adaptable autonomous powering. A further synergy is introduced exploiting intrinsic effects of the two electrical extraction strategies adopted in the system: EM damping due to the resistance load, and the change in stiffness of DEGs when a voltage is applied, can extend the operating speed range, increasing its global efficiency. Centimeter-sized devices exploiting EMc and DEGs, and an overview about DEGs materials are presented in this work.",

After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating.",

Thus, the question arises what mechanisms contribute to raise productivity in the current revolution “Industrie 4.0”. Whereas the initial point of all past industrial revolutions can be located in the industry, they resulted in a tremendous change in society. In the present industrial revolution it is the other way around: Reviewing the beginning of the current transformation process, it is not driven by the production industry itself. Instead one of its main drivers is the invention of social networks and smart devices in combination with the employees’ appealing to it. This development of interconnectivity pushes into the industrial sector today. For instance, there exists a desire of employees to bring their own device to work. According to a survey by Accenture 82 percent of the Chinese respondents would be “more resourceful” if they chose their own hardware and software for work. The first three revolutions had a strong focus on the shop floor. This is also true for the present industrial revolution: The public view is merely on its impact on production processes. Therefore, this paper expands this view and additionally analyses the effects of the relating transformation processes to the indirect departments. The paper first analyses the enablers which mainly contribute to Industrie 4.0. Subsequently a reference systems is deduced which consists of basic collaboration mechanisms to increase productivity in the direct and indirect departments. A wide transparency and understanding of those collaboration mechanisms empower producing companies to profit from Industrie 4.0 by deriving individual activities which lead to a growth in productivity and therefore competitiveness. The specified approaches were conducted within the framework of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology in High-Wage countries” of the RWTH Aachen University.",

However, smart energy city development requires a well-defined and consistent conceptual core in order to ensure its accurate interpretation and successful implementation. This research aims to define smart energy city development not only in a theoretical context, but also in terms of practical solutions. We adopt the 5W+1H (why, what, who, where, when, how) model integrated with literature review and expert knowledge elicitation, i.e., focus groups and interviews. This results in: (i) clarification of general interrelationship between smart energy city, smart city, and sustainable city; (ii) a holistic, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive conceptual framework of smart energy city, revealing its principles, objectives, domains of intervention, stakeholders, and time and spatial scales; and (iii) a set of smart energy practical solutions and technologies categorized in the eight domains of intervention: buildings and districts, transportation and mobility, energy and ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructures, collaborative planning, consumer behavior management, energy and data management, as well as two cross-cutting domains. We suggest that sustainable, rational, and integrated application of new technologies, collaboration of multiple stakeholders, and integration of multiple urban energy domains, mainstreamed in energy specific targets, enable distinguishing real from labeled smart energy city development. We suggest that smart energy solutions are mostly effective when combined with other sustainable solutions.

abstract = "The complexity of collection systems for Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in the EU is increasing, due to the latest directive that sets new collection targets and modes. The high variability and the uncertainty of reverse flows require innovative logistic approaches. One recent option for increasing efficiency and responsiveness in waste collection services, boosted by new technological solutions for waste level monitoring, is to adopt a dynamic collection scheme, where the collection frequency is not established a priori (based on a fixed plan), but it is based on the actual filling levels of waste bins. This option can allow the service provider to plan the collection service following the actual demand, resulting in a more responsive service, while improving the logistic efficiency. This paper evaluates the implementation of dynamic scheduling schemes for the collection of WEEE. A hybrid simulation model has been developed in order to support researchers and practitioners in assessing quantitative impacts of adopting dynamic scheduling in WEEE collection. Three logistic alternatives (a fixed collection schedule scheme, a pure dynamic scheme and a mixed one) have been compared in a test case based on data of an Italian municipality; collection services for different types of WEEE (i.e. large appliances and small items) have been analyzed. Results show a promising performance of dynamic schedules compared to the fixed one, revealing, for the specific test case, how a mixed solution can combine the advantages of dynamic and fixed scheduling, gaining flexibility towards customer demand while improving truck resource utilization.",

However, when shoppers have to deal with technologically sophisticated retail services, concerns arise regarding the customers' adoption and their psychological reactions towards smart retail technologies. This study explores the factors which constitute customers' experience with the smart retail technologies and examines an innovative construct (i.e. smart customer experience) in retailing. The development of a conceptual model explores smart customer experiences and their consequences on smart technology, customer, and retailer-level outcomes. Guided by technology adoption research, this research examines the relationships between smart customer experience, customer satisfaction, perceived risk, behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, stickiness to retail store, shopping effectiveness, and consumer well-being. This study uses a multi-phased research approach. Findings indicate that smart customer experience directly enhances satisfaction and reduces perceived risk towards smart retail technologies. Customer satisfaction increases behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, stickiness to retailer, shopping effectiveness, and customer well-being. Perceived risk reduces behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, shopping effectiveness, and stickiness to retailer. Finally, customer satisfaction and perceived risk both mediate the relationships between smart customer experience and outcome variables.",

The subscribers demand improved data rates, with reduced latency and increased system capacity. To endure the rising demands, cellular networks need to undergo suitable changes. For fulfillment of the rising needs of users and efficient utilization of the available scarce resources, device-to-device (D2D) communication is being looked upon as an important emerging technology for present and future cellular networks. It allows peer-to-peer communication between users, with improved spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and system throughput. In this paper, a detailed survey on device-to-device (D2D) communications has been offered, along with the challenges which exist for D2D (like resource allocation, security, interference management etc.) to become a successful paradigm of wireless networks. In order to fulfill the subscriber needs, architecture has been proposed which assures overcoming the various implementation challenges of D2D communication. The paper largely focuses on security in D2D communication and the possible attacks to which the direct links are susceptible to. For ensuring a secure D2D communication, solution has been proposed, based upon Internet Protocol Security (IP Sec).",

Reliable and on-time delivery of safety messages is critical in VANETs that requires extremely efficient broadcast models. In this paper, we model the reliability of flooding used as the underlying data dissemination protocol for time-critical safety messages. We consider a multi-hop VANET and model end-to-end reliability provided by the network layer. The analytical results unleash important insights about the flooding mechanism. For instance, the reliability drops exponentially beyond a certain threshold value of packet loss probability. Secondly, the impact of hop length on reliability can be catastrophic if not handled appropriately. Keeping in view of the fact that energy-efficient protocols is a key requirement in the upcoming Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we also show that restrictive flooding is more energy-efficient than plain flooding under the same reliability constraint. We validate our theoretical findings through simulations and propose modifications to plain flooding to make it more reliable.",

Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between the implementation of the smart city concept and the idea of sustainable transport, particularly with regard to the reduction of transport generated CO2 emissions. The study estimates CO2 emissions for different potential scenarios of development for the Warsaw transport system until 2050 using the United Nations' ForFITS (For Future Inland Transport Systems) model. The study also analyses the additional impact on CO2 emissions of smart city elements as determinants of mobility. The results show that meeting the reduction targets set by the European Union 2011 White Paper on Transport will be challenging, requiring an in-depth transformation of the transport and energy sectors. This study also confirms that smart city solutions can play a crucial role in mitigating transport emissions and meeting reduction goals.

abstract = "Integration of all smart systems (such as smart home, smart parking, etc.) and the IoT devices (such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones) in the city can play a vital role to develop the urban services by building their city digital and smarter. However, interconnection of lots of IoT objects to collect urban data over the Internet to launch a smart digital city, effects vast volume of data generation, termed as Big Data. Thus, it is a challenging task to integrate IoT devices and smart systems in order to harvest and process such big amount of real-time city data in an effective manner aimed at creating a Smart Digital City. Therefore, in this paper, we have established an IoT-based Smart City by using Big Data analytics while harvesting real-time data from the city. We used sensors’ deployment including sensors at smart home, smart parking, vehicular networking, surveillance, weather and water monitoring system, etc., for real time data collection. The complete system is described by its proposed architecture and implementation prototype using Hadoop ecosystem in a real environment. In addition, the Smart Digital City services are extended by developing the intelligent Smart Transportation System by means of big graph processing to facilitate citizens while providing real-time traffic information and alerts. The proposed system consists of number of stages including data generation and collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing, and decision making. The efficiency of the system is extended by applying Big Data processing using Apache Spark over Hadoop. Whereas, the big city graph processing is achieved by using Giraph over Hadoop. The system is practically implemented by taken existing smart systems and IoT devices as city data sources to develop the Smart Digital City. The proposed system is evaluated with respect to efficiency in terms of scalability and real-time data processing.",

This paper provides insights from semi-structured interviews with 31 UK experts from government, industry, academia, and civil society. Participants were asked for their views on the major uncertainties surrounding the ability of the UK to meet its 2050 climate targets. The research reveals a range of views on the most critical uncertainties, how they can be mitigated, and how the research community can develop approaches to better support strategic decision-making. The study finds that the socio-political dimensions of uncertainty are discussed by experts almost as frequently as technological ones, but that there exist divergent perspectives on the role of government in the transition and whether or not there is a requirement for increased societal engagement. Finally, the study finds that decision-makers require a new approach to uncertainty assessment that overcomes analytical limits to existing practice, is more flexible and adaptable, and which better integrates qualitative narratives with quantitative analysis. Policy design must escape from ‘caged’ thinking concerning what can or cannot be included in models, and therefore what types of uncertainties can or cannot be explored.",

A single anomaly can affect the network performance so it is crucial to detect its origin. However, when different kinds of anomalies are present at the same time, it becomes more complicated to detect their root causes. In addition, the network administrator has to deal with questions related to network health, such as bandwidth bottlenecks, and network misuse. Detecting these problems quickly is essential to take appropriate countermeasures. Although many solutions have been proposed to detect anomalies, they do not address other important questions related to network health. In this paper, a system capable of detecting and classifying the anomalies, and extracting detailed information from the network usage, is presented. A graph representation is used, allowing a deep inspection of the IP flows exchanged between the active devices in the network. The Tsallis entropy is applied to detect anomalies. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the network administrator to create metrics to monitor and acquire detailed information about the network equipment, services, and users. Tests using real and artificial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system to detect simultaneous anomalies, and to provide useful information for network-management tasks.",

Thus, it is difficult to establish a streamlined flow in the entire process of the complex built environment system and to arrange and optimize the required resources in a timely manner. To address this challenge, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of the built environment system and to provide the decision-makers with timely and accurate information for making better decisions. For achieving this objective, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for an Intelligent Planning Unit (IPU) for the complex built environment system, which consists of three phases (i.e., IPU planning, IPU application, and IPU network). An IPU represents a well-defined planning unit that can be initiated to achieve a specific purpose (e.g., cost, schedule, materials, and process). An IPU can be defined by breaking down the physical entities and processes in the complex built environment system into carefully planned units (even nano-scale units). A well-defined IPU can be replicated and implemented at the different levels of complexity; and then, it can be improved through a refinement process using the intelligent feature of communication. This paper illustrated the IPU concept through several examples and also highlighted possible challenges and opportunities in implementing the IPU concept in the complex built environment system. This paper is designed to ensure that a project meets the client expectations on various aspects in the complex built environment system.",

abstract = "This paper discusses how local governments can team up for joint service provision, be more adaptive towards new technological and organisational changes and introduce novel services following main industry trends (e.g. predictive analytics, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence). The conceptual approach is to use Public Value (PV) as the framework for the organisation and management of government performance, one of the most important successor ‘paradigmettes’ of the New Public Management (NPM). Based on the PV concept, the ‘adaptive model’ for local governments is introduced according to which each procured ICT solution is preceded by agile, open, bottom-up and experimental trial. This model is corroborated via recent empirical evidence from the case of Helsinki and Tallinn which was obtained by observing how city governments collaborate on joint innovation-lab-type structures and conduct agile trials in the field of smart mobility before traditional procurement.",

abstract = "Past research has found that frequent energy usage feedback is an important factor in reducing home energy consumption, and that the sensory appeal and cognitive relevance of the feedback are key components of user engagement with energy systems. The visual design of the information interface is important not just due to its role in communicating data of cognitive relevance, but also because the choice of information type and format is important towards achieving interactive Hebbian learning. The objective of the current research study was to investigate the possible effect of image format on the human emotional response to scenes of energy systems, and to evaluate whether any gender related differences in emotional response occurred. An automated PC-based test was developed which utilised five visual image formats (Optical Gray-Scale, Optical Coloured, Optical Augmented, Infrared Gray-Scale and Infrared Blue-Red) and nine home energy scenes (hot water boiler, radiator, water faucet, kitchen oven, tea kettle, toaster, electrical connector, laptop computer and tea mug). The emotional response of the participant was measured in the automated test by means of a Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) which provided symbolic graphical representations of the human body under various degrees of emotional response, and associated Likert format rating scales for the valence and activation level of the emotional response. Comparison of the results obtained for the different visual scenes suggests that the greatest level of human emotional activation was achieved by the Infrared Blue-Red (thermal image) format, and that, generally, coloured images provided higher levels of emotional activation than gray-scale images. The increased activation achieved by the infrared images suggests attention capturing potential due to novelty, or due to the direct link to heat and energy, or both. Significant differences in emotional response (both activation and valence) were found to occur as a function of gender. The current results provide first guidance which a designer can use when choosing image spectrum and colours to represent energy systems on the displays of thermostats, smart meters and the energy devices.
Relevance to industry
The current results provide first guidance which a designer can use when choosing image spectrum and colours to represent energy systems on the displays of thermostats, smart meters and the energy devices. Such design guidance is currently lacking internationally but is of increasing importance due to the expansion of digital devices, internet services and the upcoming internet-of-things.",

However, existing research into the indicator system and evaluation methods is not enough to support calculation and subsequent publishing of UCDI. Building off current research into CE, its index systems and its evaluation, this paper puts forward an evaluation index system for urban CE development (UCDI) that uses an improved entropy methodology combining expert and entropy weightings. The index was calculated for 40 cities that were part of China's pilot CE cities program for alternating years in the five year period between 2012 and 2016 (that is, the index was calculated for 2012, 2014 and 2016). The study found that the level of urban CE increased significantly over the five year period, with that in the CE pilot cities growing at a faster rate than the national average. Results show that a certain relationship exists between UCDI, urban types and economic development, but has little relationship with industrial structure. Finally, recommendations for the promotion of urban CE are proposed.",

abstract = "Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) are deadly infectious diseases those transmit quickly through infected mosquitoes to human or from one infected person to another, resulting in substantial increase in worldwide morbidity and mortality rate. The symptoms of MBDs are almost similar to each other which makes it quite difficult to diagnose the specific disease. However, it is required to diagnose the patient for proper treatment and continuous monitoring of infected patients to control the infection of MBDs. Healthcare services based on fog-cloud assisted cyber-physical system are emerging as a proactive and efficacious solution to provide remote monitoring and early detection of infected users suffering from MBDs. Fog-cloud based cyber-physical system facilitates the alliance of devices in the physical space i.e. smart wearables, IoT sensors and smart cameras with cyber space to generate the required information. Afterwards, it uses cyber space to assimilate, analyze and share medical information amongst users and healthcare service providers. A novel system based on IoT sensors, cloud computing and fog computing is proposed to distinguish, classify and monitor the users infected with MBDs. The objective of this system is to control the outbreak of MBDs at an early stage. In the proposed system, similarity factor is calculated to differentiate among MBDs and then J48 decision tree classifier is used to classify the category of infection for each user. The alerts are instantly generated and sent on user’s mobile from fog layer in case of any abnormality. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used to sense the close proximity between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to monitor and represent the current state of the MBDs outbreak using close proximity data. The experimental evaluations of the proposed system resulted in high accuracy and low error rate to distinguish the MBDs and also provided 94% classification accuracy. The results also reveal that the TNA is an efficient tool to evaluate the state of MBDs outbreak using various statistical parameters.",

In this paper, the effort was focused on demonstrating the sensing capability of the chemiluminescence-based device for detecting soil deformation or movement in the event of a landslide.

Building cyber-physical system (CPS) models of machine tools is a key technology for intelligent manufacturing. The massive electronic data from a computer numerical control (CNC) system during the work processes of a CNC machine tool is the main source of the big data on which a CPS model is established. In this work-process model, a method based on instruction domain is applied to analyze the electronic big data, and a quantitative description of the numerical control (NC) processes is built according to the G code of the processes. Utilizing the instruction domain, a work-process CPS model is established on the basis of the accurate, real-time mapping of the manufacturing tasks, resources, and status of the CNC machine tool. Using such models, case studies are conducted on intelligent-machining applications, such as the optimization of NC processing parameters and the health assurance of CNC machine tools.",

The current knowledge on success factors for service innovation, such as formalized new service development (NSD) processes, predominantly comes from studying large firms with a relatively stable resource base. However, this neglect situations in which organizations face severe resource constraints. This paper argues that under such constraints, a formalized new service development process could be counter-productive and a bricolage perspective might better explain service innovation in resource-constrained environments. In this conceptual paper, we propose that four critical bricolage capabilities (addressing resource scarcity actively, making do with what is available, improvising when recombining resources, and networking with external partners) influence service innovation outcomes. Empirical illustrations from five organizations substantiate our conceptual development. Our discussion leads to a framework and four testable propositions that can guide further service research.",

In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in IISs is essential for using IT to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new IISs and by analyzing data usage in 149 IIS cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs. The main contribution of this study is to provide a simple yet comprehensive and empirically tested basis for the use and management of data to facilitate service value creation.",

abstract = "At present, energy efficiency represents one of the foremost challenges to achieve the transition toward a low-carbon society. Reducing energy use spans a broad range of technical issues and spatial scales: from building to districts, from cities to rural areas, and from energy power plants to electricity grids. In this frame, the challenge of enhancing energy efficiency can be understood as an extremely relevant topic for planning at the municipal level. Nevertheless, recent studies provide evidence that significant gaps exist in the enhancement of energy efficiency within municipal boundaries. The present research recognises that a comprehensive assessment of municipal energy performances is an essential starting point to facilitate local planning in enhancing energy efficiency. However, how can this challenge be translated into practice and applied to the implementation of local planning? As new models result from the transformation of existing ones, the development of a methodology associated with a case study in Portugal was deemed the most appropriate approach to contribute to knowledge in these fields. The primary objective of this study is to move toward more integrated process of planning for energy efficiency, supporting the definition of priorities and strategies to address energy saving improvements at municipal level. The assessment process involves a statistical analysis that using Geographical Information System, is combined and translated into spatial models to determine needs and set priorities within a Municipal Master Plan review. Based on this top-down approach, it becomes clear that energy efficiency is a cross-cutting issue interrelated with a blend of various disciplines: geography, spatial planning, urbanism, architecture, and civil engineering. The results enable us to understand why municipalities should be called upon to enhance energy efficiency by first looking at a comprehensive energy performance assessment. Embracing the whole municipal territory rather than only urban areas, is key to articulate energy efficiency and geographical, social, environmental and economic factors that are at the core of local planning.",

abstract = "Non-dedicated sensing models in smart cities, such as social sensing, aim at recruiting smart users while mobile social platforms’ vulnerability to identity theft attacks introduces the risks of de-incentivizing mobile users against participating and spreading disinformation through social platforms in case of successful identity theft attempts. In this paper, we present a mobile edge-based collaborative solution against identity theft over social platforms by taking advantage of the convergence of social, wireless, and mobile networks in the 5G Era. The collaborative framework delegates detection of a potential identity theft to other smart users who are the connections of the potential victim over a social platform. The collaborating smart users are not involved in semantic analysis but are assigned a subset of the contextual features of the smart user under review. We present thorough performance evaluation by using real social platform data in simulations. The numerical results show that collaboration among smart users can reveal anomalous behavior on the social accounts of other participants with a success ratio at the order of >90%. Furthermore, we show that False Positive (FP) decisions can be mitigated while False Negatives, which are less severe than FPs, can be reduced down to the order of ≤3%.",

abstract = "The Paris agreement stresses on concerted efforts to limit global temperature increase to 2 °C and make efforts towards achieving 1.5 °C temperature stabilization. Countries announced actions under the Nationally Determined Contributions outlining domestic mitigation actions to achieve the global target. Understanding the impact of these actions on achieving these ambitions requires an assessment of long term national level scenarios. Limited studies currently exist that model long term scenarios at national level addressing the impacts of Nationally Determined Contributions and the additional actions required, especially at the sectoral level. The paper compares four alternate future scenarios for India spanning till 2050, with a specific focus on the passenger and freight transportation. The analysis is performed using the ANSWER MARKAL model and complemented with methodologies to estimate transportation demand under strong decarbonisation pathways. The results show that 1.5 °C scenario would need immediate actions and deep transformations. Demand side actions would, in addition to infrastructure investments require transforming human behaviour through use of information technology, internet and sharing economy. Clean vehicle technologies need to play a much bigger role and fossil fuel dependence would be moderated with the dominance of electricity, hydrogen and biofuels. The higher share of electricity in transport is complimented with accelerated decarbonisation of electricity. This transformation required for 1.5 °C scenario calls for innovations that would be driven through national and sectoral policies and explicit carbon prices.",

abstract = "Purpose: Ultrasound scanning has been widely used for preliminary diagnosis as it is non-invasive and has good scope for the doctors to analyze many diseases. Due to lack of trained radiologists in remote areas, tele-radiology is used to diagnose the scanned ultrasound data. Availability of online radiographers and having communication facility for the portable ultrasound are issues in tele-radiology for using ultrasound scanning in remote health-care. In these situations, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) will be beneficial in diagnosing the patients with minimal manual intervention. Methods: We proposed FPGA based CAD algorithm for abnormality detection of kidney in ultrasound images. The proposed algorithm works in the following way: as a pre-processing, an ultrasound image is denoised and region of interest of kidney in ultrasound image is segmented. Intensity histogram features and Haralick features are extracted from the segmented kidney region. Based on extracted features, the classification algorithm is implemented in two stages. In first stage, a Look Up Table (LUT) based approach is used to differentiate between normal and abnormal kidney images. In second stage, after confirming the abnormality, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with extracted features is used to further classify the presence of stone or cyst in kidney. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a FPGA based Xilinx Kintex-7 board. Results: The proposed algorithm gave an accuracy of 98.14%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.82% in detecting the exact abnormality present in kidney ultrasound images. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and its hardware implementation will be beneficial for diagnosing the kidney in absence of radiologists and internet connectivity.",

Therefore, performance evaluation of different service strategies in complicated environments is important. Due to the diversity of context events, and the economic, legal, and ethical limitations, however, it is rather difficult or even impossible for traditional methods to conduct comprehensive evaluation for various service strategies. In this paper, we propose a computational experiment-based evaluation method, which mainly consists of three parts: customization of context-aware services, construction of experiment system, and performance evaluation of service strategy. Furthermore, one application of this method in coal mine industry is investigated specially. Alarm and evacuation services are taken as evaluation objects, and their implementation strategies are compared by designing different ``disaster scenes'' on our experiment platform.

Drawn upon the concept of socio-technical imaginaries we explore the discourses of social actors regarding the implementation of SG in the European Union, from policy makers, industry and consumer perspectives. In order to do so, we use knowledge assessment, a qualitative approach that looks into the pedigree of the knowledge input in policy processes and its quality in terms of fitness for purpose and function. Through the analysis of EU policy documents related to SG and interviews conducted with relevant social actors, we looked at the official visions about SG coming from the policy sphere, the main supporters of the SG vision and proposal. We looked into discourses, factual or imaginary argumentation and justifications, promises, motivations, appeals to the public and other narrative elements that scaffold the SG vision in Europe. We conclude that the SG proposal is aligned with current innovation narratives in the EU but presents some disconnects with citizen debates.",

abstract = "Smart TV in Korea faces an asymmetric situation between the purchase of terminals and the usage of services. In spite of this low utilization, there are few prior studies on the causes of adoption barriers for smart TV services in Korea. This study focuses on the research problem of, “Why do people not use smart TV services even after purchasing smart TV terminal in Korea?” Using survey data collected from Korean buyers of smart TV terminals, this study empirically analyzes the factors influencing the low usage of smart TV services. The study’s results show that a lack of sub-services, low network quality, and low usability significantly affect the usefulness of smart TV services. Further, the low usefulness, low usability, and alternatives are the primary determinants of low intention of using smart TV services.",

abstract = "Electroless deposition (ELD) is a well-known method for preparing thin films of metals and their alloys. It is a highly selective method allowing additive patterning of isolated and embedded structures on insulating substrates, e.g. glass, plastic or ceramic. It is a relatively low temperature (less than the boiling point of the electrolyte) and low cost process compared to other physical and chemical vapor deposition methods. ELD features uniform and normally conformal deposition (additives may affect its conformality) with low defect density and some unique material properties. In the last 30years electroless plating of metals (e.g. copper, gold, nickel, cobalt, palladium, iron, silver, etc.) and their alloys, was demonstrated for micro system applications: microelectronics, micro electro mechanics, micro electro optics and microfluidics, micro fuel cells, micro batteries etc. Electroless plating was also demonstrated on nano structures, both artificial and natural. In this paper we present a short tribute to the recent advances in electroless plating in the last 30years. Those advances and innovations are due to the work of many scientists and engineers on a time span started in the 19th century. The progress in electroless plating followed the need and the trend for better metallization technologies for complex structures with critical dimensions that had been shrinking continuously in the last few decades.",

On the basis of this concept, this study modified the existing fuzzy weighted average (FWA) nonlinear programming (NLP) approach by incorporating a mechanism of predicting a patient’s unknown preferences for different nearby clinics to improve the performance of ubiquitous clinic recommendation. The proposed methodology was applied to a small region in Taiwan, and the experimental results confirmed its superiority over four existing methods in effectively improving the successful recommendation rates for patients in both training and testing groups. Comparing the results of the proposed methodology with those of the original FWA-NLP approach revealed that the proposed methodology has an advantage because of the mechanism of predicting patients’ unknown preferences.",

Second, a power level and packet size decision (PPD) algorithm is presented to decide the optimal packet size, by either minimizing the delay at a prescribed transmission power or minimizing energy consumption with a prescribed delay. Third, a global link decision (GLD) scheme is devised to improve overall reliability and decrease overall delay simultaneously through raising availability of battery energy within nodes. Theoretical analysis demonstrated the validity of the GLD scheme. Moreover, experimental results show that the GLD scheme improves the transmission reliability by 8.70% and decreases the delay by 7.74%, without reducing the network lifetime, which was not achieved in previous research studies.",

abstract = "This paper presents an innovative and cost-effective scheme for examining on line the degree of misalignment of a pair of linear guideway rails in a feed drive system. Prototype MEMS-based vibration detection modules were constructed and installed on the ball screw nut and linear guideway block. The ball screw preload was adjusted with four settings by changing ball sizes in this feed drive system. For each preload setting, a linear guideway rail was adjusted using feeler gauges to produce 11 misalignment statuses. The y-axis deviation caused by misalignment along the feed direction (x-axis) was measured with a dial gauge. For each preload and misalignment setting, the vibration signal was ascertained from the installed detection modules while the work table was driven by the controller. By analyzing the vibration signals from the detection module on the linear guideway block, we found that the characteristic frequency in a specific spectrum band could be used as a misalignment index. The characteristic frequencies exhibited a descending trend when the deviation was less than 40μm and an increasing trend when the deviation was 40–120μm. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using cost-effective sensing units to examine the parallelism or distinguish the deviation between the linear guideway rails without disassembling the work table. This could be valuable for machine intelligence applications in the automation industry.",

This raised key research challenges related to: robustness of data steaming methods under typical farm connectivity scenarios, and mapping and 3D rendering of AGRI-data in an engaging and intuitive way. The presentation of AGRI-data in a 3D and interactive context was explored using different visualisation techniques; currently the 2D presentation of AGRI- data is the dominant practice, despite the fact that mobile devices can now support sophisticated 3D graphics via programmable pipelines. The testing found that WebSockets were the most reliable streaming method for high resolution image/texture data. From our focus groups there was no single visualisation technique that was preferred demonstrating that a range of methods is a good way to satisfy a large user base. Improved 3D experience on mobile phones is set to revolutionize the multimedia market and a key challenge is identifying useful 3D visualisation methods and navigation tools that support the exploration of data driven 3D interactive visualisation frameworks for AGRI-data.",

Meanwhile, plenty of temperature-sensing devices were researched and developed. This paper firstly introduces a Ni thin film-based resistive temperature sensing device on a cylindrical PET monofilament which has excellent flexibility and a simple fabrication process in room temperature. The structure of the Ni resistive temperature-sensing device is very simple due to the Ni thin film deposition by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering which requires no pattern. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) indicates the temperature sensitivity of the Ni resistive temperature-sensing device. By calculating the resistance from I–V curves, the TCR shows a constant value of 2.44×10−3°C−1. Even after a repetitive bending and washing process of the PET monofilament which we report for the first time, the TCR maintains a high value ranging from 1.52×10−3°C−1 to 3.13×10−3°C−1. The results demonstrate that the PET monofilament combined with the Ni thin film can be a good candidate for a resistive temperature-sensing device.",

The specific aim of this paper is to provide the critical and basic cornerstones for an applicable interactive dashboard architecture as a supporting tool in a structured process of innovative city strategies and consequent enhanced socio-economic performance. A core element in the present paper is formed by a smart urban dashboard system that acts as an interactive navigation tool supporting operational choices of all stakeholders involved. This dashboard is able to integrate complex and ever-changing big data bases serving as ‘signposts’ of city intelligence (or i-city smartness) for daily or strategic decisions of all urban stakeholders. This study thus outlines successively the concept of smart i-cities in our ‘urban century’, the great potential of digital technology for managing big data in governing i-cities, and the foundations of an urban dashboard on the basis of the so-called Pentagon model as a policy strategy vehicle. Starting from extensive data on a broad set of global cities, the potential of this approach is exemplified by means of an illustrative application of a smart urban dashboard for the city of Stockholm.",

Thus, for these devices to become truly useful in disasters, it is important to understand factors that affect their acceptance by the public. Previous studies show that perceived usefulness is a clear antecedent of people’s acceptance of smart wearable devices. However, the underlying factors that affect perceived usefulness itself are not clearly known. Thus, the aim of this study is to fill this gap, and by doing so, to derive some practical implications for solution developers and governments. This study used structural equation modelling to analyse survey data collected from 647 respondents in Japan. We found that the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications of smart wearable devices was a strong predictor of their perceived usefulness of using these devices for disaster applications. Although indirect factors such as the ownership of ICT gadgets and the usage of social media also had some influences, most of their effects were mediated through increasing the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications. In other words, through appreciating the functions of the current applications of smart wearable devices, people can visualise the usefulness of these devices in disaster situations. That being said, we found that in parallel, people also had concerns on the privacy issues of these devices. These findings shed light on the promotion and development of this fast growing technology for disaster applications.",

A new multi-objective optimization approach was developed to leverage the complexity and scalability of radio resource allocation in large-scale radio access networks. A mathematical model of virtualized resource mapping in a heterogeneous radio access network is proposed in this study. We expanded the dynamic differential evolutionary algorithm by regulating the weight parameters of each objective with machine learning to solve the mathematical model. Our approach is evaluated comprehensively in terms of complexity and convergence, and simulations are conducted to verify the proposed approach and demonstrate that the unilateral value of our multi-objective optimization can mirror the results of single-objective optimizations.",

However, the challenges are still open for mobile users to receive computation from the cloud with satisfied quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. In this paper, we study computation offloading by using edge computing, which is a new paradigm to deliver computation to the edge of pervasive networks nearby mobile users. Without strong incentive in place, however, local edge servers may be reluctant to help offload computation. To stimulate cloud service operator and local edge server owners to participate in computation offloading, we formulate the interactions among cloud service operator and edge server owners as a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of cloud service operator and edge server owners by obtaining the optimal payment and computation offloading strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the game is guaranteed to reach a unique Nash equilibrium. We then design two computation offloading algorithms that can quantify their efficiencies in terms of low delay and reduced complexity. Additionally, we extend our work by considering that edge server owners dynamically join or leave computation offloading. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms perform well in computation offloading and efficiently stimulate edge server owners to make contribution to computation offloading.",

Whereas, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, wireless sensor networks utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely cognitive wireless sensor network (CWSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. A major challenge in CWSN is maximizing its network lifetime by appropriate power control mechanism. To solve the distributed power control issues in CWSN with imperfect information, a game-theoretic power control mechanism based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed according to the difference and independence of channel sensing results among users of cognitive wireless sensor network (UCWSNs). UCWSNs can use HMM to infer whether its competitors take part in the game, which improves the information accuracy of game and leads to an optimal transmission power. Moreover, to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) of UCWSNs for multimedia information, a utility function based on the tradeoff of signal to interference plus noise ratio and power efficiency is defined for the power control game. Simulation results indicate that the game-theoretic power control mechanism based on HMM can not only improve the power efficiency, but also meet the target SINR better compared with other methods.",

In this regard, a key aspect is the lack of a public repository of movement datasets that can be employed by the researchers as a common reference to compare and assess their proposals. This work describes UMAFall, a new dataset of movement traces acquired through the systematic emulation of a set of predefined ADLs (Activities of Daily Life) and falls. In opposition to other existing databases for FDSs, which only include the signals captured by one or two sensing points, the testbed deployed for the generation of UMAFall dataset incorporated five wearable sensing points, which were located on five different points of the body of the participants that developed the movements. As a consequence, the obtained data offer an interesting tool to investigate the importance of the sensor placement for the effectiveness of the detection decision in FDSs.",

Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop e-machine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine pilot assembly line, is being supported by a set of virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a CPS using an e-machine assembly station as a case study. The main contribution of the work is to further validate the CPS philosophy by extending the concept into practical applications in pilot production systems with prototype products.",

Therefore we propose a concept for separating environmental perception and modeling from the application logic. We apply a general model related to the idea of “mental models” used in cognitive science. It combines geometrical data with knowledge about sensors and actuators. This model is used to derive all information, which is required by an application, and to generate different environmental representations. We show that this approach is capable of solving different problems in the fields of distributed systems as well as instrumented environments and demonstrate its usability.",

To address this problem, a range of electronic pillbox devices has been developed. Although these may offer a partial solution to this problem by ameliorating the issue of failing memory, it is important to have a full picture of medication adherence that includes other aspects besides forgetfulness. This article proposes an empathetic u-pillbox system that aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing systems in ensuring adherence to a medication regime and makes an effort to design a holistic elderly healthcare framework by supporting additional functionalities like providing personalized services to the elderly based on an awareness of their individual situations by placing emphases on understanding of the elderly and provision of humanistic care. This system consists of three main processes: data acquisition of the elderly situation and medicine taking state; data analysis and elderly model enhancement; and provision of empathetic services to the elderly, in which cyber-I, human model, data cycle for the spiral quality of model enhancement, knowledge fusion towards wisdom for providing smart services are our critical concepts and techniques. This article will describe the system by going through three scenarios concerning the elderly using and interacting with the proposed u-pillbox system. Although this system is designated for geriatric healthcare, it has a potential extension to general health monitoring and care at home. Moreover, there are many potential applications in clinic or hospital medication care systems. We believe the proposed framework to be a promising approach to one of the great social challenges facing societies in the 21st century.",

This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘(’omic)’ approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established’omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially SNPs and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.",

abstract = "Several companies have recently emerged to provide online Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) DNA analysis and sequencing. Those activities will be, in the near future, the foundations of the emerging Internet of Living Things. The concept of Internet of Living Things has been introduced to characterize networks of biological sequencing sensors, which could rely on cloud-based analysis capabilities, to support the users in deeply studying DNA or other molecules. Sequencing sensors have many fields of application and much more will likely to come. In this context, DNA microarray images represent the core of modern genomic data analysis, since they allow the simultaneous monitoring of many thousands of genes and represent a sort of “container”, not only for storing genomics data, but also for managing, sharing and exchanging such type of data. In this scenario, the ability to protect genomics and medical big data is a growing challenge. In particular, for what concerns DNA microarray images, the techniques commonly employed for data protection are not effective due for example to the unauthorized use or manipulation after decryption or the lost of metadata during image processing. In this paper we address the problem of protecting such type of information, by means of watermarking techniques. In particular, we propose reversible watermarking techniques explicitly tailored for the characteristics of DNA microarray images to ensure the protection of such images in terms of authenticity and integrity, besides enabling the binding of those imaging data with other information related to them. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques by means of a working prototype.",

abstract = "Residences for geriatric patients are usually understaffed, with each caregiver being in charge of several residents. A caregiver must assess the well being of residents and report to the medical staff if there is something unusual with a resident. Deviations from the routine will trigger an alarm, and automatic tools can help in making timely decisions. In this paper, we explore three visualization metaphors aiming at providing caregivers with an individualized overview of the activities carried out by residents in a given time frame. We postulate that this overview is sufficient to distinguish between normal and abnormal periods of time when visually compared in groups. We also present two automated approaches, data driven and knowledge driven respectively, to detect abnormalities. The visualization and the automated approaches are tested on a naturalistic dataset obtained from a long-term personalized sensing and annotation campaign in a residence for geriatric patients. Data is of two types, obtained from IoT infrastructure and wearables and from manual annotations made by the staff. Both approaches were empirically evaluated and validated in the paper. A side product of this research is a large repository of cleansed data from the sensing and annotation campaign for 45 older adults over a period of 39 months.",

abstract = "This paper presents one emerging social-technical innovation: The evolution of citizen-sensor-networks where citizens organize themselves from the ‘bottom up’, for the sake of confronting governance officials with measured information about environmental qualities. We have observed how citizen-sensor-networks have been initiated in the Netherlands in cases where official government monitoring and business organizations leave gaps. The formed citizen-sensor-networks collect information about issues that affect the local community in their quality-of-living. In particular, two community initiatives are described where the sensed environmental information, on noise pollution and gas-extraction induced earthquakes respectively, is published through networked geographic information methods. Both community initiatives pioneered in developing an approach that comprises the combined setting-up of sensor data flows, real-time map portals and community organization. Two particular cases are analyzed to trace the emergence and network operation of such ‘networked geo-information tools’ in practice: (1) The Groningen earthquake monitor, and (2) The Airplane Monitor Schiphol. In both cases, environmental 'externalities' of spatial-economic activities play an important role, having economic dimensions of national importance (e.g. gas extraction and national airport development) while simultaneously affecting the regional community with environmental consequences. The monitoring systems analyzed in this paper are established bottom-up, by citizens for citizens, to serve as ‘information power’ in dialogue with government institutions. The goal of this paper is to gain insight in how these citizen-sensor-networks come about: how the idea for establishing a sensor network originated, how their value gets recognized and adopted in the overall ‘system of governance’; to what extent they bring countervailing power against vested interests and established discourses to the table and influence power-laden conflicts over environmental pressures; and whether or not they achieve (some form of) institutionalization and, ultimately, policy change. We find that the studied-citizen-sensor networks gain strength by uniting efforts and activities in crowdsourcing data, providing factual, ‘objectivized data’ or ‘evidence’ of the situation ‘on the ground’ on a matter of local community-wide concern. By filling an information need of the local community, a process of ‘collective sense-making’ combined with citizen empowerment could grow, which influenced societal discourse and challenged prevailing truth-claims of public institutions. In both cases similar, ‘competing’ web-portals were developed in response, both by the gas-extraction company and the airport. But with the citizen-sensor-networks alongside, we conclude there is a shift in power balance involved between government and affected communities, as the government no longer has information monopoly on environmental measurements.",

Steering and navigation tasks through an environment constitute an essential activity in our daily lives. They have a high degree of practical value in a variety of domains, such as public area design, architectural Wayfinding, geo-positioning and navigation, as well as urban planning and environmental design. At times, people with a visual impairment may also have problems in navigating autonomously and without personal assistance, especially in unknown environments (outdoor and indoor) using a smartphone. There could also be emergency situations in which the receiving of information in real time could be crucial. People with motor disabilities usually need information to avoid environments with obstacles, to arrive at a target or to manage touchscreens in daily activities and different environments. The use of landmarks is therefore vitally important in human navigation. Wayfinding systems must change, given that according to the United Nations (UN) Development Program, people with a disability represent around 10% of the world’s population, which is approximately 650 million people. Additionally, according to the World Health Organization, the world’s population of people 60 years of age and older has doubled since 1980 and is predicted to reach 2 billion by 2050. Most Wayfinding applications in the Smartphone market suffer from at least one of the following problems: the information is not dynamic, the design is not universal or the interface is not adapted to different users and preferences. Accordingly, apps do not currently have a universal design. The GAWA platform provides a universal and accessible solution to manage Wayfinding applications that focuses on people with a disability in outdoor and indoor environments in Smartcities. According to the results, the platform could be used for performing activities in their daily lives.",

Unfortunately, flood management outcomes, based on the use of these hydrological infrastructure assets, are undermined by lack of data and resources to support decision makers. The aim of this study is to provide strategic action plans to address this problem. First, the study reviews literature on flood-related issues and interventions in several coastal mega-cities situated in developing nations. Then, outputs of the review are synthesized into threats, opportunities, weaknesses and strengths common to these cities in relation to infrastructure-based approach to flood management.

Latent realities are realities that exist, but are neither directly observable nor easily described by a single measure. In this paper, it is explained how VSP latent realities open up opportunities for global prosperity. Four contributions to the literature are made. Firstly, virtual-social-physical convergence (VSP) is explained in terms of convergence theories. Second, VSP latent realities are described in relation to relevant theories such as ecosystem edge effects. Third, VSP latent realities are related to international prosperity goals in terms of Resource-based Theory, Knowledge-based View, and Transaction Cost Economics. Fourth, it is argued that latent realities arising from VSP can be more important for increasing prosperity than physical realities arising from previous waves of technological convergence. VSP latent realities are related to practice in terms of macroeconomics and microeconomics. In addition, methodologies and foci for future research are discussed.",

A MBAN includes a set of sensor nodes deployed such, they can be located on, in, or around the patient body. They are used to monitor physiological signs, which are transmitted then to medical servers without hampering the patient activities. Security is one of the main challenging issues in MBANs since the data nature is highly sensitive. In order to ensure the reliable gathering of patient critical information, it is vital to provide authentication to prevent an attacker from impersonating legitimate sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a patient body motion based authentication solution. The routine activities, as walking or running, are characterized through a generic model allowing to identify the patient sensor nodes. Through the security analysis, we show its robustness against the well known attacks. In addition, we develop an analytical model to measure the impact of physical and logical attacks on the proposed solution with comparison to the existing protocols. We also evaluate the proposed solution through simulations with respect of important criteria, namely the transmission overhead, response time and energy consumption. The proposed solution demonstrates the best results in performance with comparison to the existing protocols. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype of the proposed solution, where it demonstrates promising results in terms of true acceptation and false rejection.",

Both revealed and stated preference datasets from a survey of U.S. drivers are used. The multivariate probit model and Bayesian estimation method are used to analyze consumer preferences. The results showed different preferences depending on socio-demographics and vehicle types. This paper provides marketing strategies for smart key functions and car–home connectivity functions by revealing socio-demographic characteristics and consumer preferences.",

This study investigates the causes of the contradicting results by analyzing the process, productivity, and economic benefits of BIM-based MTP through a case study. The process analysis results indicate that coordinating mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems took longer in MTP than in the conventional method because of the newly added offsite coordination activities. Nevertheless, the overall project duration was reduced because of the parallel execution of MTP and concrete work. The productivity analysis shows that the newly added MTP activities also increased person-hours. However, as the assembly process was repeated, the required person-hours decreased by 40% from that of the initial stage because of the learning effect. The case study revealed that the management of coordination activities and the selection of projects were critical for the successful implementation of BIM-based MTP.",

Prior to participatory sensing, large-scale deployment complexities were found in wireless sensor networks when collecting data from widespread resources. Participatory sensing systems employ handheld devices as sensors to collect data from communities and transmit to the cloud, where data are further analyzed by expert systems. The processes involved in participatory sensing, such as data collection, transmission, analysis, and visualization, exhibit certain management issues. This study aims to identify big data management issues that must be addressed at the cloud side during data processing and storing and at the participant side during data collection and visualization. It then proposes a framework for big data management in participatory sensing to resolve the contemporary big data management issues on the basis of suggested principles. Moreover, this work presents case studies to elaborate the existence of the highlighted issues.

An innovation model can incorporate those three components to provide greater value to stakeholders, drive organizational growth, gain a competitive advantage and achieve greater end-user satisfaction. We investigated how an enterprise systems model for open innovation could be created based on existing innovation socio-technical frameworks and how that model may benefit the UK National Health Service (NHS). We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the NHS is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments. The model strategy comprises rewarding people with shopping vouchers (Tesco club card points or nectar points) each time they confirm or cancel a medical appointment online or by SMS text message. With this model, the NHS would improve the management of their resources, may improve the quality of service and may have higher user satisfaction. Nevertheless, future challenges may include the adaptation of current NHS business processes and the management of the collaboration with private organizations.",

Applications such as location-based services and quantified self harness such data to bring meaningful context to users’ behavior. As social applications are becoming prevalent, there is a trend for users to share their mobile data. The nature of online social networking poses new challenges for controlling access to private data, as compared to traditional enterprise systems. First, the user may have a large number of friends, each associated with a unique access policy. Second, the access control policies must be dynamic and fine-grained, i.e. they are content-based, as opposed to all-or-nothing. In this paper, we investigate the challenges in sharing of mobile data in social applications. We design and evaluate a middleware running on Google App Engine, named Mosco, that manages and facilitates sharing of mobile data in a privacy-preserving manner. We use Mosco to develop a location sharing and a health monitoring application. Mosco helps shorten the development process. Finally, we perform benchmarking experiments with Mosco, the results of which indicate small overhead and high scalability.",

Thus, the idea of computing an optimum threshold σoptimal2 on the shadowing variance (respectively γoptimal on the RSS values) which represent the edge between these two regions. This threshold, γoptimal, will indeed help to trade-off between using all nodes or only a subset of them for more accurate localization. The closed form expression for the failure rate, defined as the event when all RSS measures are below a threshold value, (RSS < γoptimal) is first derived. Then, we proposed a scheme for optimizing the choice between node selection and diversity approaches.",

Many clustering based cooperative transmission is adopted by various approach.

Although the range of application is wide, anomaly detection algorithms are usually domain specific and build on experts’ knowledge. Here a new signal processing algorithm – inspired by the deep learning paradigm – is presented that combines wavelets, neural networks, and Hilbert transform. The algorithm performs robustly and is transferable. The proposed neural network structure facilitates learning short and long-term pattern interdependencies; a task usually hard to accomplish using standard neural network training algorithms. The paper provides guidelines for selecting the neural network's buffer size, training algorithm, and anomaly detection features. The algorithm learns the system's normal behavior and does not require the existence of anomalous data for assessing its statistical significance. This is an essential attribute in applications that require customization. Anomalies are detected by analysing hierarchically the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the residual signal using probabilistic Receiver Operating Characteristics. The method is shown to be able to automatically detect anomalies in the Seismic Electrical Signal that could be used to predict earthquake activity. Furthermore, the method can be used in combination with crowdsourcing of smartphone data to locate road defects such as potholes and bumps for intervention and repair.",

Several studies have highlighted the need to maintain and build manufacturing capabilities to support economic growth and have linked a nation's as well as region's strength in manufacturing to its ability to innovate. In the U.S., where a manufacturing strategy has largely been absent for the past 25years, advanced manufacturing capabilities are now seen as essential to the development of new products and processes across a range of industries. Against this backdrop, Massachusetts presents an interesting case since manufacturing in this U.S. state is integral to several of its most important industry clusters, yet it is a high wage, high costs state that must compete globally. This research examines the pathways and opportunities for building and fostering innovation capacity among Massachusetts manufacturers, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We employ a systems approach to conduct analytic and empirical analyses that consider how knowledge and sources of innovation flow between key participants within the manufacturing innovation ecosystem. We find that the Massachusetts manufacturing innovation ecosystem is rich in terms of assets but relatively poor in terms of interconnectedness between those assets. In addition, rather than being focused on demand-driven innovation and technological upgrading for SMEs, non-market state-supported manufacturing intermediaries are primarily focused on supply-side, point solutions that work with individual firms rather than at a systems level.",

abstract = "Protecting data in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has been a longstanding challenge. The tradition Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is known for its high computation load which creates a significant challenge for resource constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Attribute Based Encryption Scheme (LABE) for mobile cloud-assisted CPS based on a proxy service architecture and a new ciphertext policy ABE. In particular, mobile devices will solely perform symmetric encryption by joining authentication and encryption proxy services encapsulated in RESTful. Encryption shall not need pairing and then ciphertext can be decrypted with one pairing. Security analysis shows that the proposed LABE is secure with fine grained access control and users revocation capability. The computation complexity shows that the proposed scheme imposes low overhead on mobile devices and performs very well in mobile cloud-assisted CPS.",

abstract = "The need to extend the features of Cloud computing to the edge of the network has fueled the development of new computing architectures, such as Fog computing. When put together, the combined and continuous use of fog and cloud computing, lays the foundation for a new and highly heterogeneous computing ecosystem, making the most out of both, cloud and fog. Incipient research efforts are devoted to propose a management architecture to properly manage such combination of resources, such as the reference architecture proposed by the OpenFog Consortium or the recent Fog-to-Cloud (F2C). In this paper, we pay attention to such a combined ecosystem and particularly evaluate the potential benefits of F2C in dynamic scenarios, considering computing resources mobility and different traffic patterns. By means of extensive simulations we specifically study the aspects of service response time, network bandwidth occupancy, power consumption and service disruption probability. The results indicate that a combined fog-to-cloud architecture brings significant performance benefits in comparison with the traditional standalone Cloud, e.g., over 50% reduction in terms of power consumption.",

abstract = "Objective
To construct a substantive theory of postpartum fatigue.
Design
Grounded theory.
Setting
Participants were recruited in the hospital after delivery and interviewed in their homes.
Participants
Thirteen primiparae (n = 5) and multiparae (n = 8) women between 2 and 5 weeks postpartum from diverse ethnic, age, obstetric, and financial contexts were theoretically sampled.
Results
Persevering was the central human process around which the grounded theory emerged. The process of persevering was explained through the relationships of influencing factors, postpartum fatigue, coping techniques, self‐transcendence, and caregiving. Participants persevered in caregiving of infants and older children in spite of an overwhelming desire to rest and sleep using self‐identified coping techniques in combination with the belief that their children brought purpose and meaning to their lives.
Conclusions
The theory “Persevering Through Postpartum Fatigue” contributes a more complete understanding of the complex phenomenon of postpartum fatigue as it is expressed in the everyday lives of women during the postpartum period. The results may be used to develop and implement health‐promoting nursing interventions to reduce postpartum fatigue and its health‐related consequences.",

These technological advancements have led to the widespread availability of information and the possibility to connect systems in unforeseen manner. There is a strong desire for smart(er) cities, buildings, devices, factories, health monitoring – a smarter world. However, designing such a smarter world requires addressing also many challenges resulting from the emerging complex interactions and interoperation of systems. How is it possible to handle the increasing complexity during design and maintenance of such systems? How can one guarantee safety and performance of systems operating over networks which are subject to erroneous communication, delays, and failures of sensors and actuators? Is it possible to design control systems which allow for easy reconfiguration or even self-organization, for example by letting subsystems join and leave larger systems via plug and play strategies? Can one guarantee privacy of the controlled subsystems while exchanging information, which is necessary for maintaining overall system performance? We believe that predictive control is a well suited control approach to tackle some of these challenges due to its flexibility with respect to the formulation of the problem and the possibility to directly take constraints, preview information, as well as models of different complexity of the physical world into account. In this perspective we limit our attention to three areas we believe predictive control methods can provide a basis to tackle the appearing challenges: the efficient and easy implementation of predictive control on omnipresent embedded computation hardware, the question of resource and network aware control, as well as control on the network level of systems of systems. We briefly summarize results from these fields and outline some ideas on challenges, which arise.",

Building on the analysis of a dataset of 178 firms that use open government data across various industries in the U.S. we find twelve different atomic models. Additionally, our findings suggest that the way in which open government is used to create value is contingent to the firms' activities.

This has been no less true of ambient intelligence (AmI), which may be embedded everywhere in the not so distant future. Most of the scenarios developed by AmI enthusiasts have been rather ‘sunny’, showing how the new technologies promise to make our lives more efficient, enjoyable, productive, enriching. A European project, called Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence (SWAMI), deliberately developed ‘dark scenarios’ to highlight the threats to privacy, identity, trust, security and inclusiveness posed by the new technologies. The SWAMI consortium also developed a methodological structure for deconstructing and analysing the dark scenarios. This paper takes that approach a step further by applying it to a cultural artefact, partly to test the validity, utility, applicability of the SWAMI methodology to a scenario not constructed by the consortium and partly to show how some cultural artefacts can be regarded as scenarios in their own right as well as warnings about future technologies. The cultural artefact chosen here was the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report, because it features so many AmI technologies and draws attention to the issues that have been the focus of the SWAMI project.",

S-D logic can continue to advance over the next decade by moving toward further development of a general theory of the market and, even more broadly, to a general theory of value cocreation. To support this theory of the market requires developing more midrange theoretical frameworks and concepts of service exchange, resource integration, value cocreation, value determination, and institutions/ecosystems. These midrange theories can be partially informed by theories outside of marketing, including those under the rubrics of practice, evolutionary, complexity, ecological and structuration theories. Evidence-based research is also needed; opportunities exist in areas such as (1) strategy development and implementation (2) application of complexity economics and (3) the study of the service of cognitive mediators (assistants) as heuristic tools in complex service ecosystems. Additionally, opportunities exist for using S-D logic as a broader framework for the study of macromarketing, including ethics, economic, environmental and social sustainability, as well as public policy. For each of these, the further study of institutions and institutional arrangements, which facilitate coordination among actors in service ecosystems, is needed.",

This encompasses not just life at home but in particular the mobility of elderly people (e.g. when going for a walk or having sports) as well. Within this paper we will introduce a novel architecture for distributed AAL solutions whose design follows a modern Microservices approach by providing small core services instead of a monolithic application framework. The architecture comprises core services for sensor integration, and service discovery while supporting several communication models (periodic, sporadic, streaming). We extend the state-of-the-art by introducing a fault-tolerance model for our architecture on the basis of a fault-hypothesis describing the fault-containment regions (FCRs) with their respective failure modes and failure rates in order to support safety-critical AAL applications.",

Static and dynamic signs cover the above mentioned issues, but the place, where such signs are installed is crucial.

Each service point — from check-in through security check to boarding — has been designed using curved layout design and furniture along with large displays for information. The size of the displays is chosen such that passengers are able to recognize important information with respect to the specific service point at one glance. Waiting seats are surrounding the service point to provide an unhindered view to the displays and to promote communication. We implemented our design ideas in our artificial terminal building of an international airport. The impact of information displays is modeled by a microscopic simulation. Adopting the assumption that the information displays make it easier for the passengers to figure out the way through the terminal we simulate a whole day at the artificial terminal.",

abstract = "Increasingly the convergence of natural environment (land, water, air and life), built environment (housing, buildings, transportation and infrastructure) and digital environment (computing power, the internet, big data, and technology) is shaping the economies and societies. Smart living is taking root. Mass customization of products and services is preferred over mass production. Businesses wish to serve an individual customer at a competitive cost comparable to the mass production cost, with shortest possible development time and production time. This requires manufacturing to change from a more labour intensive processes to information technology enabled mechanical processes. Digital manufacturing is a broader concept of manufacturing innovation in which the digital and material advancements enable the company to conceive products in a desired style and quantity in time scales shorter than the conventional methods while efficiently managing the entire product lifecycle. It is about defining manufacturing processes and managing manufacturing process information via full digital product definition. It encompasses visualization, manufacturing simulation, ergonomic and human factor analyses, holistic view of product and process design, and product design sensitive to the process constraints and capabilities. This article emphasizes the need and driving forces for adopting digital manufacturing, transformation of manufacturing to smart manufacturing, present applications and future scope of digital manufacturing.",

The philosophy of value-in-use is that the value of products and services varies depending on the contexts where customers use the products and services. Based on this philosophy, products and services should apply to customer requirements depending on context. Context where customer uses the products and services is very often different from context assumed in design phase. Therefore, assumed value is very often not created. Changing customer's context is effective for solving this problem. This study finally aims to support context transformation by encouraging customer recognition. As the first step to achieve that, this paper proposes a method to analyze the context that prevents realization of the desired value proposition.",

They were, however, mainly designed for static scenarios and are therefore not well-suited for dynamic environments in which continuous reasoning over such heterogeneous knowledge with constantly arriving streams of data is necessary. In this paper, we introduce reactive multi-context systems (rMCSs), a framework for reactive reasoning in the presence of heterogeneous knowledge sources and data streams. We show that rMCSs are indeed well-suited for this purpose by illustrating how several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be handled using them, by showing how inconsistencies possibly occurring in the integration of multiple knowledge sources can be handled, and by arguing that the potential non-determinism of rMCSs can be avoided if needed using an alternative, more skeptical well-founded semantics instead with beneficial computational properties. We also investigate the computational complexity of various reasoning problems related to rMCSs. Finally, we discuss related work, and show that rMCSs do not only generalize mMCSs to dynamic settings, but also capture/extend relevant approaches w.r.t. dynamics in knowledge representation and stream reasoning.",

The first component of the National Institutes of Health to participate in the HPCC, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), recently issued a solicitation for proposals to address a range of issues, from privacy to ‘testbed’ networks, ‘virtual reality,’ and more. These efforts will build upon the NLM's extensive outreach program and other initiatives, including the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), MEDLARS, and Grateful Med. New Internet search tools are emerging, such as Gopher and ‘Knowbots’. Medicine will succeed in developing future intelligent agents to assist in utilizing computer networks.

abstract = "Recent human effort has been directed at expanding pervasive smart environments. For this, ubiquitous computing technology is introduced to provide all users with any service, anytime, anywhere, with any device, and under any network. However, high cost, long time consumption, extensive effort, and in some cases irrevocability are the main challenges and difficulties for developing ubiquitous systems. Therefore, one solution is to initially simulate, analyze, and validate practices prior to deploying sensing and computational devices in the real world. Simulation, as a performance evaluation technique, has attracted attentions due to its speed, cost-effectiveness, repeatability, scalability, flexibility, and ease of implementation. Moreover, emulation, as a hybrid method, not only offers most simulation advantages but also benefits from tight control of implementation, as well as a certain degree of realistic results. Both simulators and emulators are significant tools for enhancing the understanding of ubiquitous sensor networks (USNs) through testing and analyzing several scenarios prior to actual sensor placements. In this regard, this paper surveys 130 simulation and emulation environments and frameworks, which were originally designed and adapted for USN. Of these 130, the 22 that have been widely used, regularly updated, and well supported by their developers are compared based on multifarious criteria. Finally, several studies that had favorably compared the performance of simulators and/or emulators are examined. We believe the present research findings will be helpful for students and researchers to pick an appropriate simulator/emulator, and for software developers and those who are keen on producing their own environment.",

We investigated whether pattern matching of QRS loops in the 3-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) will improve the grouping of patients whose space-time electrical activity akin to each other, thereby assisting in clinical decision making. First, pattern dissimilarity of VCG QRS loops is qualitatively measured and characterized among patients, resulting in a 93×93 distance matrix of patient-to-patient dissimilarity. Each patient is then represented as a node in the network (or a star in the galaxy), but node locations are optimized to preserve the dissimilarity matrix. The optimization is achieved with a self-organizing algorithm that iteratively minimizes the network energy. Experimental results showed that patients’ locations converge as the representation error reaches a stable phase. The convergence is independent of initial locations of network nodes. Most importantly, 93 patients are automatically organized into 3 clusters of healthy control, LBBB, and infarction. Spatial coordinates of nodes (or patients) are evidently novel predictors that can be used in the computer-assisted detection of cardiac disorders. Self-organizing pattern matching is shown to have strong potentials for large-scale unsupervised learning of patient groups.",

Finally the WSS was placed in the workspace of a printed flexing packaging industrial installation and comparison with the already installed commercial detectors was performed. A very good agreement between the results of the two measurement systems is demonstrated. Additionally these results showed that the WSS is characterized by fast response with high repeatability and long-term stability. Concluding, this system is suitable for the targeted application.",

However, the limited memory and communication bandwidth offered by WSN platforms comprise a significant shortcoming to such demanding application scenarios. Although, data compression can mitigate such deficiencies there is a lack of objective and comprehensive evaluation of relative approaches and even more on specialized approaches targeting specific demanding applications. The research work presented in this paper focuses on implementing and offering an in-depth experimental study regarding prominent, already existing as well as novel proposed compression algorithms. All algorithms have been implemented in a common Matlab framework. A major contribution of this paper, that differentiates it from similar research efforts, is the employment of real world Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) datasets comprising the two most demanding Epilepsy modalities. Emphasis is put on WSN applications, thus the respective metrics focus on compression rate and execution latency for the selected datasets. The evaluation results reveal significant performance and behavioral characteristics of the algorithms related to their complexity and the relative negative effect on compression latency as opposed to the increased compression rate. It is noted that the proposed schemes managed to offer considerable advantage especially aiming to achieve the optimum tradeoff between compression rate-latency. Specifically, proposed algorithm managed to combine highly completive level of compression while ensuring minimum latency thus exhibiting real-time capabilities. Additionally, one of the proposed schemes is compared against state-of-the-art general-purpose compression algorithms also exhibiting considerable advantages as far as the compression rate is concerned.",

abstract = "The word “Waste” normally emphasis something around us which should be re-cycle, re-used, reduced or even eliminated, if possible. A giant amount of waste, such as: electronics/electrical items, manufacturing scrap, discarded constructional materials, polymers from daily needs, etc., is being generated day-by-day, whereas its treatment is lagging. The term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world. In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly reported. Zero Waste Manufacturing (ZWM) is believed as a roadmap for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of “Waste” can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing process, use of optimization tools and sustainable manufacturing theories, development of precision manufacturing systems, etc. This review article is taken up to discuss various recent sustainable manufacturing ideas applied in the prominent sectors with an aim to either re-cycle/re-use the discarded ones or to produce a fresh part in eco-friendly manners. Special attention is paid to the current trends in machining and a brief case study of sustainable manufacturing of aerospace industry has also been discussed.",

abstract = "In machine to machine (M2M) communication systems based on the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE), the machine type communication (MTC) devices compete in a random access channel (RACH) to access the network. An MTC device randomly chooses a preamble from a pool of preambles and transmits it during the RACH. The evolved node B (eNodeB) acknowledges the successful reception of a preamble if that preamble is transmitted by only one device. To reduce the burstiness of the connection requests in heavy traffic situations, access class barring (ACB) is proposed in the 3GPP standard. Using ACB, an MTC device postpones its request in a RACH with a probability p. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive ACB scheme for congestion control of bursty M2M traffic. The optimal value of the ACB depends on the total number of MTC devices competing in a RACH. To estimate this number, we derive a joint conditional probability distribution function (PDF) for the number of preambles selected by zero or one MTC device, conditioned on the number of MTC devices that passed the ACB check. We design a maximum likelihood estimator using this PDF. We use this estimation to dynamically adjust the ACB factor. To further improve our estimation, we use Kalman filtering based on the dynamics of the system for both known and unknown arrival distribution. In addition, for each device, we derive an approximate expression for the PDF of the delay to access the random channel. At the end, an energy consumption scheme for each MTC device is proposed while the access delay should not exceed from a maximum allowable threshold. Numerical results validate our proposed schemes and show that the total service time for the proposed method is very close to the optimal case where the information of the number of MTC devices is given.",

The models were calculated using EnergyPlus 8.6. The following technical specification parameters were assessed in the modelling: (i) solar collector efficiency; (ii) solar collector area; (iii) tank volume; (iv) tank heat loss; (v) electric back-up heating power rate; (vi) electric back-up heating position (height) for vertical tanks; and (vii) electric back-up heating temperature range. The site-specific parameters included: (i) solar collector direction; (ii) solar collector tilt angle; (iii) solar collector shadowing; (iv) solar collector dust accumulation; (v) hot water pipe insulation; (vi) hot water pipe length; (vii) electricity tariff time-of-use; and (viii) cold water temperature. User behaviour patterns were comprised of the following parameters: (i) end-use water temperature; (ii) end-use water demand; and (iii) end-use time-of-use. For all parameters, two system types were assessed, namely: (i) thermosiphon systems with natural (passive) circulation in collectors and unstratified horizontal hot water storage tanks; and (ii) split systems with forced (pumped) circulation in collectors and stratified vertical hot water storage tanks. The performance of SWHs was analysed considering both energy performance indicators (i.e. total and peak-hour energy consumption, solar fraction and energy intensity) and level of service indicators (i.e. compliance with recommended hot water temperatures for Legionella spp. control and comfort levels). Notwithstanding the prevalence of thermosiphon systems among SWH technologies, results indicate that split systems usually outperformed thermosiphon systems both in terms of energy efficiency and level of service, and hence should be a preferred option for energy efficiency initiatives and policies.",

The proposed novel concept envisions an integrated platform of providing a strong linkage between different stakeholders such as street lighting networks, landline telephone networks and future wireless networks, and is universal in nature being independent of the operating frequency bands and traffic types. The main motivating factors for the proposed small cell concept are the need of public infrastructure re-engineering, and the recent advances in several enabling technologies. First, we highlight the main concepts of the proposed UnISCell platform. Subsequently, we present two deployment scenarios for the proposed UnISCell concept considering infrastructure sharing and service sharing as important aspects. We then describe the key future technologies for enabling the proposed UnISCell concept and present a use case example with the help of numerical results.

A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets.",

Accelerometer and ECG signals were collected during polysomnographic studies (PSGs) including 18 individuals (25–53 years old) with no previous history of sleep disorders. Then, an experienced neurologist performed sleep staging on PSG data. Eleven features from HRV and accelerometry were extracted from series of different lengths. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to automatically distinguish sleep and wake. We found 7 min as the optimal signal length for classification, while maximizing specificity (wake detection). CACT and WACT provided similar accuracies (78% chest vs 77% wrist), larger than what yielded by HRV alone (66%).

Integrating tens-to-hundreds of computing elements that run at lower frequencies allows obtaining impressive performance capabilities at a reduced power consumption, that meets the size, weight and power (SWaP) budget of automotive systems. Unfortunately, the inherent architectural complexity of many-core platforms makes it almost impossible to derive real-time guarantees using “traditional” state-of-the-art techniques, ultimately preventing their adoption in real industrial settings. Having impressive average performances with no guaranteed bounds on the response times of the critical computing activities is of little if no use in safety-critical applications. Project Hercules will address this issue, and provide the required technological infrastructure to exploit the tremendous potential of embedded many-cores for the next generation of automotive systems. This work gives an overview of the integrated Hercules software framework, which allows achieving an order-of-magnitude of predictable performance on top of cutting-edge Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components (COTS).

Moreover, in the network coding algorithm of this protocol, we introduce a caching mechanism to improve the network’s performance as well as the video streaming quality. The comprehensive simulations show that the proposed protocol outperforms the traditional random network coding protocol by demonstrating a high improvement in video quality, redundancy of bandwidth usage, and reduction of the average frames loss in various video layers.",

abstract = "The Circular Economy (CE) has received considerable attention as an approach that promises to reconcile ecological systems and economic growth. In spite of its increased popularity, little is known about the implementation struggles of incumbent firms across industrial sectors. Furthermore, although the notion of circular production systems is at the intersection of different research areas such as sustainable product design, sustainable supply chains, and reverse logistics, knowledge on how these concepts combine to ease or impede firms' transition towards circularity is scarce. To shed light on these gaps, I used multiple case studies from Cradle to Cradle certified companies in the textile industry in Europe. By employing qualitative research, I identified a set of factors along the textile value chain, from product design to take-back and reprocessing, that are crucial in expediting or delaying a firm's aspirations to develop a circular product. The main contribution of this paper is the dynamic understanding of how certain collaborative supplier-buyer innovation factors (i.e., supply chain position, power balance, and a shared vision) coupled with complex aspects in product design, namely in basic materials, architecture, and functionality, combine to determine the output speed and quantity of circular products to be sold, taken back, and ultimately regenerated.",

A total sample comprised all 315 students from 1995 to 1998. Data were collected by postal questionnaires and by two focus group interviews. The responding sample of nurses, midwives and health visitors, all with a minimum of one years practice since completing the course totaled 145, achieving a response rate of 45%. Results. Evidence identified that practitioners were using research at a variety of levels to inform everyday practice. The skills developed in the course had transferred well to real life practice and a critical, confident, proactive approach within and across professional boundaries was demonstrated. A generally supportive culture was identified in the workplace but a lack of time and staff had prevented optimum utilisation of the new skills. A much more positive approach to research-based care was reported and many respondents stated that they had become more autonomous, accountable and better practitioners.",

The effects of extracting solvent (i.e. water, ethanol and methanol), flow rate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0mL·min−1), extraction temperature (60, 80 and 100°C) and time on extraction efficiency of coffee diterpenes were investigated. Quantification of diterpenes extracts was achieved by HPLC-UV method. The solvent flow rate was clearly the most significant process parameter. Diterpenes recovery resulted also influenced by temperature, except for the lowest flow rate, indicating solubility and mass transfer constraints. Kinetic degradation was also examined suggesting a thermolability of the diterpenes at 100°C. The optimum extraction conditions were 100°C and 3.0mL·min−1 using methanol. Under these conditions, PFE showed a remarkably higher efficiency compared with conventional extraction techniques.
Industrial relevance
Coffee is the world's most traded food commodity. Coffee-specific diterpenes (i.e. cafestol and kahweol) are high-value bioactive compounds, naturally occurring in the coffee lipid fraction. However, they are not easy to separate and likely to be unstable when isolated. High-pressure extraction, namely pressurized fluid extraction (PFE), appears as an attractive option as it reduces extraction time, thus avoiding degradation of thermolabile compounds, while requiring smaller quantities of solvent than traditional extraction methods (e.g. Soxhlet). PFE offers the possibility to operate with a wide range of liquid solvents well above their boiling point, but very little information can be found on the effect of operational conditions to efficiently recover coffee diterpenes. Such knowledge provides a basis for the rational design of PFE processes and, may be useful to allow industrial scale-up interpretation for coffee diterpenes extraction.",

Based on a national survey of American adults, this paper explores this question through considering both barriers to Internet use and the possibilities the Internet offers PWD. Findings indicate barriers for many PWD to accessing the Internet. Those with five of six types of disabilities measured are considerably less likely to be online than those who are not disabled. People who are deaf or hearing impaired to do not lag in Internet access once we account for demographics, Web use skills, and Internet experiences. However, the study also finds evidence that once online, PWD engage in a range of uses of the Internet as much as people without disability. Moreover, PWD take distinct interest in certain online activities, such as sharing their own content and reviewing products and services, pointing to ways they may go online to adapt and respond to the wider inaccessible society. These findings indicate great potential for the Internet for people with disabilities and suggest that moving more of them online holds the potential for considerable gains among this group.",

Le vieillissement de la population et l’augmentation des maladies chroniques génèrent de nouvelles problématiques en termes de parcours de soins. Ces problématiques associées au contexte économique actuel imposent un remaniement de notre système de santé pour péréniser son maintien. L’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la communication en santé (ou «e-santé»), poussée par des technologies matures et le gouvernement, est un des vecteurs d’aide à la mutation de notre système de soins. La prise en charge des pathologies cancéreuses est un domaine auquel les possibilités offertes par la e-santé s’appliquent tout particulièrement. Les prises en charge ambulatoires sont largement privilégiées avec des traitements rapidement évolutifs et complexes à la fois dans leur maniement et leurs toxicités. Ces nouvelles thérapies imposent donc un suivi de l’observance et une formation continue des professionnels de santé. Cet article propose d’exposer les fondements de l’e-santé et de la m-santé, sa composante mobile, puis de discuter leur place dans la prise en charge des pathologies cancéreuses, à la fois pour les patients et les professionnels de santé.
New information technologies and communication in health or “eHealth” is a way of improvement for management of chronic diseases. EHealth can improve patient care and care coordination especially in cancer patients who require a multidisciplinary approach. Treatments in oncology are complex and can result in new toxicities. Information of patients and of caregivers is a crucial issue. The patients require to be monitored and the caregivers need up-to-date information. The mobile component of eHealth: the mobile health or “mHealth” could provide to this need. This paper proposes to expose the principles of eHealth and its mobile component mHealth then to discuss their place in the management of cancer, for patients and caregivers.",

Since these assessments will become a mandatory exercise for those in control of data processing systems, they will become an important apparatus for the governance of new and emerging information technologies. This tool, and in particular the notion of “risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects” which is at its core, epitomises the shift from classical legal practice to more risk-based approaches. Merging risks and rights in the proposed fashion could change their meanings into something hardly predictable. This contribution proposes to explore the nature of the relation between both concepts within the assessment of a “risk to a right”. It will start by mapping out the various relations that exist between risks and rights in different practices. This should serve to identify gaps in the way DPIAs are currently operationalised and might well determine whether the introduction of this methodology in its current form might itself pose a risk to the rights of privacy and data protection. In turn however, it can provide opportunities for improvement and for lessons to be drawn from other practices and expertise that strike different relations between risks and rights, like the ones found in environmental governance and courts.",

Several emerging applications require that the sensors conform to curved 3-D surfaces and provide an improved spatial resolution through miniaturized dimensions. The proliferation of sensor applications also requires that the environmental impact from their manufacturing be minimized. This paper demonstrates and characterizes interdigitated capacitive touch sensors manufactured using an Aerosol Jet based additive technique that reduces waste and minimizes the use of harmful chemicals. The sensors are manufactured with the capacitive elements at an in-plane length scale of about 50μm by 1.5–5mm, a thickness of 0.5μm, and a native capacitance of a 1–5pF. The sensor capacitance variation is within 8% over multiple samples, establishing the repeatability of the Aerosol Jet method. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to characterize the sensor electrodes. 3-D electromagnetic simulations are carried out to predict the capacitance of the printed sensors and the electric field distribution. The simulations show a reasonable agreement with the experimental values of the sensors’ native capacitance (within 12.5%). The model shows the native capacitance to be relatively insensitive to the thickness of the sensor electrodes, allowing touch sensors to be fabricated with reduced material usage and cost. The model is further used to establish the important sensor dimensions governing its electrical performance. Lastly, electromagnetic field distribution predicted by the model is used to establish the physical range of the touch action to be about a millimeter out of the plane of the sensors for the geometries considered in the current work.",

Besides the use of supercomputers and clusters, grid and cloud computing can be used and thanks to today’s GPUs technology, many-core solutions can be integrated to speed up running times and add a lot more resources at users’ disposal. In this article, the development and simulation of a High Performance System based on Cloud, Clusters and low cost devices is presented. The system is simulated by using C and is tested in a real case scenario by utilizing the Java Parallel Processing Framework. The aim of this work is to study the possibilities of combining any available computational resource in order to reduce costs and energy consumption. We show that the combination of any resource that is available can result in a significant decrease in the execution time and expenses.",

Such a totalising prospect demands serious review and this article fills a critical gap by conceptualising the idea of e-lienation as a specific form of alienation in ICT-enabled tourism.

It then applies this framework to several divergent cases from the mobile services sector in which city governments are involved as part of their efforts in becoming “smarter cities”. By weighing the indicators for each case study, we can create a grid that allows for their direct comparison and gives an indication of diverging strategies. The newly introduced structured framework and its qualitative indicators are the main contribution of this work and can be used to set out or evaluate smart city strategies on a meso-level, as part of a broader policy exercise within cities.",

abstract = "A critical assumption in the vast literature on inventory management has been that the current level of inventory is known to the decision maker. Some of the most celebrated results such as the optimality of base-stock policies have been obtained under this assumption. Yet it is often the case in practice that the decision makers have incomplete or partial information about their inventory levels. The reasons for this are many: Inventory records or cash register information differ from actual inventory because of a variety of factors including transaction errors, theft, spoilage, misplacement, unobserved lost demands, and information delays. As a result, what are usually observed are some events or surrogate measures, called signals, related to the inventory level. These relationships can provide the distribution of current inventory levels. Therefore, the system state in the inventory control problems is not the current inventory level, but rather its distribution given the observed signals. Thus, the analysis for finding optimal production or ordering policies takes place generally in the space of probability distributions. The purpose of this paper is to review some recent developments in the analysis of inventory management problems with incomplete information.",

In this article, we introduce a new framework to guide potential evolution of the building stock in the next century, based on greenhouse gas emissions as the common thread to investigate the potential implications of new design paradigms, innovative operational strategies, and disruptive technologies. This framework emphasizes integration of multidisciplinary knowledge, scalability for mainstream buildings, and proactive approaches considering constraints and unknowns. The framework integrates the interrelated aspects of the built environment through a series of quantitative metrics that aim to improve environmental outcomes while optimizing building performance to achieve healthy, adaptive, and productive buildings.",

M2M refers to networks, which connect devices together and enable them to make a smart decision. The most viable option of implementing M2M communication is over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. A key challenge for M2M communication over the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the performance of Random Access Channel (RACH) because its operation was not designed with the enormous number of M2M devices in mind. To deal with the situation reduces network access success rate, several major access control methods were adopted. However, the suggested methods generally increase the access success rate regardless of delay requirements. On the other hand, access delay is crucial for many M2M applications such as healthcare. This paper investigates the effects of LTE Random Access Methods on healthcare M2M applications when enormous number of devices are introduced. The study clearly shows that to meet the requirements for delay sensitive M2M applications, the random access (RA) resources should be very strictly and carefully allocated.",

Owing to limited energy resources, 5G technology has been expected to be designed as a ‘green’ network system. To achieve the requirement of future ‘green’ 5G networks to serve a huge number of mobile devices, this work investigates the problem of deployment and sleep control of a ‘green’ heterogeneous cellular network along a highway composed of base stations (BSs), legacy relay stations (RSs), and small cells (SCs), with two objectives: minimizing the energy consumption to decrease the impact of limited energy; as well as minimizing the electromagnet pollution from radiation of the three device types to avoid the potential harm to creatures. For decision variables, the deployment and sleep control of legacy RSs and SCs affect the total power consumption, and their coverage affects the total electromagnet pollution. First, this work creates a mathematical model for the optimization problem, and then proposes a hybrid algorithm of genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE) with three local search operators to solve the problem, in which GA and DE can effectively handle discrete and continues decision variables, respectively. Simulation of the concerned green cellular networks verifies performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Salient new roles for policy-makers are outlined focused on orchestrating the policy-making process. Research directions are identified including understand the behavior of users, aggregating and analyzing content from scattered resources, and the effective use of the new tools. Understanding new policy-makers roles will help to bridge the gap between the potential of tools and technologies and the organizational realities and political contexts. We argue that many examples are available that enable learning from others, in both directions, developed countries experiences are useful for developing countries and experiences from the latter are valuable for the former countries.",

abstract = "Obesity is a global health issue that affects 2.1 billion people worldwide and has an economic impact of approximately $2 trillion. It is a disease that can make the aging process worse by impairing physical function, which can lead to people becoming more frail and immobile. Nevertheless, it is envisioned that technology can be used to aid in motivating behavioural changes to combat this preventable condition. The ubiquitous presence of wearable and mobile devices has enabled a continual stream of quantifiable data (e.g. physiological signals) to be collected about ourselves. This data can then be used to monitor physical activity to aid in self-reflection and motivation to alter behaviour. However, such information is susceptible to noise interference, which makes processing and extracting knowledge from such data challenging. This paper posits our approach that collects and processes physiological data that has been collected from tri-axial accelerometers and a heart-rate monitor, to detect physical activity. Furthermore, an end-user use case application has also been proposed that integrates these findings into a smartwatch visualization. This provides a method of visualising the results to the user so that they are able to gain an overview of their activity. The goal of the paper has been to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning in distinguishing physical activity. This has been achieved by (i) focusing on wearable sensors to collect data and using our methodology to process this raw lifelogging data so that features can be extracted/selected. (ii) Undertaking an evaluation between ten supervised learning classifiers to determine their accuracy in detecting human activity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, this evaluation has been performed across a baseline method and two other methods. (iii) Undertaking an evaluation of the processing time of the approach and the smartwatch battery and network cost analysis between transferring data from the smartwatch to the phone. The results of the classifier evaluations indicate that our approach shows an improvement on existing studies, with accuracies of up to 99% and sensitivities of 100%.",

Multipath routing with cross-layer approach appears to be a potential solution for supporting the distinct characteristics of WMSNs. However, due to the broadcast nature of the underlying medium, multiple paths are exposed to inter-path interference. In addition, low-power wireless links are asymmetric, error-prone and unreliable in nature. Consequently, an accurate and stable link quality estimation is essential to guarantee the performance of routing protocol. This paper proposes Triangle link quality metric and minimum inter-path Interference based Geographic Multipath Routing (TIGMR) protocol which finds multiple node-disjoint paths in IEEE 802.15.4 compliant network. This cross-layer routing protocol selects forwarding node based on a triangle link quality metric, remaining energy, and distance while anticipating minimum adjacent path interference effect. In addition, TIGMR protocol avoids Hidden Node Problem (HNP) at the sink node without using Request-To-Send/Clear-To-Send (RTS/CTS) handshake mechanism. Simulation results indicate TIGMR protocol optimizes overall performance and improves network lifetime as compared with state-of-the-art Two-Phase Geographic Forwarding (TPGF) and Link Quality and Energy-Aware Routing (LQEAR) protocols.",

The present paper forms part of this framework in considering that thousands of micro-sensor nodes are integrated into a precast concrete. Data management in the integrated sensor nodes requires Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) protocols development. We recently developed a data storage protocol, called USEE, for communicating materials.

Pure ZnWO4 nanostructures exhibited the highest sensitivity towards ethanol against Volatile Organic Compounds (methanol, acetone). Their lower limit of detection can reach 100 ppm for ethanol at temperature of about 23 °C. Pt nanoparticles play a positive effect in improving the sensitivity of ZnWO4 towards H2. After loading of Pt nanoparticles, the response of ZnWO4 nanorods towards 1.5% H2 increased from 1.4 to 12.5 at room temperature. In addition, the structure exhibits more significant promoting effect than nanoparticle structure because of their different microstructure and exposed crystallographic planes. Furthermore, Pt nanoparticles could eliminate the effect of ambient humidity to avoid the baseline shift. The gas sensing mechanism of PtZnWO4 nanocomposites is discussed detailedly at the same time. The generation of Schottky barrier at the interface between metal and semiconductor, as well as the formation of PtO on the surface of Pt nanoparticles contribute to the enhanced sensing response.",

abstract = "The software-driven assistance of elderly and impaired people in their every day life requires the integration of heterogeneous devices and assistive services. The lack of interoperability hampers the integration and usage of these devices and services. Furthermore, one objective in the field of Ambient Intelligence and Human Machine Interaction is the adaption of assistive services to the user 5. This is deeply rooted in the idea that the usage of ambient technologies still means a barrier for elderly and impaired people and prevents them to trust and use these technologies. But as these technologies aim at supporting and not restricting elderly and impaired people, a methodology is needed to overcome the barrier of using ambient assistive technologies. In this paper, we present an approach to a) enable a simplified integration of heterogeneous devices and services by the Web of Things recommendation and b) a lightweight AAL ontology together with a rule-based engine called Sherlock in order to demonstrate the advantages in representing and linking user intentions to device capabilities using Semantic Web technologies. Moreover, we show how this semantic representation in the context-aware Sherlock engine is used to derive user intentions by recognising device events. The practical applicability of the presented approach is demonstrated in a real-world use case from the AICASys project1.1See: http://www.mtidw.de/ueberblick-bekanntmachungen/ALS/aicasys",

abstract = "The automatic content-based classification of complex and dynamic urban sound is an important aspect of various emerging applications, such as surveillance, urban soundscape understanding and noise source identification, therefore the research topic has gained a lot of attention in recent years. The aim of this paper is to develop efficient machine learning-based scheme for urban sound classification in real-life noise conditions. Unlike conventional sound event classification methods that mainly address local temporal-spectral patterns, we propose an aggregation scheme to combine both local and global acoustic features. For characterizing local patterns, we employ feature learning method to extract class-dependent temporal-spectral structures; on the other hand, long-term descriptive statistics are employed to exploit global features of sound events, e.g. variability and recurrence, which also carry rich discriminant information. In order to aggregate the heterogeneous acoustic information for classification, we introduce mixture of experts model (MoE) which effectively formulates relationship between local and global information. At validation stage, we conduct experiments on UrbanSound8K database which consists of 10 categories of urban sound events with 8732 real-world clips. It is noteworthy that the 10 classes of crowdsourced recordings, including air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, drilling, engine idling, gunshot, jackhammer, siren and street music, are most common urban sounds closely related to urban life. According to experimental results, the proposed scheme achieved superior performance compared with 3 other latest approaches and it can be a fundamental building block of various urban multimedia information processing systems that help to improve quality of life.",

This demand varies in time and also between different buildings, yet, conventional methods are only able to provide mean energy levels per zone and are unable to capture this inhomogeneity, which is important to conserve energy. An additional challenge is that some of the attempts to conserve energy, through for example lowering of ventilation rates, have been shown to exacerbate another problem, which is unacceptable indoor air quality (IAQ). The rise of sensing technology over the past decade has shown potential to address both these issues simultaneously by providing high-resolution tempo-spatial data to systematically analyse the energy demand and its consumption as well as the impacts of measures taken to control energy consumption on IAQ. However, challenges remain in the development of affordable services for data analysis, deployment of large-scale real-time sensing network and responding through Building Energy Management Systems. This article presents the fundamental drivers behind the rise of sensing technology for the management of energy and IAQ in urban built environments, highlights major challenges for their large-scale deployment and identifies the research gaps that should be closed by future investigations.",

Despite the tremendous strides that have been made in the ICT sector, there has been a dearth of research on the factors linked to adolescents’ use of ICT for social interaction. The present study, therefore, drawing on data from the 2013 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) database and employing three-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) as an analytic strategy, examined the predictive effects of ICT-related behavioral and motivational characteristics on the frequency of use of ICT for social communication among 56209 early adolescents from 3132 schools in 20 ICLIS participating countries. The results of the three-level HLM analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, revealed that early adolescents’ ICT-related behavioral and motivational characteristics significantly and positively predicted their use of ICT for social communication. Specifically, Internet access at home, number of computers at home, learning of ICT tasks at school, use of specific ICT applications, use of ICT during lessons at school, use of ICT for recreation, ICT self-efficacy, and interest as well as enjoyment in using ICT significantly and positively predicted the use of ICT for social communication among early adolescents in 20 countries. Implications of the findings are discussed briefly for policy and practice.",

Bicycle sharing is increasingly popular as a sustainable transport system and the number of bike sharing schemes has grown significantly worldwide in recent years. One of the most important elements in implementation of these systems is the location of the stations. In fact the non-optimal locating of bike sharing compromises its success. Municipalities or public–private partnerships are mostly responsible for implementing bike-sharing schemes. The public investment in bicycle mobility (particularly bike-sharing) is complex because it is always subject to a budget. The main concern for public investment is to maximize the benefits through the design and implementation of bike-sharing systems. This work sets out a methodology to help with the decision-making of bike-sharing systems. The research work we present proposes using an optimization method to design the bike sharing system such that it maximizes the demand covered and takes the available budget as a constraint. It combines strategic decisions for locating bike-sharing stations and defining the dimension of the system (stations and number of bicycles) with operational decisions (relocating bicycles). As an outcome, the model determines the optimal location of the bicycle stations, the fleet size, the capacity of the stations and the number of bicycles in each station, considering an initial investment lower than the given budget. In addition, it balances the annual cost of the system and the revenue assuming a possible supplementary budget from the system provider to cover any loss resulting from the shortfall between its operating cost and the revenue from the subscription charges. A case study in Coimbra, Portugal, is presented and discussed.",

Traditional lifelogging PA measures require relatively high cost and can only be conducted in controlled or semi-controlled environments, though they exhibit remarkable precision of PA monitoring outcomes. Recent advancement of commercial wearable devices and smartphones for recording one’s lifelogging PA has popularized data capture in uncontrolled environments. However, due to diverse life patterns and heterogeneity of connected devices as well as the PA recognition accuracy, lifelogging PA data measured by wearable devices and mobile phones contains much uncertainty thereby limiting their adoption for healthcare studies. To improve the feasibility of PA tracking datasets from commercial wearable/mobile devices, this paper proposes a lifelogging PA intensity pattern decision making approach for lifelong PA measures. The method is to firstly remove some irregular uncertainties (IU) via an Ellipse fitting model, and then construct a series of monthly based hour-day density map images for representing PA intensity patterns with regular uncertainties (RU) on each month. Finally it explores Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence fusing information from these density map images for generating a decision making model of a final personal lifelogging PA intensity pattern. The approach has significantly reduced the uncertainties and incompleteness of datasets from third party devices. Two case studies on a mobile personalized healthcare platform MHA [1] connecting the mobile app Moves are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed approach can improve effectiveness of PA tracking devices or apps for various types of people who frequently use them as a healthcare indicator.",

In this context, the efficient processing of the big amounts of information, also known as Big Data forms a major challenge for both the research community and a wide variety of industrial sectors, involving security, health and financial applications. Serving these emerging needs, the current paper presents a Graph Analytics based Platform (GAP) that implements a top-down approach for the facilitation of Data Mining processes through the incorporation of state-of-the-art techniques, like behavioural clustering, interactive visualizations, multi-objective optimization, etc. The applicability of this platform is validated on 2 istinct real-world use cases, which can be considered as characteristic examples of modern Big Data problems, due to the vast amount of information they deal with. In particular, (i) the root cause analysis of a Denial of Service attack in the network of a mobile operator and (ii) the early detection of an emerging event or a hot topic in social media communities. In order to address the large volume of the data, the proposed application starts with an aggregated overview of the whole network and allows the operator to gradually focus on smaller sets of data, using different levels of abstraction. The proposed platform offers differentiation between different user behaviors that enable the analyst to obtain insight on the network’s operation and to extract the meaningful information in an effortless manner. Dynamic hypothesis formulation techniques exploited by graph traversing and pattern mining, enable the analyst to set concrete network-related hypotheses, and validate or reject them accordingly.",

However, it is important for location-based service provider (LBSP) to ensure user location privacy in the provision of such services. In this paper, we present a secure hitch service in location based social networks (LBSNs). To provide such a service, we propose a privacy-preserving proximity based location query (PPLQ) protocol, which is based on the hierarchical predicate encryption technique and the prefix membership verification technique. There are two types of users in this system, namely: the querier and the publisher. Our protocol allows a querier to query the location of publishers using multi-dimensional search, and it enforces distance based access control in the location queries. In order to improve the efficiency of our protocol, we use the multi-scale technique to represent user’s location information in the query condition and searchable index. The proposed protocol is designed to achieve multi-dimensional keyword search and bilateral private proximity testing simultaneously. Our protocol enables each user to independently define his/her own location policy for private proximity testing. In particular, we propose some solutions to reduce the search time cost of the CSP so that the time cost is acceptable for queriers. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the protocol using simulated data on the map of the city area of Changsha and a U.S. census dataset.",

There exist multiple models for the molecular absorption noise. Most of them focus only on the transformation of the absorbed energy directly into antenna temperature. This paper aims at giving additional perspectives to the molecular absorption noise. It is shown that the molecular absorption noise can be investigated with multiple different approaches, strongly affecting on the predicted strength and behavior of the noise. The full molecular absorption noise model is not given in this paper. Instead, we study the molecular absorption noise from different perspectives and give their derivations and the general ideas behind the noise modeling.",

abstract = "20years after the appearance of literature evidence and the launch of the first, pioneering cases, the smart city domain remains ambiguous and generates an increasing argument with regard to its feasibility and potential. Indeed, today the smart city domain is being characterized by an emerging market that provides novel solutions for cyber-physical integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that attempts to clarify the domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing network of city alliances, forums and market places that aim to bring together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to define a common urban future; and a promising international network of scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a “common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts and leaves out real community problems. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative international city cases that claim to be smart. The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials. The outcomes distinguish utopia from reality, introduce a pool of evidence that can justify whether a city can claim to be smart and depict a brief view of the future smart city.",

Integrating each employee into an organization's culture, including practices regarding the protection of information, is critical. Because active employee participation is important for security, managers may need to evaluate individual cultural values to motivate employees to perform secure behaviors. This study analyzes these potential differences by examining two individual characteristics—collectivism and psychological ownership of information—within the context of information-security-related behaviors. The results of this study indicate that an individual's personal orientation towards collectivism has an impact on psychological ownership and the intention not to perform secure behaviors. Furthermore, psychological ownership was shown to have a significant impact on the protection motivation constructs as well as on intention. The findings of this study contribute to information security research by studying collectivism's effect on psychological ownership and psychological ownership's impact on protection motivation.",

Environmental subsidies for replacement of new energy automobiles can promote consumption so as to boost its industry development. And the replacement can optimize private owned car stock to lower exhaust and improve environment.

However, distinctive features in M2M communications form different challenges from those in human-to-human communications. These challenges need to be addressed, or otherwise it is not easy for this paradigm to gain trust of people.

This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for representing the expected behavior of commercial off-the-shelf devices and applications, their interactions, and for detecting interference in pervasive computing systems. A set of home care scenarios is used to assess the applicability of this approach. We then provide two setups where this approach can be applied: (i) in a pre-deployment setup, where simulation is used to detect possible instances of interference, and (ii) at run-time, collecting observations from devices and applications and detecting interference as it occurs. For pre-deployment and simulation we use Opensim to recreate a home household. For run-time, we use Simple Network Management Protocol for systems state introspection and a sliding window mechanism to process the collected data-stream.",

The performance of such systems is mainly influenced by the architectural disposition and composition of the physical machines, the resource allocation and the scheduling of jobs and tasks. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the scheduling problem in distributed systems. The machine learning technique takes into consideration the heterogeneity of the nodes and their disposition within the grid, and the arrangement of tasks in a directed acyclic graph of dependencies, ultimately determining a scheduling policy for a better execution time.

However, every query for information issued from a smart home could adversely affect the privacy of its inhabitants. Since every Electronic Product Code assigned to RFID-equipped objects is unique, it is easily possible to create detailed and long-term customer profiles by linking queries on particular items to a specific person. In order to address the privacy problem, this paper proposes a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure for organized sharing and private querying of data, which is formed by many smart devices across several homes. The efficiency of this approach is examined with experiments involving several hundred nodes. Furthermore, larger peer-to-peer networks of smart home appliances are simulated. According to our evaluation, the proposed solution is able to satisfy real-time requirements in settings where smart devices are geographically close. Moreover, the architecture can be used to store information of nearly one million different products within a network of one thousand nodes, which is a reasonable size for a local collaborative infrastructure between smart homes in towns or cities.",

abstract = "Wireless multimedia sensor networks can provide valuable information for many monitoring and control applications, which can process scalar data, still images, audio and video streams. However, multimedia streaming is still very challenging for those networks, since energy constraints limit the attainable bandwidth for data packet transmissions. In some cases, dense sensor networks may have many source nodes streaming at the same time and such transmission demand may not be supported by the network protocols and defined links. Actually, for networks based on IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, multimedia streaming may be unfeasible for many scenarios, even with small numbers of sensors, severely restricting the deployment of multimedia sensor nodes. However, other standards as IEEE 802.11 could provide acceptable bandwidth for multimedia streaming, although energy efficiency is not a major concern for it. In this context, this paper proposes an energy-efficient approach that provides high bandwidth with optimized energy consumption, directly benefiting wireless multimedia sensor networks. A fuzzy-based solution is defined to determine whether Wi-Fi access points should be switched off when they are underutilized, reducing energy consumption while keeping network performance at acceptable levels.",

abstract = "In this paper, we present SlugCam, a solar-powered, wireless smart camera network that can be used in a variety of outdoor applications including video surveillance of public spaces, habitat and environmental monitoring, wildfire prevention and detection, to name a few. SlugCam was designed such that it can be deployed and left unattended for extended periods without requiring regular maintenance, e.g., frequent battery replacement. The system is built with off-the-shelf components which not only keeps it modular and low cost, but also facilitates its prototyping, rapid duplication, and evolution. SlugCam’s on-board processing capability allows computer vision software to run locally and autonomously. Energy efficiency in SlugCam is accomplished both in: (1) hardware by micro-managing low-power components; as well as in (2) software by having the system’s operation duty cycles automatically adapt to the current state of the battery in order to balance the trade-off between application-level requirements and power awareness. For example, SlugCam’s smart camera node changes its monitoring behavior based on how much battery charge remains. Additionally, using its computer vision software, the system only records and transmits information upon event detection which contributes both to the system’s energy efficiency as well as its low network bandwidth requirements. SlugCam’s networking functionality enables camera nodes to transfer video files, as well as collaborate on tasks such as visual processing, event detection, and object tracking. It allows node-to-node, as well as scoped- or full broadcast communication. For point-to-point communication, SlugCam uses on-demand power-aware multi-path routing to transfer video files efficiently. Another important contribution of SlugCam is to provide an open-source wireless camera network that can adapt to address the requirements of future outdoor video monitoring applications. SlugCam also includes a Web-based server where video data is stored as well as a Web-based user interface that allows end users to interact with the system, tag, query and retrieve video files, and manage SlugCam nodes remotely. In addition to a detailed description of SlugCam, this paper presents an extensive power characterization of the system’s operation and showcases its deployment in a lab testbed and a real world scenario.",

In this context, identification of susceptible factors and its spatial mapping is essential for evaluation of vulnerable hotspots. The present study assesses societal elements (socioeconomic and infrastructural) of vulnerability from potential cyclones for administrative blocks (units) of Odisha. Principal component analysis was used for reduction of a large number of variables into few indicative factors of vulnerability. Factor scores were mapped, and proximity analysis ascertains highly vulnerable blocks located in contiguity to coast. Additionally, spatial analysis was done using Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* to identify hotspots of vulnerability. Results reveal a substantial spatial variation in the distribution of vulnerable factors over space. The exploratory spatial analysis shown in this paper is an attempt to study societal attributes of vulnerability at a block level administrative unit in the Indian context. Further, this method could be used by local authorities to identify existing vulnerable blocks and prepare them to cope with potential hazard threats.",

abstract = "Socio-technical issues for Systems of Systems (SoS) differ in several ways from those for systems, mainly because the individual systems that are components of the SoS are usually owned by different organisations, each responsible for the optimisation and operation of its own system. Consequently, management of the SoS is about negotiation and management of the interfaces. Because of issues of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), commercial confidence, and the like, there is seldom sufficient, timely information in circulation about the SoS. Surprises are endemic to SoS, and resilience is a fundamental requirement. This paper outlines the different characteristics of SoS compared to ordinary systems, discusses many of the socio-technical issues involved, and then outlines a generic approach to these issues, treating the SoS as a ‘wicked problem’. Endemic to this is the need for governance, which is discussed briefly. This is followed by a description of the evident gaps in knowledge about the functioning of SoS, and a listing of tool classes, the development of which would enable progress to be made more effectively. Finally, the paper discusses how the SoS approach might be the best way to entrain ICT to address global drivers, thus pointing to the importance of the SoS approach.",

The agents can be deployed in large scale and hierarchical network environments crossing barriers transparently. The networks can consist of high- and low-resource nodes ranging from generic computers to microchips, and the supported network classes range from body area networks to the Internet including any kind of sensor and ambient network. Agents are represented by mobile program code that can be modified at run-time. The presented approach enables the development of sensor clouds and smart systems of the future integrated in daily use computing environments and the Internet. Agents can migrate between different hardware and software platforms by migrating the program code of the agent, embedding the state and the data of an agent, too. The entire information exchange and coordination of agents with other agents and the environment is performed by using a tuple space database. Beside architecture specific hardware and software implementations of the agent processing platform, there is a JavaScript (JS) implemen- tation layered on the top of a distributed management layer. The JS platform enables the integration of Multi-agent Systems (MAS) in Internet server and application environments (e.g., WEB browser). Agents can migrate transparently between hardware-level sensor networks and WEB browser applications or network servers and vice versa without any transformation required.",

Results showed that the sensing system is characterized by very good sensing performance with high repeatability and long-term stability.

Thus, an accurate and prompt analysis of customer requirements (CRs) in the early design stage is critical to its success. However, most OKP companies are small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to the limited resources and low product planning budget, they often cannot obtain abundant CR information nor can they afford the expense of complicated planning process. To address these issues, a system framework is proposed in support of OKP product planning process in a cloud-based design (CBD) environment. The challenges and future market niches of OKP companies are presented. The comparison of typical distributed systems shows that CBD, which utilizes advanced information technologies and business model, has advantages in providing sufficient resources, decreasing product development time span for OKP companies in a cost-efficient way. This article describes the proposed system architecture, the business interaction process and the information communication among customers, designers and marketing analysts at the product planning stage. To validate the proposed framework, a prototype system module MyProduct is under development in the CBD environment with an illustrative example.",

Different from most of the traditional methods, our proposed approach directly involves the competitive relationship among ISEs in the context of the availability of big data today. On the basis of the evidential reasoning (ER) approach and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency concept, we first construct a nonlinear programming model to portray the competitive relationship among ISEs, and obtain the optimal weight and the optimal utility value. Then, by applying the ER approach to the aggregate evaluation information, we obtain the ranking of the ISE CP performance. Finally, we use a numerical example to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the proposed approach and demonstrate its potential applications.",

To guarantee the ‘perpetual’ operation, the sensor node is supported by a hybrid power supply, which takes advantage of both wind and solar ambient energy sources to power the node and to charge the high capacity super capacitors that act as energy buffers. Using an electrochemical CO sensor, we secure the low power consumption of the node without degrading the sensing capabilities. We demonstrate our experience of operating the developed wireless sensor node in real conditions. Our solution can be applied for CO monitoring in urban areas and outdoor industrial facilities.",

Moreover, learning diagnosis is also a critical determinant in the acquisition, processing, and application of clinical skills in nursing practices. Bearing this in mind, this study aims to develop a mobile interactive learning and diagnosis (MILD) system to support problem-based learning (PBL) in a clinical nursing course based on the testing-based approach. Using mobile devices as a learning tool to integrate both real-world and digital-world resources for students and adopting PBL as a learning strategy to facilitate the development of the clinical problem solving skills. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in a foundations of nursing course at a nursing college in Taiwan. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is helpful to students in improving learning performance and reducing cognitive loads. Moreover, it was also found that most students showed positive perceptions toward the usage of the proposed system.",

Despite the recent advances in technology and information systems and the variety of methods for prognosis, decision models for joint maintenance and inventory optimization on the basis of real-time prognostic information have not been explored. We propose a proactive event-driven decision model for joint predictive maintenance and spare parts inventory optimization which addresses the Decide phase of the “Detect- Predict- Decide- Act” model and can be embedded to an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) for real-time processing in the frame of e-maintenance concept. The proposed approach was tested in a real manufacturing scenario in automotive lighting equipment industry and proved that maintenance and inventory costs can be significantly reduced by transforming the company's maintenance strategy from time-based to Condition Based Maintenance (CBM).",

abstract = "Detecting the anomalies timely in the condition monitoring data, which are highly relevant to the potential system faults, has become a research focus in many domains. Among the various detection methods available, the prediction-based algorithms are popular without using prior knowledge and expert labels. Additionally, these methods can take the time-ordered specialty into account which is highly significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. However, the detected feedback is binary, especially, due to the influence of inaccurate confidence interval (CI), the false alarm phenomena occur frequently based on predicted models. Thus this paper proposes an Uncertainty Fusion method to realize anomaly detection. Firstly, in order to estimate the data uncertainty, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is applied to perform the prediction with uncertainty presentation. Then, based on the GPR model, the improved k-fold cross-validation is combined to represent the model uncertainty. Moreover, the quantitative error index is designed to provide more detecting information for decision-making. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by different simulated and open-source data sets, as well as the real application in mobile traffic data detecting. The quantitative results on simulated data experiments show the proposed method can largely eliminate the false alarms without sacrificing much detection rate compared with the basic GPR model. Especially, the experiments on periodic data sets with high Signal Noise Ratio have the better performance. And the mobile traffic data detecting proves the Uncertainty Fusion method can expand the basic GPR model to meet the real industrial requirements.",

In sum, the main objective of TIM is to outline the processes behind continued technology use in an individual's everyday life. Here we present the model alongside a description of its scope and the relationships between constructs. This can help generate research questions relating to technology use while simultaneously addressing many previous shortcomings of existing models.

Barriers to adoption include high material and processing costs, low build rates, isotropic material properties, and variable processing conditions. Currently AM polymer parts are far less expensive to manufacture than AM metal parts, therefore improving the properties of polymer parts is highly desirable. This paper introduces a design methodology used to integrate continuous reinforcement into AM polymer parts with the aim of improving their mechanical properties. The method is validated with the design and testing of three case studies, a pulley housing, hook and universal joint used to demonstrate the applicability of the method for tensile, bending and torsion loading types respectively. Physical testing showed that it was possible to improve the strength of parts by over 4000%, elongation to failure by over 2000% and stiffness by approximately 200%. In addition a method of integrating condition monitoring capabilities into the parts was demonstrated. An analysis of the specific strength of the parts suggests that the reinforced parts are comparable to aluminium alloys, suggesting that in some cases AM polymer composite parts could supplant more costly metal parts.",

A well designed and efficiently developed Product-Service System (PSS) is a solid alternative to achieve this goal. The PSS design should search for new ways to add value for both company and customers. The PSS design model may help the company to innovate, strengthen competitiveness and assure the desired profit. In this paper we propose a methodology that integrates Design Thinking (DT) and Business Analytics (BA) in the PSS design in a way to build a profitable and lasting PSS. Design Thinking is a human-centered and systematic approach to problem solving and is used in the model to deeply understand customer needs and satisfy their emotional requirements considering company's resources and constraints. BA is the capacity to aggregate, to analyze and to use data in a way to optimize the business results. The large quantity of information available from sensors, logs and other machine sources, associated with information and communication technologies (ICT) advances allow companies to collect and analyze a large quantity of data. Through the data analysis, companies may evaluate consumer behavior, sense changes in the market quickly and identify new opportunities to innovate. Furthermore, companies may use the data as a third layer to add value besides the product and service layers. The proposed model addresses a lack in the literature of PSS design and adds relevant information for companies designing or reconfiguring a PSS.",

Unacceptably high water losses and non-revenue water threaten our water resource security as well as the financial viability of municipal water service provision. Traditional approaches of solving water loss problems are not enough to make a significant improvement; for this, new approaches involving increased automation and monitoring are needed. Furthermore, the sensory and automation ICT-overlay required for the WDN can itself be a cause of technical problems that also need to be solved before water utilities will implement these techniques. This paper propose a real-time dynamic hydraulic model (DHM) based control system connected to near real-time sensing and actuation capability on the WDN as an effective approach to implementing an efficient, reliable and adaptive WDN. This is in contrast to current design and operation of most WDNs that rely on steady-state hydraulic models which have inherent limitations with respect to reliability and efficiency.",

While the pathway to more resilience is promising and has many advocates, the response to crises and disasters, time and again reveals the challenges related to (i) ad-hoc switching from preparedness to response; (ii) ad-hoc connecting professional responders, communities, volunteers, and local authorities; and (iii) designing systems and tools that are tailored such that the feedback from local communities can be taken into account for coordination and planning. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed in designing crisis and disaster management information systems linking ad-hoc response to longer-term planning, in which networks of communities are at the core of the process.

abstract = "With the recent trend in wearable technology adoption, the security of these wearable devices has been the subject of scrutiny. Traditional cryptographic schemes such as key establishment schemes are not practical for deployment on the (resource-constrained) wearable devices, due to the limitations in their computational capabilities (e.g. limited battery life). Thus, in this study, we propose a lightweight and real-time key establishment scheme for wearable devices by leveraging the integrated accelerometer. Specifically, we introduce a novel way for users to initialize a shared key using random shakes/movements on their wearable devices. Construction of the real-time key is based on the users’ motion (e.g. walking), which does not require the data source for key construction in different devices worn by the same user to be matching. To address the known limitations on the regularity and predictability of gait, we propose a new quantization method to select data that involve noise and uncertain factors when generating secure random number. This enhances the security of the derived key. Our evaluations demonstrate that the matching rate of the shake-to-generate secret key is up to 91.00% and the corresponding generation rate is 2.027 bit/s, and devices worn on human participant’s chest, waist, wrist and carried in the participant’s pocket can generate 4.405, 4.089, 6.089 and 3.204 bits random number per second for key generation, respectively.",

abstract = "This paper describes the efforts involved in designing a common operating picture system for monitoring large-scale critical infrastructures. The design leverages the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion model to enable the integration of different critical infrastructure systems with their dependency relations. The resulting Situational Awareness of Critical Infrastructure and Networks (SACIN) framework offers a platform that provides a common operating picture of a critical infrastructure. A generic data collection component customized to each source system generates events and facilitates JDL level 0 integration. An analysis component collects events and data to produce meaningful information about the current state and future impact estimates in accordance with JDL levels 1 to 3. A brokered architecture supports level 4 control by various components and a JDL level 5 user interface is offered via a web application. Interviews of infrastructure subject matter experts were conducted to obtain the situational awareness requirements. By applying key situational awareness oriented design principles to the situational awareness requirements, a user interface was created for organizing information based on operator situational awareness needs and supporting key cognitive mechanisms that transform data into high levels of situational awareness. Situational awareness measures were used to assess operator performance during critical infrastructure tasks – a “freeze-probe” recall approach (Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT)), a post-trial subjective rating approach (Situational Awareness Rating Technique (SART)) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results indicate that the supply of attentional resources (SART supply) and overall SAGAT score best predict the performance levels of operators.",

The aim of this paper is to further establish the validity of the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q), as an effective instrument for measuring ISA. We present two studies to further establish the construct validity of this instrument. In Study 1, 112 university students completed the HAIS-Q and also took part in an empirical lab-based phishing experiment. Results indicated that participants who scored more highly on the HAIS-Q had better performance in the phishing experiment. This means the HAIS-Q can predict an aspect of information security behaviour, and provides evidence for its convergent validity. In Study 2, the HAIS-Q was administered to a larger and more representative population of 505 working Australians to further establish the construct validity of the instrument. The results of a factor analysis and other statistical techniques provide evidence for the validity of the HAIS-Q as a robust measure of ISA. We also describe the practical implications of the HAIS-Q, particularly how it could be used by information security practitioners.",

To explain this we discriminate between three objectives, often implied in the literature on technological neutrality of law. The first we call the compensation objective, which refers to the need to have technology specific law in place whenever specific technological designs threated the substance of human rights. The second we call the innovation objective, referring to the need to prevent legal rules from privileging or discriminating specific technological designs in ways that would stifle innovation. The third we call the sustainability objective, which refers to the need to enact legislation at the right level of abstraction, to prevent the law from becoming out of date all too soon. The argument that technology neutral law requires compensation in the form of technology specific law is built on a relational conception of technology, and we explain that though technology in itself is neither good nor bad, it is never neutral. We illustrate the relevance of the three objectives with a discussion of the EU cookie Directive of 2009. Finally we explain the salience of the legal obligation of Data Protection by Design in the proposed General Data Protection Regulation and test this against the compensation, innovation and sustainability objectives.",

Domestic recyclable resources (DRR) are the recyclable part of the household waste, and are recycled mainly by informal systems in many developing countries. The recycling system in China is a typical example which exist in formal and informal recycling systems simultaneously. Based on filed research, questionnaire survey and interview, this paper carefully studies the recycling paths, material flows and cash flows in the informal recycling system in Suzhou urban area, and aims to give targeted policy suggestions in the framework of Pressure–State–Response (PSR) model. Based on the result, the recycling rate in Suzhou urban area was about 22% in 2013. It is suggested for the government to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management by (1) giving professional training of the recycling practitioners and improving their recycling facilities, (2) giving the formal recycling channels a price advantage, (3) setting up information platforms, and (4) optimizing the layouts of recycling systems. These quantitate results and policy suggestions could be helpful to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management of the formal recycling systems.",

A mismatch is observed between the rapidly changing devices entering the market and the slowly evolving voluntary design policies, regulations, and e-waste processing business strategies. Conventional electronic waste (e-waste) management systems were historically optimized to extract high-value components from large products that were relatively easy to disassemble, but the products now entering the waste stream are more often light-weight mobile devices that are typically not covered by regulations or do not contain as high a concentration of valuable metals. This article proposes that transformations in the e-waste processing system aimed at closing the material loop should look to the circular processes found in natural ecosystems, which have evolved to optimize closed loop nutrient cycling. Like species in nature, e-waste processors make decisions about where and what to “eat,” balancing a food’s quality and abundance with the energy expended in obtaining it. Adapting the concept of optimal foraging theory, we demonstrate here a conceptual framework that draws parallels between foraging behavior in the ecological and industrial world, evaluates four potential mathematical models that case be applied to the e-waste case, and demonstrate how optimal foraging decisions can guide business, design, and end of life management toward circular economy goals in the consumer electronic system.",

Present-day wearables are typically battery-powered, and their limited lifetime has become the critical issue. Most devices need recharging every few days or even hours, falling short of the expectations for a truly satisfactory user experience. This paper presents the design, implementation and in-field evaluation of InfiniTime, a novel sensor-rich smart bracelet powered by energy harvesting. It is designed to achieve self-sustainability using solar cells with only modest indoor light levels and thermoelectric generators (TEG’s) with small temperature gradients from the body heat. The wearable device is equipped with an ultra-low power camera and a microphone, in addition to accelerometer and temperature sensors commonly used in commercial devices. Experimental characterization of the fully operational prototype demonstrates a wide range of energy optimization techniques used to achieve self-sustainability with harvested energy only. Our experiments in real-world scenarios show an average of up to 550μW for photovoltaic in indoor and 98μW for TEG with only 3° temperature gradient and up to 250μW for 5° gradient. Simulations using energy intake measurements from solar and TEG modules confirm that InfiniTime achieves self-sustainability with indoor lighting levels and body heat for several realistic applications featuring data acquisition from the on-board camera and multiple sensors, as well as visualization and wireless connectivity. The highly optimized low-power architecture of the presented prototype features image acquisitions at 1.15 frames per second, powered only from the energy harvesters.",

This organizing framework accommodates for any such changes as well as guides retailers about ways of increasing profitability in the future.

However, the challenge is that people have different needs (or attitudes toward smart homes), and provision should be tailored to individuals. A few studies have classified the functions of smart homes. Therefore, the Kano model is first adopted as a theoretical base to explore whether the functional classifications of smart homes are attractive or necessary, or both. Second, three models and test user attitudes toward three function types of smart homes are proposed. Based on the Kano model, the principal results, namely, two “Attractive Quality” and nine “Indifferent Quality” items, are found. Verification of the hypotheses also indicates that the entertainment, security, and automation functions are significantly correlated with the variables “perceive useful” and “attitude.” Cost consideration is negatively correlated with attitudes toward entertainment and automation. Results suggest that smart home providers should survey user needs for their product instead of merely producing smart homes based on the design of the builder or engineer.",

A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.",

A cyber-physical vulnerability impact analysis using decision trees then provides the manufacturer with a stoplight scale between low, medium, and high levels of cyber-physical vulnerabilities for each production process. The stoplight scale allows manufacturers to interpret assessment results in an intuitive way. Finally, a case study of the proposed approach at an applied manufacturing research facility and general recommendations to securing similar facilities from cyber-physical attacks are provided.",

abstract = "Background and objective
Computerized epileptic seizure detection is essential for expediting epilepsy diagnosis and research and for assisting medical professionals. Moreover, the implementation of an epilepsy monitoring device that has low power and is portable requires a reliable and successful seizure detection scheme. In this work, the problem of automated epilepsy seizure detection using singe-channel EEG signals has been addressed.
Methods
At first, segments of EEG signals are decomposed using a newly proposed signal processing scheme, namely complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Six spectral moments are extracted from the CEEMDAN mode functions and train and test matrices are formed afterward. These matrices are fed into the classifier to identify epileptic seizures from EEG signal segments. In this work, we implement an ensemble learning based machine learning algorithm, namely linear programming boosting (LPBoost) to perform classification.
Results
The efficacy of spectral features in the CEEMDAN domain is validated by graphical and statistical analyses. The performance of CEEMDAN is compared to those of its predecessors to further inspect its suitability. The effectiveness and the appropriateness of LPBoost are demonstrated as opposed to the commonly used classification models. Resubstitution and 10 fold cross-validation error analyses confirm the superior algorithm performance of the proposed scheme. The algorithmic performance of our epilepsy seizure identification scheme is also evaluated against state-of-the-art works in the literature. Experimental outcomes manifest that the proposed seizure detection scheme performs better than the existing works in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient.
Conclusion
It can be anticipated that owing to its use of only one channel of EEG signal, the proposed method will be suitable for device implementation, eliminate the onus of clinicians for analyzing a large bulk of data manually, and expedite epilepsy diagnosis.",

abstract = "Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.",

This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art of computational intelligence approaches in medical data and to categorize the existing CI techniques, used in medical fields, as single and hybrid. In addition, the techniques and methodologies, their limitations and performances are presented in this study. The limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for Computational Intelligence Medical Data (CIMD) in establishing an efficient CIMD architectural design. The results show that on the one hand Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) as a single based computational intelligence approach were the best methods in medical applications. On the other hand, the hybridization of SVM with other methods such as SVM-Genetic Algorithm (SVM-GA), SVM-Artificial Immune System (SVM-AIS), SVM-AIRS and fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) had great performances achieving better results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.",

This paradigm has opened the Service Cloud to a variety of wireless devices especially those with sensorial and actuating capabilities. Those pervasive networks contribute to build new context-aware applications that interpret the state of the physical world at real-time. However, traditional Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), which are widely used in the current Internet are unsuitable for such resource-constraint devices since they are too heavy. In this research paper, an internetworking approach is proposed in order to address that important issue. The main part of our proposal is the Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented (KASO) Middleware that has been designed for pervasive embedded networks. KASO Middleware implements a diversity of mechanisms, services and protocols which enable developers and business processing designers to deploy, expose, discover, compose, and orchestrate real-world services (i.e. services running on sensor/actuator devices). Moreover, KASO Middleware implements endpoints to offer those services to the Cloud in a REST manner. Our internetworking approach has been validated through a real healthcare telemonitoring system deployed in a sanatorium. The validation tests show that KASO Middleware successfully brings pervasive embedded networks to the Service Cloud.",

To protect data security, users encrypt data with message-locked encryption (MLE) to enable deduplication over ciphertexts. However, existing secure deduplication schemes suffer from security weakness (i.e., brute-force attacks) and fail to support flexible access control. The process of chunk-level MLE key generation and sharing exists potential privacy issues and heavy computation consumption. We propose EDedup, a similarity-aware encrypted deduplication scheme that supports flexible access control with revocation. Specifically, EDedup groups files into segments and performs server-aided MLE at segment-level, which exploits similarity via a representative hash (e.g., the min-hash) to reduce computation consumption. This nevertheless faces a new attack that an attacker gets keys by guessing the representative hash. And hence EDedup combines source-based similar-segment detection and target-based duplicate-chunk checking to resist attacks and guarantee deduplication efficiency. Furthermore, EDedup generates message-derived file keys for duplicate files to manage metadata. EDedup encrypts file keys via proxy-based attribute-based encryption, which reduces metadata storage overheads and implements flexible access control with revocation. Evaluation results demonstrate that EDedup improves the speed of MLE up to 10.9X and 0.36X compared with DupLESS-chunk and SecDep respectively. EDedup reduces metadata storage overheads by 39.9%–65.7% relative to REED.",

In the end, our goal is to analyse whether the technology is one of the leading industries in Romania or we still need to catch up compared to other EU countries. Moreover, if technology has imposed itself as a main drive for the economy, we also want to study the sustainability of this situation.

Indeed, they sustain development of numerous paradigms/ technologies such as distributed ambient intelligence, context-awareness and future mobile networking (e.g., B4G and 5G). Battery life remains one of the crucial problems to handle. In this article we propose an infrastructure-based topology using mobile ferries (mobile micro-base stations). In real life, a ferry could be robot, bus, tram, train or any other engine scrutinizing periodically a given area. Yet, message ferries are moving along concentric annulus and may collect data generated by the static sensors (could be classic sensors, smart meters, wearable devices, etc.) randomly distributed on given area. Next, transmissions are performed in a ferry-to-ferry forwarding scheme till arriving at the sink. Considered ferries could sense themselves data and therefore behave as mobile sensors allowing better awareness on the area state [1–3]. Our scheme could also assist Machine-to-Machine communications to increase the network lifetime, with potentially some cognitive-radio capabilities and opportunistic detection and access. Our proposal can easily be integrated in a smart-city for better interaction and green communications. Next, we present a queueing model (queues with finite capacity) to handle the generated traffic and to analyze the behavior of mobile ferries. We provided a close-form expression for both end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. The main objective of this work is to improve the energy efficiency of the cognitive sensors by asking cognitive sensors to not care about forwarding data of each other except for urgent data, this latter point is out of the scope of the paper. These static sensors will only care about data sensing, which will reduce their individual energy consumption.",

Electricity generation accounts for almost half of the emission; besides, conventional electrical production based on fossil fuel is becoming more and more expensive. One approach to significantly slow down global warming is to drive our society away from the current fossil fuel fiesta and use only renewable power such as solar and wind energy. Another approach is to improve the management of energy production, transmission, and distribution. Part of the latter solution is on the supply side, where one possible solution is to develop continent-wide smart power grids and energy storage systems. However, an equally important part of the solution is on the demand side, where technologies and applications that can work with this type of unpredictable energy consumption are becoming necessary. The smart power grid with new sources of data, fast growth of information, and proactive management requires new strategy for business and operational management. In this paper we discuss how Cloud computing model can be used for developing Smart Grid solutions. The Cloud computing model is based on the delivery of computing as a service, whereby storage, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a commodity over the Internet. The advantages of Cloud computing – reduced costs, increased storage, on-demand performance, and better flexibility – have motivated many companies in recent years to move their IT operations to the cloud; the same advantages can be used to achieve the most important future goals of a large-scale Smart Grid, such as energy savings, two-way communication, and demand resource management.",

Amid the numerous advances related to this development, a strategic and significant component is demand side management (DSM). Demand response can play an important and pertinent role in the milieu of DSM, and incentive-based demand response program (IBDRP) is getting customer focus in many parts of the world. This study tries to bring out major aspects to be considered while introducing IBDRP in retail electricity markets. Document analysis, a well-known qualitative research methodology, is used for analyzing various IBDRP schemes practiced globally, with the help of the ATLAS.ti software and utilizing the snowball sampling technique. For better understanding, the results of the axial coding are arranged in three stages: pre-implementation stage, implementation stage, and post-implementation stage. Based on the importance and their frequency of appearance, ten most prominent codes were identified, and the strength of their interrelationships is presented on a multilevel scale with three different ranks. One of the major and important outcomes of this research is that, with the help of the proposed conceptual framework, a proper implementation framework can be built, which can be used for developing most appropriate IBDRP for any retail electricity market.",

Recently, research has focused on secure data aggregation due to the open and hostile environment deployed. The Homomorphic Encryption (HE) scheme is extensively used to protect data confidentiality. However, HE-based data aggregation schemes have the following drawbacks: malleability, unauthorized aggregation, and limited aggregation functions. To solve these problems, we propose a secure data aggregation scheme by combining homomorphic encryption technology with a signature scheme. The proposed scheme makes three contributions. First, it achieves in-network false data filtering to avoid the consumption of unnecessary transmission energy. Second, it ensures authorized aggregation and the base station can identify the origin and validity of the messages received. Finally, the base station can recover the original sensing data, and thus can perform arbitrary aggregation operations. Comprehensive analyses and comparisons were conducted to prove the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme. The results show that our scheme performs effectively in terms of communication overhead, computational overhead, energy consumption, and delay. Additionally, even though the size of the aggregated results is large, our scheme enables the base station to quickly decrypt ciphertexts and obtain the original data unlike its counterparts.",

It is especially important to identify factors which affect citizen participation in waste reduction and recycling where waste policies are poorly implemented. In this paper we report the results of a research-constructed survey conducted in Xiamen, one of eight cities in China which have been operating waste source separation pilot programs since 2000. The results showed that while more than half of respondents were satisfied with local waste management, waste recycling was still inefficient and largely carried out by the informal sector. Satisfaction rates and basic residential house prices were positively correlated, and the satisfaction rate was higher in newly urbanizing areas than in old downtown and urban village areas. A structural equation model was used to identify key factors influencing citizen environmental willingness to participate in waste management, and this indicated that the most important influencing factor was citizen knowledge, followed by social motivation, while institutional factors had the smallest positive effect. Citizens who were better informed and lived in a community/family with more environmentally friendly behaviors have a greater propensity to participate in sustainable waste management. The model is useful for identifying causal relationships and ranking influencing factors in terms of their importance. The results indicate a waste policy hierarchy in Chinese cities, and future waste management should change from the current legislative-centered strategy. The results can be used to inform decision makers find locally effective strategies to improve public participation in waste management in accordance with socioeconomic and cultural conditions in China.",

abstract = "Background
Bariatric surgery research, often longitudinal, bears the challenge of maintaining retention and decreasing attrition of participants to avoid bias.
Objectives
To explore factors influencing the retention and attrition for bariatric surgical research participants.
Methods
Databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and others. As a secondary aim, studies reporting on retention/attrition factors in clinical follow-up visits were included.
Results
Of the 1145 articles retrieved, 44 met inclusion criteria, and underwent qualitative analysis. Four descriptive articles focused on longitudinal research participation and 40 on clinical follow-up visits. Willingness to participate in research was high (92%) and decreased with more invasive procedures or extra visits. A large observational longitudinal study presented 24-month retention/attrition data (92% for some data and 66% visit completion) and the retention strategies employed. One study indicated that research follow-up possibly increased clinical follow-up and another demonstrated a higher retention by increasing compensation. No consistent, modifiable demographic or psychosocial variables associated or predictive of retention or attrition in clinical follow-up were identified.
Conclusions
Research on factors related to participant retention and attrition is sparse. It is essential for studies to document retention/attrition data. Existing research has demonstrated a patient willingness to participate in research and that retention strategies have been successful in the short term. Further research should explore the motivations, perspectives and attitudes of bariatric surgical research participants regarding participation and explore predictors to develop evidence-based retention strategies. Research has yet to identify consistent and modifiable demographic or psychosocial variables predictive of clinical follow-up, possibly due to the heterogeneity of follow-up across studies. Further investigation into follow-up definition, content, counseling approaches, and new telemedicine technologies may prove helpful in developing predictors and evidence-based strategies. The relationship between research and clinical retention and attrition deserves further characterization.",

abstract = "In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one’s knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.",

In these highly fluid operational environments, involving information providers and consumers of various degrees of trust and intentions, information transformation, such as obfuscation, is used to manage the inferences that could be made to protect providers from misuses of the information they share, while still providing benefits to their information consumers. In this paper, we develop the initial principles for relating to inference management and the role that trust and obfuscation plays in it within the context of this emerging breed of applications. We start by extending the definitions of trust and obfuscation into this emerging application space. We, then, highlight their role as we move from the tightly-coupled to loosely-coupled sensory-inference systems and describe how quality, value and risk of information relate in collaborative and adversarial systems. Next, we discuss quality distortion illustrated through a human activity recognition sensory system. We then present a system architecture to support an inference firewall capability in a publish/subscribe system for sensory information and conclude with a discussion and closing remarks.",

abstract = "In wireless sensor networks, a mobile sink group brings out many challenging issues with regard to data dissemination due to its twofold mobility: group mobility and individual one. All member sinks of a group should move together toward the same destination in relation to the group mobility, but each member sink can also move randomly within a certain group area in relation to the individual mobility. For supporting such groups, geocasting may decrease data delivery ratio due to continuous group area shifting by the group mobility, and multicasting may increase energy consumption due to frequent multicast tree reconstructions by the individual sink mobility. Recently, mobile geocasting protocols have been proposed, which enable a mobile sink group to periodically register its current group area information to a source and member sinks in the group to passively receive data from the source by flooding within the registered group area. However, due to the passive data dissemination, they suffer from excessive energy consumption of sensor nodes due to flooding data within the large group area and result in high data delivery failures of member sinks on edge of the group due to asynchrony between the registered group area and the actual group area. Therefore, we propose an active data dissemination protocol that exploits a local data area constructed by considering the moving direction and pattern of a mobile sink group. In the proposed protocol, a source sends data to nodes in the local data area in advance, and member sinks in the group actively receive the data from the local data area when they potentially pass it. To efficiently construct a local data area, we investigate the pattern of group mobility and classify into three major categories according to the prediction level: a regular movement, a directional movement, and a random movement. We then present three different data dissemination schemes with an efficient local data area to effectively operate for each mobility pattern. Experimental results conducted in various environments show that the proposed protocol has better performance than previous protocols in terms of the data delivery ratio and the energy consumption.",

However, they are faced with the challenge of urban shrinkage due to the slowdown of economic growth in China, single industrial structure and the ‘boom and bust’ industrial cycle.

This paper reviews the current planning policies and practices in resource-based cities in China from the macro perspective, and analyses how the Government engages with the pressing economic problems faced by resource-based cities, in particular, focussing on economic restructuring. To further analyse the policies from Central Government and the diversification of practices in local contexts, this paper presents two case studies, a petroleum mining city (Daqing City) and a coal mining city (Pingxiang City). Through discussion and an evaluation of general and place-based policies and practices for resource-based cities, this paper aims to enhance the understanding of shrinking cities in China and shed light on the policy-making of economic development for other resource-based cities in developing countries.",

Despite its significance the effects of BD on decision-making quality has been given scant attention in the literature. In this paper factors influencing decision-making based on BD are identified using a case study. BD is collected from different sources that have various data qualities and are processed by various organizational entities resulting in the creation of a big data chain. The veracity (manipulation, noise), variety (heterogeneity of data) and velocity (constantly changing data sources) amplified by the size of big data calls for relational and contractual governance mechanisms to ensure BD quality and being able to contextualize data. The case study reveals that taking advantage of big data is an evolutionary process in which the gradually understanding of the potential of big data and the routinization of processes plays a crucial role.",

abstract = "Humankind has reached a level of ongoing crises, which is mainly due to an unsustainable energy system and the non-acceptance of planetary boundaries. On a more fundamental level the crisis is caused by the prevailing worldview and values. Universally accepted values of today emphasize material wellbeing and growth, consider nature only as resources to be exploited by humans, and neglect the notion that humans are connected to each other and to nature on a very fundamental basis. Currently, 140% of the resource and absorption capacity of planet earth is required for human activities and the trend is against rebalancing. The dire consequence will be a collapse of the hosting capacity of our planet, as a simple matter of fundamental environmental facts. This article draws a world which is mentally and ethically aware of the fundamental limits and the requirement to live in harmony with planet Earth. This describes an evolutionary development of humans and can be called a ‘New Consciousness’ scenario, akin to the concept of the Global Brain. Growth in this kind of a world is called neo-growth: it is environmentally sustainable and emphasizes social, immaterial and “spiritual” growth. Such an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable society is sketched and on that basis a very first estimate is given on the requirements and consequence for a fully sustainable energy supply which needs to be initiated now and fully realised in the second half of the 21st century. The technologies required are already available and their respective economics are no obstacle. It remains unclear and from today's perspective even improbable whether humankind is able to go for that evolutionary transition in the future. However, nearly all other options might end in a collapse scenario in the dimension of geological history.",

To identify the corrosion status of reinforced concrete (RC) structures, the fractional derivative (FD) theory is used to establish the integrated recognition algorithm. The electrochemical corrosion characteristics including dispersion and diffusion effects can be directly obtained in time domain. The effectiveness and accuracy of FD algorithm are verified numerically based on the results of complex-function-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, the robustness of FD algorithm is tested by the interference experiments of the white noise. The results indicate that the recognition algorithm established based on FD can successfully identify the corrosion status of RC structures in time domain.",

Through a content analysis of academic library strategic plans, this study examines the stated directions and goals of libraries to discover the extent to which they are monitoring and addressing emerging and traditional program and service areas, providing a perspective on how academic libraries are addressing current issues, and how they plan to allocate resources in response to trends. Academic libraries are facing enormous pressures that require them to respond and adapt in order to remain relevant. Rapid developments in technology, as well as changes in areas such as scholarly communication, data management, and higher education pedagogy are affecting user expectations and forcing academic libraries to develop new resources and service areas. At the same time, these libraries must balance new initiatives with core service areas such as instruction and collection development. In addition to responding to current trends, academic libraries are also being challenged to anticipate future needs and to develop innovative initiatives to meet those needs. No library can respond to every new trend in the field, nor should they. Decisions about how to prioritize and allocate resources should be aligned with the mission and goals of the library's parent institution. Colleges and universities are facing their own pressures, driven by increasing demands from stakeholders to hold themselves accountable, especially in terms of student outcomes such as persistence, graduation, and employment, as well as student learning outcomes, or changes in knowledge and behavior as a result of educational programs. In turn, these institutions are looking to their departments to demonstrate how their programs and services support and further the mission and goals of the college. In this environment, academic libraries must monitor both the trends in the library and information science field as well as those in higher education more generally in order to determine where to focus resources and efforts. But where are academic libraries generally placing their priorities right now, and to what extent are they responding to emerging trends? Library and information science (LIS) literature is rife with articles and reports that track trends in the field, make predictions, and advise libraries on how to implement plans and programs related to those trends. Few studies, however, have examined academic libraries' planning documents to see how they are prioritizing among the competing issues and challenges facing them. This study aims to address the gap in the literature. Through a content analysis of academic library strategic plans, this study examines the stated directions and goals of the library to discover the extent to which they are monitoring and addressing emerging and traditional program and service areas. Academic librarians and library directors will be interested to see which issues and challenges are receiving the most attention, and how their peers are prioritizing those areas. The study will also offer campus administrators a perspective on how academic libraries are addressing current issues, and how they plan to allocate resources in response to trends. Library faculty might also be interested in the results, as understanding which trends are having the most impact in their field could inform curricular decisions and program emphases.",

By means of a bottom-up approach, we show with scientific evidences that policy actions at product level have the potential to solve the apparent conundrum. The research is based on a case study related to the implementation of the European Union Ecodesign Directive to enterprise servers and data storage devices. The article proposes a novel approach to combine resource efficiency and data protection and cybersecurity issues, taking a preventative “by design” focus. This is built on the identification and subsequent proposal of solutions of the relevant market failures, i.e. situations in which the allocation of goods and services on a market is not efficient. Potential solutions are then translated into potential Ecodesign requirements for enterprise servers concerning: provision of information on the operation at high temperatures; availability of secure data deletion functionalities; availability of firmware updates to third parties; and design for disassembly of the product. We qualitatively and quantitatively assessed these requirements, in terms of energy and greenhouse gases emission savings, improved reusability, waste reduction, improved protection of personal data and security of the devices. The article concludes that a synergy between the environmental impact and the data protection and cybersecurity of these products – and the systems where they are installed (i.e. the data centres) – can be successfully achieved. Although the research work focused on a specific case study, the paper discusses finally how a similar approach could be applied to several other product groups characterised by similar market failures.",

Yet many countries' NIPs have resulted in tremendous societal benefit through both planned and unplanned action not associated with these goals. Socially important technology product platforms often are developed at facilities that are part of National Innovation Systems. Yet the policies that govern Social Entrepreneurial Action (SEA) at these facilities are unclear. If there is not a place for SEA in these facilities for technology transfer practice then there is cause for concern. Here we add to the growing literature on SEA by utilizing the case study method to investigate how SEA has been utilized by the US National Innovation Systems (NIS) for the benefit of society. We do this by investigating two cases which emphasize internal (corporate) and external SEA in a research facility within the US NIS. We demonstrate how a US national laboratory's external engagement of SEA led to one of the most important innovations of the last half of the 20th century – the Laminar Flow Clean Room. We also show how internal SEA led to the emergence of the National Institute for Nanotechnology Engineering (NINE). The “NINE program” created a pathway enabling the emergence of nascent policy makers, technologists and entrepreneurial professionals. We then provide a model for SEA at US national laboratories through technology able social innovators and identify a new type of internal and external social entrepreneur – the Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE).",

These data are essential to understand how ecologies and the labor of people in far flung places supply urban areas, as well as how these resource flows are used by whom, where, and for what purpose. Like other places, the state of California is struggling with issues of data privacy and access. Water scarcity and the state’s commitments to greenhouse gas emission (GHG) mandates raise the issue of consumption and the unequal burdens that derive from it. These mandates have unveiled the lack of comparable and verifiable data to understand crucial production-consumption dynamics. This paper illustrates how spatially-explicit big data can be harnessed to delineate an urban political-industrial ecology of resource flows. Based on research using address-level energy and water use consumption data for Los Angeles County, the analysis reveals how the region’s wealthy residents use a disproportionate share of the water and energy resources. The paper also identifies structural obstacles to increasing fees and taxes or altering property rights that would reduce this consumption and foster more equitable resource use. This study has implications for theory, method, and policy related to urban sustainability, which is unobtainable without first unraveling the political-industrial ecology of the material basis of urbanization processes.",

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”. The indices derived from the proposed approach are capable of uncovering the relationships between the individual technological sectors and provide numerical metrics to measure the presence of converging technologies.",

However, small middle-income countries have played a marginal role as recipients of R&D-related FDI despite increasing policy efforts. In particular, several Latin American countries have recently launched new policy programs with the aim of attracting this kind of investments, but it remains uncertain whether public incentives can be useful to compensate for other locational disadvantages. The case of Chile provides an interesting empirical setting to explore these issues because during the last decade its government has been actively promoting R&D-related FDI through a new policy mix. This article suggests that for national innovation systems to benefit from the attraction of internationally-mobile R&D it is critical for public policies to ensure that appropriate linkages are established with local actors that hold absorptive capacities. Equally important for a small emerging economy like Chile is to prioritize R&D-related FDI in strategic technology niches where the country can realistically attain critical mass.",

In order to determine whether this right has been affected in a specific situation, the so-called ‘non-interference’ principle is applied. Using this concept, it follows that the right to privacy is undermined if an ‘infringement’ with that right by a third party can be demonstrated. Although the ‘infringement’-criterion works well when applied to more traditional privacy violations, such as a third party entering the home of an individual or eavesdropping on a private conversation, with respect to modern data-driven technologies, it is often very difficult to demonstrate an actual and concrete ‘infringement’ on a person's right or freedom. Therefore, an increasing number of privacy scholars advocate the use of another principle, namely the republican idea of ‘non-domination’. At the core of this principle is not the question of whether there has been an ‘interference’ with a right; rather, it looks at existing power relations and the potential for the abuse of power. Interestingly, in recent times, the European Court of Human Rights seems to accept the republican approach to privacy when it deals with complex data-driven cases.",

Owing to extraordinary ferroelectric and dielectric properties, FTNG is acting as a highly efficient mechanical energy harvester. It is capable to capture several forms of abundant mechanical energy arising from human finger movements, machine vibrations and sound waves. As a proof of concept, under compressive deformation, FTNG is enable to instantly powers up several consumer electronics and thus provides a promising strategy for achieving self-powered electronic devices.",

This study looks into such personalized services that reflect different characteristics of a diverse range of residents who have different behavior patterns. Such services can increase the satisfaction of the residents by providing flexible services that take into account the lifestyle and circumstances of each resident. A problem with offering customized services, however, is that there is a dearth of data on individuals. Sufficient amount of data must be collected in order to determine what a proper service for an individual is. As such, this study explains the life-log data and discusses its collection method. The life-log data collected serves as crucial grounds for decision-making. How decisions are made using the life log data is an intriguing research topic. This study proposes and discusses logics and processes of various decision-making methods that can be executed using the life log-data. In their homes, residents tend to regularly display certain behaviors in patterns, which allows for identifying the residents’ behavior patterns, as well as the predicting the residents’ future behavior. In this aspect, the residents’ location, needs, and current behavior must be recognized in order to provide personalized services. As such, this study proposes decision-making method by verifying in-house behavior of Korean elderly with companion dogs in symbiosis homes.

In this paper, a literature review of the various impacts of logistics sprawl is provided with a detailed taxonomy of the impacts. It has been observed that logistics sprawl contributed changes in geography of urban freight, increasing trucks' travelled distance and consequent emissions and impacting the commuting of logistics employment. The paper presents a summary of the empirical findings illustrating the additional distance trucks travel due to logistics sprawl in several European and North American cities. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of the measures and policies implemented in various metropolitan areas to reintegrate small-scale logistics facilities within inner urban areas to act as consolidation centres.",

Building on evolutionary theories of innovation and the notion of general-purpose technologies, we examine how these changes affect Internet-based innovation. In this framework, we analyze the effects of network neutrality policies on innovation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that network neutrality regulations as currently implemented may impede and delay innovation experiments that require a differentiated quality of service arrangements. To overcome such undesirable effects on innovation, we propose an approach that allows safeguarding important goals of network neutrality while permitting a differentiation of network services in support of next-generation innovation.",

The appropriate intelligent lighting control plays a significant role in an energy-efficient and comfortable building environment. The novel concept of an illuminance matrix (I-matrix) is proposed and modeled as a precise expression of illuminance. This representation is more suitable for digital signal processing and high-precision lighting control. The I-matrix of a target working plane is obtained from several distributed photosensors using an RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural network. An optimization model is then constructed with a genetic algorithm to improve accuracy and reduce the number of sensors. Calculation results from a typical scene reveal that the proposed method is approximately 30–60% more accurate than conventional control practices. The application of the I-matrix is particularly essential for some places requiring a high quality of illuminance, such as an operation room, a cockpit, etc. As a criterion of illuminance quality, the I-matrix is a potential standard for high-quality lighting design, and opens new areas of research in lighting and human factors.",

Its success builds on the ability of MS to determine molecular weights of analytes, and elucidate their structures. However, sample handling prior to MS requires a lot of attention and labor. In this work we were aiming to automate processing samples for MS so that analyses could be conducted without much supervision of experienced analysts. The goal of this study was to develop a robotics and information technology-oriented platform that could control the whole analysis process including sample delivery, reaction-based assay, data acquisition, and interaction with the analyst. The proposed platform incorporates a robotic arm for handling sample vials delivered to the laboratory, and several auxiliary devices which facilitate and secure the analysis process. They include: multi-relay board, infrared sensors, photo-interrupters, gyroscopes, force sensors, fingerprint scanner, barcode scanner, touch screen panel, and internet interface. The control of all the building blocks is achieved through implementation of open-source electronics (Arduino), and enabled by custom-written programs in C language. The advantages of the proposed system include: low cost, simplicity, small size, as well as facile automation of sample delivery and processing without the intervention of the analyst. It is envisaged that this simple robotic system may be the forerunner of automated laboratories dedicated to mass spectrometric analysis of biological samples.",

This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big) data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty-four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.",

abstract = "This paper presents the evaluation of the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken.",

Europe and the U.S. lead the development of Smart Grids systems, while Brazil and India strongly depend on foreign technology and investment for their development in their countries. Climate change represents an extra challenge for developing countries, in addition to other issues related to economic and social advancement. Nevertheless, Smart Grids offer an array of possibilities and opportunities that work towards climate change international goals. However, state motivations and national energy resources limit the advancement of Smart Grids on this matter.",

Worker fatigue has been identified as one of the main contributing factors. Currently no independent and objective large data source is available that might support an analysis of this, or provide the basis for ongoing monitoring to further investigate. In order to successfully manage fatigue in the forestry workplace, we must identify suitable ways of detecting it. Industry partners are increasingly looking at monitoring solutions (particularly lightweight, wearable technology) that aim to measure worker activities and physiological metrics in order to determine if they are fatigued. In this article we present the results of studies which investigate whether or not such technology can capture meaningful data in a reliable way that is both practical and usable within the forestry domain. Two series of studies were undertaken with in-situ forestry workers using reaction and decision-making times as a measure of potential impairment, while considering activity levels (via step count and heart rate) and job-roles. We present the results of these studies and further provide a comparison of results across different ambient temperatures (winter vs. summer periods). The results of our studies suggest that it may not be possible to identify correlations between workloads (based on both physical and cognitive stresses) and fatigue measures using in-situ measurements as results are highly personalised to individual workers and can be misleading if the wider context is not also taken into consideration.",

The importance of this study lies in investigating the effects of using SNs in collaborative learning on learners, whether undergraduate or postgraduate, from many different aspects such as performance, interaction, socialization, collaboration, and decision making. Based on the results of this study, several decisions can be made such as applying blended learning or making better use of SNs in the field of teaching. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to achieve the research aim. The study is exploratory in nature and data was obtained from 300 Egyptian university students via structured questionnaire. Regression analysis and Mann Whitney U tests were performed to analyze the gathered data. The results support all hypotheses, except for the relationship between intention towards SNs and actual use in collaborative learning among undergraduate students. Further, no significant differences were found between undergraduate and postgraduate students with respect to all the proposed model constructs. The current study adds to the extent of literature in two respective ways. Firstly, testing and validating TAM in a developing culture; and secondly, although TAM has been extensively applied in evaluating the adoption of different technologies, few studies have exploited it on the adoption of SNs.",

Findings of the study suggest that the behaviour of the intermediaries manning these outlets, reliability of the outlet and facilities available at the outlet have significant effect on the service quality of the outlet, which in turn, has a positive effect on citizens' intention for availing e-Government services. Other factors of adoption that are identified to be significant are ease of obtaining service, usefulness of the outlet and positive word-of-mouth among the user community.",

This interface is potentiated by a BIM-based interface presenting real-time data of the building. The solution, called 3i buildings - Intelligent, Interactive, and Immersive Buildings, is a tool to monitor and manage smart buildings, as well as optimize users experience, energy consumptions and environment quality. This is achieved by a grid of sensors and devices that continuously gather information (structural conditions of the building, occupancy, comfort of occupants, energy consumptions and CO2, COV's and Humidity levels, etc.), which is processed by predictive models able to learn over time. The 3D representation of the models allows managers to take advantage of the virtual environment, by augmenting the facility model and including information about the facility, making it easier and perceptible to users and owners, helping them to make better decisions. To support our research, the system will be installed in three different environments, Luz's hospital, Lisbon Aquarium and Norte Shopping, to test the solution under different conditions, objectives and users. In the first two cases the objectives are to monitor building air quality, consumptions and occupancy and in the Norte Shopping case the objectives are to monitor people flows, interact with tem and help the response in case of crisis according to the adopted emergency plan. These types of systems might help reducing energy consumptions as well as increasing comfort and satisfaction of occupants, maintaining a constant concentration of CO2 and humidity within the facility. The optimized algorithms will allow the system to learn, predicting and reacting to different conditions, giving a more reliable and smooth response to occupants needs.",

The inertial switch consists of four main parts: a quartz wafer with anti-stiction strips as the substrate; a proof mass suspended by conjoined serpentine springs as the movable electrode; two L-shaped flexible cantilevers and a multi-hole crossbeam as horizontal and vertical fixed electrodes, respectively; two anchors located in the middle of proof mass as limit blocks. ANSYS software is used to simulate the dynamic contact process in the microswitch, and the simulation results reveal that the flexible fixed electrode can prolong the contact time and eliminate the rebound during the contact process. The axial disturbance among different sensitive directions has been discussed by dynamic simulation. The modal analysis, crosstalk between horizontal and vertical directions, cross-axis sensitivity, and the disturbance under overload shock along the reverse sensitive direction are also simulated and discussed. The suspension and gap in the device structure can be precisely controlled utilizing the photoresist modeled metal-electroplating technology to reduce the axial disturbance effectively. Finally, the prototype is fabricated successfully and tested by dropping hammer system. It is shown that the test threshold acceleration is 255–260g in horizontal directions (+x and +y), ∼75g in vertical direction. The contact time of the switch with elastic contact point is ∼60μs in horizontal direction and ∼80μs in vertical direction. The crosstalk between horizontal and vertical direction, cross-axis and overload disturbance have been also demonstrated by test results, which indicate the axial disturbance is low in the present inertial switch.",

However, IoV can also be extended to healthcare domain, where the patients can be provided healthcare services on-the-fly. We extend this novel concept in this paper and refer it as “Healthcare services on-the-fly”. The concept of game theory has been used among the vehicles to access the healthcare services while traveling. The vehicles act as players in the game and tend to form and split coalitions to access these services. Learning automata (LA) act as the players for interaction with the environment and take appropriate actions based on reward and penalty. Apart from this, Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling algorithm for efficient utilization of resources at cloud level has also been formulated. A stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model is used to represent the coalition formation and splitting with respect to availability of resources at cloud level. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the best, first, and random fit schemes.",

However, for many DTN applications such as distributing commercial content, targeting the best performance for only one index and neglecting the others is insufficient. A more practical solution would be to strike a balance between multiple of those performance indices. This paper introduces a Gain-aware Dissemination Protocol (GDP) which attempts to reach the maximum economic gain of content delivery by maintaining a balance between the value achieved via message delivery and the involved forwarding costs given out as user rebates. Economic gain from disseminating content is defined as the generated value upon content delivery minus its forwarding costs. The key concept behind the proposed protocol is to adaptively balance between dissemination latency and forwarding costs in order to maximize the economic gain. Using the DTN simulation software ONE, we characterize the GDP protocol with varying mobility models, content sources, and content generation times.",

In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of IURVs with different forms. Five case studies are presented of IURVs in the countries with the largest number of IURVs involving US universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of IURVs depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the IURV in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved.",

For each HCF type, research gaps and possible future directions are identified.

Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.",

It is expected that the deployment of future smart grids will allow two-way energy and information flows through plug-and-play operation of small distributed mobile power generators like electric vehicles (EVs) to benefit the prosumers and at the same time make the grid more efficient and robust. However, the issues associated with the energy and information transfer, battery technologies, battery charging schemes, their standards and management need to be addressed in order to achieve the full benefits of EV integration in the future smart grids and internet of energy (IoE) with local renewable generation. As the current grid with existing infrastructure cannot ensure maximum benefits from EVs, this paper reviews the EV technologies, their connectivity, impacts on grid and standards required for the efficient and economic operation of EVs with distributed energy resources in the IoE. The evolution, comparison, and storage potential of EV technologies are thoroughly discussed. This paper also extensively reviews the connectivity issues, for example current EV charging schemes, software tools required to design smart charging, associated challenges, and possible solutions. The architecture of distributed energy management schemes with EVs and the IoE is discussed in detail. Finally, the standards related to EV integration, energy transfers, and safety aspects are provided. Based on the comprehensive review, future directions are put forward which will be useful for researchers and engineers working with EVs.",

These mechanisms are not adaptive for MCC deployment; thus, it requires lightweight authentication methods. This paper reviews existing port-knocking authentication methods by analyzing the mechanism and classifying the methods into a thematic taxonomy. Current port-knocking authentication methods are compared based on static or dynamic knocked sequences, which tend to solve the Network Address Translation (NAT) knock and Denial of Service (DoS) knock attacks.

The manufacture of electronic products and their disposal at the end of their lives results in large quantities of waste products of varying degrees of toxicity that are difficult to deal with. Due to their high replacement rate, the lifespan of electronic products is spectacularly short. To reduce the environmental impact of electronic products the usual reduce-reuse-recycle (3R) trilogy appears to be insufficient. To achieve the objective of sustainable electronics, in this paper we suggest adding a fourth R for reconfigure. We recommend the use of the reconfiguration capacities of reconfigurable circuits such as FPGAs to reduce the functional obsolescence of electronic products by updating hardware. This paper is a survey of the sustainability of microelectronic. It presents some examples of pioneer works to illustrate the architecture of sustainable reconfigurable computing systems.",

Specifically, we propose the construction of synthetic indices using principal component analysis (PCA). The second idea attempts to anticipate the changes needed, especially with regard to data collection, to be introduced in current monitoring practices to assess a city's “smartness” accurately.

Software Engineering and Information Systems has established techniques, methods and technology over two decades to help achieve cloud service requirements, design, development, and testing.

Moreover, since these technologies foster users' independence, Smart Homes can be both an answer to an aging workforce and a large market for an aging customer base. Nonetheless, so far market adoption has mostly been limited to the luxury segment and the more basic stand-alone technologies. Therefore, the main question driving this study is why Smart Home technology is so scarcely implemented despite its benefits to an aging population. From the literature we derive key market barriers in Smart Home value networks. We expand on these findings by means of a value network analysis of a Dutch smart home implementation case. In addition, we conducted 14 interviews that provide more insight into the value network of specific Smart Home services. Based on our case findings we develop a generic value network for Smart Homes and propose opportunities to improve market adoption of Smart Home technologies.",

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose a concept for knowledge discovery in maintenance with focus on Big Data and analytics. The concept is called Maintenance Analytics (MA). MA focuses in the new knowledge discovery in maintenance. MA addresses the process of discovery, understanding, and communication of maintenance data from four time-related perspectives, i.e. 1) “Maintenance Descriptive Analytics (monitoring)”; 2) “Maintenance Diagnostic Analytics”; 3) “Maintenance Predictive Analytics”; and 4) “Maintenance Prescriptive analytics”.",

abstract = "Research interest on Information Centric Networking (ICN) has been sharply growing. Although new architectures, algorithms, and analytical models have been proposed, their evaluation remains often isolated and not rigorously verified by the research community. This paper initially portrays the composition of open source software tools available for ICN, certifying the predominance of Content Centric Networking (CCN)/Named Data Networking (NDN) simulators. Then, inspired by similar works related to the P2P field, it surveys related research papers to qualify the ICN literature produced so far, finding that a large fraction of contributions either uses custom, proprietary, and unavailable software, or even plainly fails to mention any information in this regard. By adopting a rigorous methodology, in the second part of the paper four simulators, namely ndnSIM, ccnSim, CCNPL-Sim, and Icarus, are cross-compared under several key aspects. Our findings confirm both their accuracy with respect to reference theoretical models in simple settings, and their consistency in more complex scenario. Additionally, our analysis can both assist researchers in the choice of the tool that best fits their needs, and provide guidelines to avoid common pitfalls in the ICN performance evaluation.",

In this context, the present contribution formulates a pioneering proposal, by drawing an advanced information centric platform for supporting the typical ICT services of a Smart City. It can easily embrace all available and upcoming wireless technologies, while enforcing, at the same time, ubiquitous and secure applications in many domains, such as, e-government and public administration, intelligent transportation systems, public safety, social, health-care, educational, building and urban planning, environmental, and energy and water management applications. All the details of the proposed approach have been carefully described by means of pragmatical use-cases, such as the management of administrative procedures, the starting of a new business in a given country, the navigation assistance, the signaling of an urban accident aimed at improving the public safety, the reservation of a medical examination, the remote assistance of patients, and the management of waste in a city. This description makes evident the real effectiveness of the present proposal in future urban environments.",

To achieve good service quality for crowd sensing applications, incentive mechanisms are indispensable to attract more participants to guarantee long-term extensive user participation. Most of existing research works apply only for instantaneous sensing data collections, where all participants׳ information are known as a priori. Thus, how to tackle long-term extensive user participation occurring in practical crowd sensing applications with the coverage constraint becomes peculiarly challenging. In this paper, we model the problem as a restless multi-armed bandit process rather than a regular auction, where users submit their sensing data to the platform (the campaign organizer) over time, and the platform chooses a subset of users to collect sensing data. Then, to maximize the social welfare satisfying the coverage constraint for the infinite horizonal continuous sensing, we design incentive schemes based on heterogeneous-belief values for joint social states and realtime throughput. Analysis results indicate that our schemes outperform the best existing solution.",

Researchers are enhancing the underlying activity discovery and recognition process by adding various dimensions and functionalities. But one significant barrier still persists which is collecting the ground truth information. Ground truth is very important to initialize a supervised learning of activities. Due to a large variety in number of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), acknowledging them in a supervised way is a non-trivial research problem. Most of the previous researches have referenced a subset of ADLs and to initialize their model, they acquire a vast amount of informative labeled training data. On the other hand to collect ground truth and differentiate ADLs, human intervention is indispensable. As a result it takes an immense effort and raises privacy concerns to collect a reasonable amount of labeled data. In this paper, we propose to use active learning to alleviate the labeling effort and ground truth data collection in activity recognition pipeline. We investigate and analyze different active learning strategies to scale activity recognition and propose a dynamic k-means clustering based active learning approach. Experimental results on real data traces from a retirement community-(IRB #HP-00064387) help validate the early promise of our approach.",

It nurtured political liberty in Europe; it ushered in the industrial revolution in Britain and then around the world; it raised incomes everywhere; and it cleared away centuries of obscurantism and superstition. But it also brought into being a ‘spirit of capitalism’ that is individualist, expansive, acquisitive, ruthlessly rational and insatiable. This spirit has been responsible for commodifying relations and turning the natural world into a ‘resource base’ on the one hand, and a sink for wastes at the other. The industrial scale of this objectification and destruction of the natural setting has proceeded to the point where it is global, and now threatens our industrial civilization with collapse. My purpose in this paper is to sketch an account of how industrial capitalism might be ‘naturalized’, so that it continues to grow and deliver improvements in the quality of life without destroying humankind's resource base, and the biosphere as well. My focus is on rules and institutions rather than policies or prescriptions. My argument is that a green economy is already growing within the old, fossil-fuel economy, and that through competitive dynamics it will dominate by mid-century – unless blocked politically by vested interests.",

Machines are limited in these abilities although various graph-based models have been used to link resources in the cyber space. The following are fundamental limitations of machine intelligence: (1) machines know few links and rules in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space, so it is not realistic to expect machines to discover laws and solve problems in these spaces; and, (2) machines can only process pre-designed algorithms and data structures in the cyber space. They are limited in ability to go beyond the cyber space, to learn linking rules, to know the effect of linking, and to explain computing results according to physical, physiological, psychological and socio laws. Linking various spaces will create a complex space — the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME. Diverse spaces will emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence. From multi-disciplinary perspective, this paper reviews previous ideas on various links, introduces the concept of cyber-physical society, proposes the ideal of the CP3SME including its definition, characteristics, and multi-disciplinary revolution, and explores the methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence. The methodology includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation. The CP3SME aims at an ideal environment for humans to live and work. Exploration will go beyond previous ideals on intelligence and computing.",

However, these systems usually operate in complex environments that entail uncertain, highly dynamic, or irregular workload. In such environments, autonomous agents tend to make decisions that lead to undesirable outcomes. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-logic-based adjustable autonomy (FLAA) model to manage the autonomy of multi-agent systems that are operating in complex environments. This model aims to facilitate the autonomy management of agents and help them make competent autonomous decisions. The FLAA model employs fuzzy logic to quantitatively measure and distribute autonomy among several agents based on their performance. We implement and test this model in the Automated Elderly Movements Monitoring (AEMM-Care) system, which uses agents to monitor the daily movement activities of elderly users and perform fall detection and prevention tasks in a complex environment. The test results show that the FLAA model improves the accuracy and performance of these agents in detecting and preventing falls.",

Quantified self and other similar movements involving wearable systems have gained recent interest. However, it is unclear what the clinical impact of these enabling technologies is on human gait. The purpose of this review is to assess clinical applications of wearable sensing and feedback for human gait and to identify areas of future research. Four electronic databases were searched to find articles employing wearable sensing or feedback for movements of the foot, ankle, shank, thigh, hip, pelvis, and trunk during gait. We retrieved 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria and identified four common clinical applications: (1) identifying movement disorders, (2) assessing surgical outcomes, (3) improving walking stability, and (4) reducing joint loading. Characteristics of knee and trunk motion were the most frequent gait parameters for both wearable sensing and wearable feedback. Most articles performed testing on healthy subjects, and the most prevalent patient populations were osteoarthritis, vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, and post-stroke hemiplegia. The most widely used wearable sensors were inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope packaged together) and goniometers. Haptic (touch) and auditory were the most common feedback sensations. This review highlights the current state of the literature and demonstrates substantial potential clinical benefits of wearable sensing and feedback. Future research should focus on wearable sensing and feedback in patient populations, in natural human environments outside the laboratory such as at home or work, and on continuous, long-term monitoring and intervention.",

Recently, researchers have proposed some 3-Dimensional RFID-based localization schemes, but most of them suffer from low efficiency. In this paper, we target at improving the efficiency of RFID-based localization, including energy efficiency and time efficiency, without sacrificing localization accuracy. The main idea is to adopt a “jumping probe” in distance estimation, based on which we propose the 3-Dimensional RFID-based localization schemes called JumpLoc, including a passive scheme two active schemes. In the passive JumpLoc scheme, a target tag will be located based on the estimated distances between itself and some reference readers. While the active schemes include basic and enhanced active JumpLoc schemes to locate a target reader. We numerically analyze the localization efficiency improvement of the proposed JumpLoc schemes. We also conduct simulations to validate their effectiveness, the results of which show that the passive JumpLoc scheme can improve the energy efficiency and time efficiency by at least 56% and 34% respectively, and the active JumpLoc schemes can improve the energy efficiency and time efficiency by at least 82% and 83% respectively.",

However, the real benefit is not related to the data itself, but with the algorithms that are capable of processing such data in a tolerable elapse time, and to extract valuable knowledge from it. Therefore, the use of Big Data Analytics tools provide very significant advantages to both industry and academia. The MapReduce programming framework can be stressed as the main paradigm related with such tools. It is mainly identified by carrying out a distributed execution for the sake of providing a high degree of scalability, together with a fault-tolerant scheme. In every MapReduce algorithm, first local models are learned with a subset of the original data within the so-called Map tasks. Then, the Reduce task is devoted to fuse the partial outputs generated by each Map. The ways of designing such fusion of information/models may have a strong impact in the quality of the final system. In this work, we will enumerate and analyze two alternative methodologies that may be found both in the specialized literature and in standard Machine Learning libraries for Big Data. Our main objective is to provide an introduction of the characteristics of these methodologies, as well as giving some guidelines for the design of novel algorithms in this field of research. Finally, a short experimental study will allow us to contrast the scalability issues for each type of process fusion in MapReduce for Big Data Analytics.",

The RAPP pilot cases involve the development of RApps for the NAO humanoid robot and the ANG-MED rollator targeting senior citizens that (a) are technology illiterate, (b) have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or (c) are in the process of hip fracture rehabilitation. Initial results establish the robustness of RAPP in addressing the needs of end users and developers, as well as its contribution in significantly increasing the quality of life of senior citizens.",

The emergence and existence of coverage holes in WSNs will dramatically degrade the network coverage performance and quality of service. To diminish the negative effects of coverage holes, this paper addresses and studies the confident information coverage hole detection problem (CICHD) based on the proposed novel confident information coverage model (CIC). For solving the CICHD problem, we design two effective heuristic CIC holes detection algorithms including the CHD without considering the nodes residual energy and the other CHDRE taking the nodes’ residual energy into account. In the both proposed algorithms, the sensing field is firstly partitioned into a series of reconstruction grids based on the spatial correlation and correlation range. Then each reconstruction grid will be scanned and detected based on the CIC model to be judged whether it is a hole. Once obtaining the coverage status of every reconstruction grid, the boundary of the coverage hole will be exacted by image processing method. The results of the simulations show that both the proposed schemes can efficiently detect the emerged coverage holes including the locations and the number, and the CHDRE algorithm is more practical and efficient compared to the CHD without considering the energy problem.",

abstract = "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one of the most important technologies in this century. As sensor nodes have limited energy resources, designing energy-efficient routing algorithms for WSNs has become the research focus. And because WSNs routing for maximizing the network lifetime is a NP-hard problem, many researchers try to optimize it with meta-heuristics. However, due to the uncertain variable number and strong constraints of WSNs routing problem, most meta-heuristics are inappropriate in designing routing algorithms for WSNs. This paper proposes an Improved Harmony Search Based Energy Efficient Routing Algorithm (IHSBEER) for WSNs, which is based on harmony search (HS) algorithm (a meta-heuristic). To address the WSNs routing problem with HS algorithm, several key improvements have been put forward: First of all, the encoding of harmony memory has been improved based on the characteristics of routing in WSNs. Secondly, the improvisation of a new harmony has also been improved. We have introduced dynamic adaptation for the parameter HMCR to avoid the prematurity in early generations and strengthen its local search ability in late generations. Meanwhile, the adjustment process of HS algorithm has been discarded to make the proposed routing algorithm containing less parameters. Thirdly, an effective local search strategy is proposed to enhance the local search ability, so as to improve the convergence speed and the accuracy of routing algorithm. In addition, an objective function model that considers both the energy consumption and the length of path is developed. The detailed descriptions and performance test results of the proposed approach are included. The experimental results clearly show the advantages of the proposed routing algorithm for WSNs.",

In this paper, an effective cloud computing architecture is proposed which predicts H1N1 infected patients and provides preventions to control infection rate. It consists of four processing components along with secure cloud storage medical database. The random decision tree is used to initially assess the infection in any patient depending on his/her symptoms. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to present the state of the outbreak. The proposed architecture is tested on synthetic data generated for two million users. The system provided 94% accuracy for the classification and around 81% of the resource utilization on Amazon EC2 cloud. The key point of the paper is the use of SNA graphs to calculate role of an infected user in spreading the outbreak known as Outbreak Role Index (ORI).

This work focuses on the application of location intelligence to simplify the modeling of data networks’ activity in such complex systems. It is essential to describe and understand when and where data is generated to effectively design, plan and manage communication networks. We introduce a model based on traffic generation rules and patterns to be applied over Geographic Information Systems data to create “dynamic data activity heat maps”.

Combined with the presence of pervasive coastal threats, such as flooding and erosion, this is having widespread impacts on coastal populations, infrastructure and ecosystems. For the right adaptive strategies to be adopted, and planning decisions to be made, rigorous evaluation of the available options is required. This evaluation hinges on the availability and use of suitable datasets. For knowledge to be derived from coastal datasets, such data needs to be combined and analysed in an effective manner. This paper reviews a wide range of literature relating to data-driven approaches to coastal risk evaluation, revealing how limitations have been imposed on many of these methods, due to restrictions in computing power and access to data. The rapidly emerging field of ‘Big Data’ can help overcome many of these hurdles. ‘Big Data’ involves powerful computer infrastructures, enabling storage, processing and real-time analysis of large volumes and varieties of data, in a fast and reliable manner. Through consideration of examples of how ‘Big Data’ technologies are being applied to fields related to coastal risk, it becomes apparent that geospatial Big Data solutions hold clear potential to improve the process of risk based decision making on the coast. ‘Big Data’ does not provide a stand-alone solution to the issues and gaps outlined in this paper, yet these technological methods hold the potential to optimise data-driven approaches, enabling robust risk profiles to be generated for coastal regions.",

The traditional approach of using GPS for location determination is not suitable for sensor networks, due to the increased costs and resource usage. For this reason, sensors exchange Radio Frequency messages, so as to measure their respective distances and determine their locations by means of multilateral triangulation with sensors of known positions, called anchors. Such an approach, however, is particularly vulnerable to several kinds of attacks aiming at causing wrong position estimations with a malicious intention. Such attacks can be tolerated with proper countermeasures, belonging to the so called secure localization, but this is achieved at the expenses of high costs in terms of exchanged messages and exhausted sensor resources, such as the battery. For these reasons, it is crucial to use the secure localization only when needed in order to extend considerably the life span of the sensors. Therefore, we propose to model the interaction of an anchor with a sensor as a signaling game, and to use such a formalization to discipline the use of secure positioning methods based on the received messages from the anchors. We have proved with simulations that such a solution is more efficient than a naive one of always applying secure localization.",

It became then clear that it was necessary to distribute the central management responsibilities throughout the network equipments. This article proposes an autonomic decision system with learning capabilities based on Artificial Intelligence concepts, to be used by network equipments in mesh-network environments without the need of a central knowledge. Considering a specific case of QoS routing, this system is able to establish bandwidth-aware communication paths between pairs of nodes in a distributed approach, without the complete knowledge of the network and the available bandwidth of its links. To develop this system in a real network an architecture has been specified and built, denote as DistArch. This architecture provides all the functionalities to perform distributed autonomic decisions in large-scale networks. The results of this approach show that, by cooperating with neighbour network agents, even without a full knowledge of the network state, it is possible to establish bandwidth-aware communication paths as optimal as the ones obtained with a central decision approach that contains full network information, being able to react to network changes with a fast convergence.",

Research on children’s environmental cognition and, latterly, spatial literacy, has been artificially and problematically separated from the majority of research in childhood studies. Our fundamental aim in this article is to argue for – and to evidence – greater attention to how spatial literacy and children’s everyday lives are embedded in one another. To support our broader call for a synthetic research agenda, we draw on some more focussed, qualitative empirical material taken from a large-scale project about children’s mobilities and everyday lives in newly-built urban communities. Our analysis focuses upon children’s interpretations of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracks of their mobilities, set against a background of Google Earth imagery. In doing so, we showcase one suite of ways in which research on environmental cognition and children’s geographies might proceed together. We demonstrate that children not only displayed analytical skills (for instance, in relation to scaling effects and pattern recognition) but that many also exercised higher-level, critical analysis, especially in relation to errors on Google Earth outputs. Simultaneously, we interrogate the recursive articulation of a range of qualitative indicators of spatial literacy, with children’s everyday mobilities, routines, emotions and memories. The paper analyses how new conceptual languages and technologies being propounded by spatial literacy scholars could afford a more enriched understanding of key contemporary concerns for children’s geographers, and, recursively, what spatial literacy scholars might gain from engaging with (especially qualitative) research prompted by those concerns.",

Originally, this approach was developed to integrate the business processes of an organization and more effectively manage and utilize the data generated during lifecycle studies. With emerging technologies, product embedded information devices such as radio frequency identification tags and smart sensors are widely used to improve the efficiency of enterprises' routine management on an operational level. Manufacturing enterprises need a more advanced analysis approach to develop a solution on a strategic level from using such lifecycle Big Data. However, the application of Big Data in lifecycle faces several challenges, such as the lack of reliable data and valuable knowledge that can be employed to support the optimized decision-making of product lifecycle management. In this paper, a framework for Big Data driven product lifecycle management was proposed to address these challenges. Within the proposed framework, the availability and accessibility of data and knowledge related to lifecycle can be achieved. A case study was presented to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework was feasible to be adopted in industry, and can provide an overall solution for optimizing the decision-making processes in different phases of the whole lifecycle. The key findings and insights from the case study were summarized as managerial implications, which can guide manufacturers to ensure improvements in energy saving and fault diagnosis related decisions in the whole lifecycle.",

With a trend of urbanisation apparent, increasing attention is now being given to understanding and shaping our cities to support an evolving society. Urban metabolism concerns the flows of material and non-material resources and wastes that characterise the functioning and sustainability of a city and which are fundamentally associated with human behaviour. This paper centres upon an examination of how the digital age is supporting and contributing to changing lifestyles and more particularly lifestyle expressions. It shines a light on how a rapidly evolving telecommunications system is influencing, and has future potential to influence, how we participate in society with resultant consequences for urban stocks and flows. In particular, the paper considers the integration of digital technologies into everyday life (digitalization) and their influence both spatially and temporally on our engagement in working, leisure and shopping. It also considers the phenomenon of collaborative consumption in cities (whereby sharing of goods and services, facilitated by digitalization, creates yet further dynamics for urban metabolism). The paper reveals the highly complex and evolving nature of digitalization and collaborative consumption and associated challenges in defining, measuring and understanding the dynamics of human behaviour and social and business practices. In response to this it also considers the underpinning driver of urban metabolism – fulfilment of society’s need or desire to access people, goods, services and opportunities. The paper outlines how different paths of urban development are now shaped by the inter-play between our land-use, transport and telecommunications systems and their use in terms of accessibility. Considerations for research and policymaking are highlighted which include the importance of addressing methodological issues in the face of a changing and uncertain future.",

Nowadays, the medical industry is affluent in data sources. These data sources are of use only if these are effectively analyzed on time. Methods: Data mining techniques are artificially intelligent and used to investigate known and unknown patterns available in the medical databases. Nowadays, data mining techniques are chronically used to mine abundant data sources of medical science. This paper explores the practice of diverse data mining techniques, the role of dataset used, effect of preprocessing, and the performances of different data mining techniques in diagnosis of different lifestyle based diseases. The venture of this paper is to fetch out stark assessments of different data mining techniques used in medical sciences. Results: By far, surveillance discloses that significant effort has been made for mining the data allied to the Cardiology and Diabetes. As per Google Scholar, in last seven years, the percentage of articles published related to cardio, diabetes, digestive, dentistry and ophthalmology disease diagnosis using data mining are 42%, 26%, 18%, 10% and 4% respectively. So, a little attention has been paid to develop predictive model for the diseases viz. ophthalmology, dentistry and digestive disorders. In addition, the rate of usage of preprocessing in diagnosis of different disorders related to cardio, diabetes, digestive, dentistry and ophthalmology lies between 10.65%–17.75%, 8.48%–14.80%, 4.58–8.93%, 2.96%–7.73% and 5.83%–12.93% respectively. Conclusion: An attention is obligatory to develop smart diagnostic system to aware and save human masses from wide critical spectrum of diseases related to ophthalmology, oral and digestive systems.",

Thus, it is possible that more agents are committed to monitor the same phenomenon in the same environment. Redundancy of sensors and agents is needed, for instance, in real world applications in order to mitigate the risk of faults and threats. One of the possible side effects produced by redundancy is that agents, observing the same phenomenon, could provide discordant opinions. Indeed, solid mechanisms for reaching an agreement among these agents and produce a shared consensus on the same observations are needed. This paper proposes an approach to integrate a fuzzy-based consensus model into a Situation Awareness framework. The main idea is to consider intelligent agents as experts claiming their opinions (preferences) on a phenomenon of interest.",

abstract = "Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.). These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information, whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However, it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment analysis and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation activities (accidents, vehicles, street conditions, traffic volume, etc.) and to make a city-feature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by using Protégé web ontology language (OWL) and Java, respectively. The experimental results show satisfactory improvement in tweet and review analysis and opinion mining.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition that affects approximately 70 million people worldwide. Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 30years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the recordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difficult to make in the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier.",

abstract = "In dynamic value networks (VNs), knowledge serves as a basis for close collaboration of actors (i.e. firms with their partners and customers) to enhance co-creation of integrated solutions. In order to provide a technical foundation for seamless knowledge transfer among actors, VNs require distributed and interoperable intra- and inter-organizational knowledge management systems (KMS), which rely largely on advanced information and communication technology (ICT). KMS cannot be seen as stand-alone information systems but should address a variety of issues (e.g. organizational or social issues) in relation to knowledge management. Therefore, the new generation of such complex systems, appropriate for VNs, must deal with this variety of issues, ranging from merely business-oriented to pure technologically-oriented issues. Although scholars have studied knowledge transfer and ICT issues in VN settings, their insights and results remain fragmented because of the diverse research efforts from different perspectives (either from a more business or a more technical perspective). This necessitates that a broader perspective needs to be established. This study endeavors to address simultaneously potential issues of both knowledge transfer and ICT in a VN by developing a comprehensive integrated framework. The development of the framework is based on a three-step methodology which comprises the exploration and classification of generic ICT issues in a VN setting, and subsequently integrating knowledge transfer issues with ICT issues. The proposed integrated framework provides a well-structured theoretical basis for future KMS requirement engineering in VN environments.",

It becomes the most attractive place for life and work for residents. At the same time, building an inviting place that meets the needs of city residents is a difficult task for local governments. Firstly to identify, and secondly to fulfil the citizens’ continuously changing needs. One of the easiest methods to help understand the residents’ needs can be crowdsourcing usage. However the most challenging area of responsibility is to manage traffic by the city logistics infrastructure designed to eliminate congestion problems within existing city spatial and, at the same time, to flexibly reply on transport changing demands. The answer to those challenges facilitating future Smart City logistics development is interoperable IT system usage based on cloud computing model. Similarly, cloud computing, by its design and characteristics, is particularly interesting for the public sector aiming to reduce costs and improve flexibility in operations. The cloud computing model gives unique opportunity to design city logistics infrastructure in the way that it is easily adaptive to changing transport demands. The main objective of the article is to present Smart City logistics on the cloud computing model (Cloud Smart City logistics) as the concept of citizens’ demand-driven flexible logistics infrastructure performance for the sustainable city of the future which is available for any city government interested in sustainable development.",

The nanocomposite PENG (nc-PENG) with high loading of BT NPs up to 40wt% in the nanocomposite can produce output voltage as high as 9.8V and output power density of 13.5µW/cm2 under cyclic bending, comparable to the output of conventional inorganic polycrystalline lead zirconate titanate PENGs. The high performance of these nc-PENGs is primarily attributed to the very high effective piezoelectricity of the highly crystalline P(VDF-TrFE), strengthened by the BT NPs. The nc-PENG was also demonstrated to harvest biomechanical energy from simple body movements and store the generated electricity during mechanical and biomechanical motions in a rechargeable microbattery.",

We further present reliability and availability measures for a susceptible SN from the perspective of reliability theory, from which we deduce and obtain metrics of reliability and availability assessment of HWSNs with star and cluster topologies. We therefore set up a dependability assessment mechanism for HWSNs with malware diffusion. Experiments illustrate the influence of the parameters on malware's selection of the optimal spread probability and the mean time to infection of a susceptible SN. We also validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. Our results can be applied to set up theoretical bases for governing the employment of reliable techniques.",

Significant advances are still necessary to enable the deployment of reliable industrial wireless networks capable to guarantee the strict QoS (Quality of Service) requirements of industrial applications in harsh propagation conditions. This paper contributes towards this objective with a novel multipath routing protocol that identifies and establishes the necessary redundant routes between any pair of nodes of a wireless network in order to satisfy the reliability and delay QoS levels demanded by industrial applications. The proposed protocol is here presented and analyzed under the framework of the WirelessHART standard given its important industrial adoption.

Ensemble algorithms are proposed to improve the classifier's accuracy. Moreover, a distance-based regional data set was generated to capture ozone transportation characteristics. The results show that a combination of preprocessing methods and ensemble algorithms can effectively forecast ozone threshold exceedances. Furthermore, this study advises on the relative importance of the different variables for ozone pollution prediction and confirms that regional data facilitate better forecasting.

Signifying more than simply the fair distribution of quantities of energy, energy justice also implies issues of procedural justice (participation) and recognition (acknowledgement of diverse values constitutive of ways of life). It is argued that this requires an acknowledgement of why energy use matters in everyday life. Data from the Energy Biographies project at Cardiff University is used to explore connections between the relational texture of everyday life and the ethical significance of energy. In particular, it is demonstrated that embodiment, attachment and narrative are features of sense-making that contribute significantly to everyday understandings of the ethical meanings of different ways of using energy. Using multimodal and biographical qualitative social science allows these implicit forms of evaluation to become more tangible, along with the relationships between them. Conceiving of energy consumers as subjects with biographies, with attachments, and as engaged bodily in energy consumption can open up, it is suggested, different ways of enacting the procedural and recognition aspects of energy justice.",

Within the degrowth movement, some approaches criticizing the western model of development suggest original criteria that could be integrated in the design process. The current study seeks to analyze the conviviality concept of Ivan Illich (1973) to develop a new framework for designers. To that end, current design literature and four industrial case studies were analyzed according to the five main threats to conviviality: the biological degradation of the ecosystem, radical monopoly, over-programming, polarization, and obsolescence. As a result, this paper proposes a framework that includes two guidelines: one for product scope and another for the socio-technical system scope. The guidelines are composed of a set of recommendations that emerge from the relationship between the threats to conviviality and life cycle stages of a product or service. These recommendations allow designers and engineers to better approach the complexity of the design process and co-create a strong sustainable society with stakeholders.",

Modern enterprises collect big data from various inbound and outbound data sources. The inbound data sources handle data generated from the results of business operations, such as manufacturing, supply chain management, marketing, and human resource management, among others. Outbound data sources handle customer-generated data which are acquired directly or indirectly from customers, market analysis, surveys, product reviews, and transactional histories. However, cloud service utilization costs increase because of big data analytics and value creation activities for enterprises and customers. This article presents a novel concept of big data reduction at the customer end in which early data reduction operations are performed to achieve multiple objectives, such as (a) lowering the service utilization cost, (b) enhancing the trust between customers and enterprises, (c) preserving privacy of customers, (d) enabling secure data sharing, and (e) delegating data sharing control to customers. We also propose a framework for early data reduction at customer end and present a business model for end-to-end data reduction in enterprise applications. The article further presents a business model canvas and maps the future application areas with its nine components. Finally, the article discusses the technology adoption challenges for value creation through big data reduction in enterprise applications.",

Within the public sector, smart city has become a popular term and municipal governments around the world are using multiple strategies to become smarter. However, there is no consensus about what smartness means and how to identify its key components or dimensions. Some definitions highlight information technology and data, while others pay attention to sustainability, openness, innovation, or resiliency. Based on a review of current literature, this paper identifies multiple dimensions of smartness and proposes an integrative view that highlights how each dimension contributes to the understanding and development of smart governments. We argue that smartness should be conceptualized in a broad and multifaceted way. The framework we present serves as a foundation to understand and measure smartness in government and provides guidelines for the comprehensive development of smart governments. Some of the dimensions have been identified and studied explicitly in the realm of smart government. A number of other dimensions are embedded in the literature as individual characteristics of a good government; although they are not explicitly referenced in relationship to smart government, we argue that they are important components of a government being smart. The paper also suggests that public managers do not control all dimensions equally. Some dimensions could be seen as relatively direct outputs of their actions, while others could be better understood as outcomes that could be affected, but not solely determined, by strategic interventions or deliberate actions.",

The WSN can be used in domains such as agriculture, energy, industrial automation, medical health care, smart building, and so on. In industry, the characteristics of the wireless channel are different in comparison to other WSN environments, such as home and office environments. The use of WSN in industry is subject to typical problems of wireless communications, such as noise, shadowing, multipath fading and interference. In addition, the wireless channel in many industrial environments is non-stationary for a long term, which can cause abrupt changes in the characteristics of the channel over time. A set of standards was developed for industrial WSN, to overcome these limitations, such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, WIA-PA, and IEEE 802.15.4e. All the mentioned standards are based on the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer, but define different mechanisms for the upper layers. However, according to recent publications, problems still can arise in the deployment of networks that follow the standards, because of multipath effects, and interference. This survey provides a structured overview of the standards used to implement industrial WSN, their advantages and drawbacks, and discusses the characteristics of the wireless channel in industrial environments. Finally, a systematic mapping is described, that presents results of publications about industrial WSN, and highlights important topics to be studied in this field.",

A number of policy instruments have been introduced to increase the efficiency of STI policies. One of them is S&T Foresight. The activities aimed at identification of national S&T priorities and series of Foresight studies have helped to understand which areas are most promising for sustaining existing competitive advantages and building new ones via gradual shift from the resource-based economy towards the technology-oriented one. The paper presents the design and organisation of a large-scale Russian S&T Foresight exercise as a fully-fledged instrument of the national STI policy and discusses the achieved results and their use for policies at different levels.",

abstract = "Background
Present day control and monitoring systems are equipped with a large number of heterogeneous devices and are operated by many users with different roles and responsibilities. The information generated by these devices, although preprocessed and filtered, is usually delivered to users regardless of their actual information needs, thus overwhelming cognitive capacities and potentially affecting safety of the system.
Objectives
This work aims to reduce information load to the users of the data-intensive monitoring systems by delivering selected information to each user based on his/her roles in the system and responsibilities.
Methods
The proposed approach combines Semantic Web (SW) technologies and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for configuration purposes and run-time analyzing. The approach is exemplified with implemented tools and feasibility study based on the performance tests. The paper describes principles of proposed approach, demonstrates illustrative scenarios from building automation domain, gives description of implemented tools, and presents results of the initial performance tests.
Results
The combination of SW and CEP brings two major advantages: (1) the behavior of the system could be easily changed by configuring only underlying ontology and (2) utilization of CEP at runtime makes system event-driven and reactive to frequent changes in the environment. The performance tests demonstrated the response time of implemented tools within one second for 1000 updates per second (which corresponded to 10,000 devices in the performed experiments).
Conclusions
It is expected that the proposed approach is able to make monitoring systems personal oriented and thus safer during the operation. The results of the performance tests suggest feasibility of the approach for such systems as building and home automation, and non-critical industrial automation.",

abstract = "It is believed that anomalous mental states such as stress and anxiety not only cause suffering for the individuals, but also lead to tragedies in some extreme cases. The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical way to predict an individual’s mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals’ mental states.",

abstract = "Availability is a major design issue that should play an important role when deploying and operating wireless sensor networks, specially for critical monitoring applications. Actually, sensing redundancy can be exploited to enhance the attainable availability level of sensor networks, since redundant nodes can replace faulty nodes. When employing camera-enabled sensors, the perception of sensing redundancy is considerably changed when compared to scalar sensors, with direct impact on network availability. In such way, some characteristics as deployment density, viewing angle and sensing range should be properly evaluated in wireless visual sensor networks, in order to better estimate the network availability. Nevertheless, when deploying visual sensors on occluded environments, viewed areas and resulted overlapping may be significantly altered, redefining sensing redundancy. We then propose an algorithm to automatically select redundant nodes in wireless visual sensor networks deployed on areas with occlusion, according to network configurations and application availability requirements. Additionally, an algorithm to adjust cameras’ orientations in occluded environments is also proposed. Mathematical assessment of the proposed algorithms are performed, allowing the discussion of how parameters of deployed networks can influence applications monitoring availability.",

abstract = "Context
As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine – Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain.
Objective
We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b) runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c) the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware.
Method
Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using appropriate experimentation.
Results
Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation selection.
Conclusion
The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be negligible depending on the domain.",

In the first phase, the energy-constrained relay harvests energy through radio-frequency signals from the primary source. In the second phase, the destinations decode the primary signal. The relay uses the harvested energy to forward the primary signal and the secondary signal in the third phase. We derive the close-form upper bound of the ergodic capacity of the primary system and propose a relay selection algorithm. In particular, we calculate the critical region to ensure that the ergodic capacity of the primary system is equal or larger than that of the direct system. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed schemes achieve a satisfying performance.",

Inspired by this, the purpose of this paper was to identify the forces shaping the smart city conception and, by doing so, to begin replacing the currently abstract image of what it means to be one. The paper commences by dividing the recent history of smart cities into two large sections – urban futures and the knowledge and innovation economy. The urban futures strand shows that technology has always played an important role in forward-looking visions about the city of the future. The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows that recent technological advancements have introduced a whole new level of knowledge management and innovation capabilities in the urban context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and demand pull for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances rapidly and creates a booming market of smart city products and solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of cities that seek to address the problems of efficiency and sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city product economy. The research route of this paper eventually allows the identification of the underlying – and often forgotten – principles of what it means to be ‘smart’ in an urban context and yields conclusions about strategic planning for the development of smart cities today.",

The ongoing innovation process of e-textiles holds opportunities to prevent future end-of-life impacts.

Three waste preventative eco-design approaches for e-textiles are discussed: 1 harnessing the inherent advantages of smart materials for sustainable design; 2 establishing open compatibility standards; 3 labelling the e-textiles to facilitate their recycling.

abstract = "In recent years, the significant advantages brought to business processes by process mining account for its evolution as a major concern in both industrial and academic research. In particular, increasing attention has been turned to compliance monitoring as a way to identify when a sequence of events deviates from the expected behaviour. As we are entering the IoT era, an increasing variety of smart objects can be introduced in business processes (e.g., tags to track products in a plant, smartphones and badge swiping to draw the activities of customers and employees in a shopping centre, etc.). All these objects produce large volumes of log data in the form of streams, which need to be run-time analysed to extract further knowledge about the underlying business process and to identify unexpected, non-conforming events. Albeit rather straightforward on a small log file, compliance verification techniques may show poor performances when dealing with big data and streams, thus calling for scalable approaches. This work investigates the possibility of spreading the compliance monitoring task over a network of computing nodes, achieving the desired scalability. The monitor is realised through the existing SCIFF framework for compliance checking, which provides a high level logic-based language for expressing the properties to be monitored and nicely supports the partitioning of the monitoring task. The distributed computation is achieved through a MapReduce approach and the adoption of an existing general engine for large scale stream processing. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach as well as the advantages in performance brought to the compliance monitoring task.",

A systematic approach for the semantic integration of relevant information is a key requirement to infer reliable monitoring states of the devices. Recent research explores how future industrial plants may use decentralized autonomous devices. To integrate such autonomous devices in a monitoring system, semantic models are required that describe the devices and their data, thus we need knowledge-based approaches. To date, the research on knowledge-based systems in the industrial domain has tended to focus on application-specific solutions rather than on generic solutions that integrate knowledge of multiple sources. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-engineering methodology to build a generic, reusable resource monitoring system for industrial plants which includes multiple knowledge sources. This approach can also be used to develop knowledge-based systems for other applications such as diagnostic or prognostic systems.",

abstract = "Cross-organizational business processes involve interactions offered as services which are orchestrated across multiple organizations. As in local intra-organizational processes, this type of processes also needs to handle exceptional situations, in order to become more flexible and automatically managed by business process management systems. Typically, exception handling is defined locally within the scope of an intra-organizational business process, using the appropriate business process modelling language constructs. However, these constructs do not foresee exceptions that occur in cross- organizational processes. In this paper we propose a WS-BPEL extension to define an interface between cross- organizational processes, in order to monitor the state of each interacting process and, consequently, define cross- organizational exception behaviour. We also present a prototype implementation of our proposed extensions by using a model transformation approach and an open-source business process engine.",

In this paper, a new approach for controlling the policy-based WSN application simulation is proposed by creating a Policy Integrated Development Environment (Policy IDE) to work interactively with the TOSSIM simulation software using a packet communication mechanism. The benefits of this approach are truly interactive simulation, granular unit testing, interactive debugging, execution trace to validate application logic, and a simplified debugging process for applications that involve policy programming.",

Qualitative data were collected with an organisational perspective from commercial food consumers along with large-scale food importers, distributors, and retailers. Cause-effect models are built and “what-if” simulations are conducted through the development and application of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approaches to elucidate dynamic interrelationships. The simulation models developed provide a practical insight into existing and emergent food losses scenarios, suggesting the need for big data sets to allow for generalizable findings to be extrapolated from a more detailed quantitative exercise. This research offers itself as evidence to support policy makers in the development of policies that facilitate interventions to reduce food losses. It also contributes to the literature through sustaining, impacting and potentially improving levels of food security, underpinned by empirically constructed policy models that identify potential behavioural changes. It is the extension of these simulation models set against a backdrop of a proposed big data framework for food security, where this study sets avenues for future research for others to design and construct big data research in food supply chains. This research has therefore sought to provide policymakers with a means to evaluate new and existing policies, whilst also offering a practical basis through which food chains can be made more resilient through the consideration of management practices and policy decisions.",

This raises questions regarding whether it is necessary to understand the theory behind the use of exposure.

An evaluation of current research on access control for smart spaces highlights that personalized context-based access control can provide better control over shared content. A local personal smart space access control framework is proposed focusing on the very nature of local personal smart space environments, namely, the enforcement of access control using personal preferences of users that are defined using policies.

Through hardware integration and software encapsulation, cloud asset could sense its real-time status, adapt to varied working scenarios, be controlled remotely, and shared among agencies. It enables accurate real-time control of every asset, and thus improves the management efficiency and effectiveness. This paper first presents the concept of cloud asset with its technical architecture, and then analyses the software agent model for cloud asset, which is the key enabler to realize UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of assets, and provides mobility and intelligence for them. After that, the framework of cloud asset-enabled workflow management is built, in which cloud asset could be easily found and dynamically invoked by different workflows. Finally, a demonstrative case is provided to verify the effectiveness of cloud asset.",

Based on incomplete contracting theory, we analyze the influence of various factors on these control structures in venture capital models, from the perspectives of investors, entrepreneurs, and startups. In particular, we show how factors such as bargaining power, monitoring costs, private benefits, and risk aversion impact the allocation of control rights. Using the survey data on a heterogeneous group of venture capital-backed startups in China, we empirically examine the impacts of various factors on the control structures of these enterprises. Based on the full sample of enterprises, we find that the stronger the venture capitalist’s bargaining power and the higher the monitoring costs, the more likely investors and entrepreneurs are to prefer joint control. Further, the greater the entrepreneur’s financing need and private benefits, the more likely investors and entrepreneurs are to choose joint control. High-tech startups are more likely to choose a joint control model than those in traditional industries. This is especially true for high-tech startups at an early stage of development. In addition, for high-tech startups, the probability of choosing joint control shows a negative relationship with investors’ strategic benefits and a positive relationship with investors’ risk aversion. Regarding startups in traditional industries, investors’ strategic benefits and risk aversion have an insignificant impact on their control structures.",

An important trend in the automotive domain is to adapt established functional safety processes and methods for security engi- neering. Although functional safety and cyber-security engineering have a considerable overlap, the trend of adapting methods from one domain to the other is often challenged by non-domain experts. Just as safety became a critical part of the development in the late 20th century, modern vehicles are now required to become resilient against cyber-attacks. As vehicle providers gear up for this challenge, they can capitalize on experiences from many other domains, but must also face several unique challenges. Such as, that cyber-security engineering will now join reliability and safety as a cornerstone for success in the automotive industry and approaches need to be integrated into the mainly safety oriented development lifecycle of the domain. The recently released SAE J3061 guidebook for cyber-physical vehicle systems focus on designing cyber-security aware systems in close relation to the automotive safety standard ISO 26262. The key contribution of this paper is to analyse a method to identify attack vectors on complex automotive systems via signal interfaces and propose a security classification scheme and protection mechanisms on signal layer. To that aim, the hardware- software interface (HSI), a central development artefact of the ISO 26262 functional safety development process, is used and extended to support the cyber-security engineering process and provide cyber-security countermeasures on signal layer.",

A large body of literature reported on specific uses of the important data mining paradigm in accounting, but research that takes a holistic view of these uses is lacking. To organize the literature on the applications of data mining in accounting, we create a framework that combines the two well-known accounting reporting perspectives (retrospection and prospection), and the three well-accepted goals of data mining (description, prediction, and prescription). The framework encapsulates a taxonomy of four categories (retrospective-descriptive, retrospective-prescriptive, prospective-prescriptive, and prospective-predictive) of data mining applications in accounting. The proposed framework revealed that the area of accounting that benefited the most from data mining is assurance and compliance, including fraud detection, business health and forensic accounting. The clear gaps seem to be in the two prescriptive application categories (retrospective-prescriptive and prospective-prescriptive), indicating opportunities for benefiting from data mining in these application categories. The framework presents a holistic view of the literature and systematically organizes it in a structurally logical and thematically coherent manner.",

However, while significant efforts have been made towards CPS application in several other industry sectors, the exploration of CPS benefits and applicability to the construction industry is at the initial stage. While CPS has been identified as a promising solution to address problems in the construction industry, few explorations have been made on CPS application to temporary structures, which have significant safety issues that urgently need to be addressed. With a focus on the enhanced monitoring of temporary structures to prevent potential structural failures, this study proposed a CPS-based temporary structures monitoring (TSM) system that integrates the virtual model of a temporary structure and the physical structure on the construction jobsite. In doing this, the applicability of CPS to temporary structures monitoring is investigated, and end user requirements and system requirements are identified for system design. In addition, a system architecture and a description of the issues surrounding the choice of a system development environment are presented. For better understanding of how the TSM works, aspects of the developed CPS-based TSM are presented with system workflow and simulated examples of the structural monitoring of a scaffolding system. The potential benefits and barriers to CPS implementation in temporary structures, along with future research based on this study, are highlighted.",

abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "Supply chain product visibility may be defined to mean the capacity of the supply chain to have a view of a product’s lifecycle, from its conception, manufacturing, distribution, delivery to the end customer, customer’s experience of the product, and the product’s end-of-life activities and processes. This implies developing and keeping a record of the product’s materials and components, its physical state throughout the supply chain, the product’s forward movement to the user-customer, customer’s experience of the product, and the reverse logistics and reuse or termination of the product. The aim of visibility is to foster planning, control and agility of operations associated with the product and to improve customer experience of the product. “Tracking” is the term often used to describe the determination of the identity and state of a product in the forward direction (from manufacturing to the end user), while “tracing” is used to infer the product’s path and history from downstream to upstream of the supply chain. In recent times there has been an upsurge of academic and commercial interest in product visibility. This interest has translated into numerous architectures, technologies and software for product visibility, both at the atomic (item) and composite (or aggregate) levels. Based on an extensive content analysis of academic and trade literature, including websites and documents of vendors and users of the technologies, this paper captures, analyses, compares and contrasts the design choices, essence, results and current and potential future impacts of some of the recent developments. The study also used survey by questionnaire across industries to assess user requirements of tracking and tracing systems and structures. The paper also charts future research directions for end-to-end visibility of product classes and their instances in supply chains.",

These include inequality, poverty, corruption and migration, as well as climate change, loss of habitat and the ageing society. A conceptual framework for open governance systems enabled by ICT is proposed, drawing on evidence and examples from around the world as well as a critical appraisal of both academic and grey literature. The framework constructs a system of open assets, open services and open engagement, and this is used to move the e-government debate forward from a preoccupation with lean and small governments which ‘do more with less’ to examine the potential for open governance systems to also ‘do more with more’. This is achieved by enabling an open government and open public sector, as part of this open governance system, to ‘do more by leveraging more’ of the existing assets and resources across the whole of society, and not just within the public sector, many of which are unrealised and untapped, so in effect are ‘wasted’. The paper argues that efficiencies and productivity improvements are essential at all levels and across all actors, as is maximising both public and private value, but that they must also be seen at the societal level where trade-offs and interactions are required, and not only at the individual actor level.",

The UHF RFID chip SL900A, which includes an on-chip temperature sensor, is used on both tags to drive the relative humidity (RH) sensors and the RF communication. These tags have been fabricated on polyimide substrate (Kapton HN) which presents a well known humidity dependence. Printed RH sensors consist of an array of 12 serpentine electrodes fabricated by inkjet printing and an array of 6 screen printed interdigitated electrodes, respectively, to achieve a capacitance of around 35pF far from the capacitive parasites present in the structure. Both tags are able to provide temperature and relative humidity environmental parameters in digital form answering to the inquiries of a RFID reader in a passive energy mode (without batteries). With very low thermal drifts, below 0.05%RH/°C, a RH range of 30% is covered by both tag with sensitivities of 100fF/RH% for the inkjetted serpentine structure and 54fF/RH% for the screen-printed one. Therefore, we propose passive RFID tags with a single silicon chip providing a cost-effective solution to monitor environmental conditions based on printing technologies.",

Their goal is to improve teaching and learning using innovative technology in institutions of learning. This has brought about the formulation of educational ICT policies. These policies are aimed at guiding the implementation processes in schools. Namibia adopted the National ICT policy for Education in 2005 and the National ICT Policy Implementation Plan in 2006. Based on information, since the adoption of the policy, no study has been done to evaluate the implementation process, thereby making it difficult to ascertain the readiness of teachers and learners towards the adoption of these technologies of which mobile learning technology is one of them. This study analyses the perception of teachers and learners towards the adoption of mobile learning in Namibian high schools. The research is a mixed method study, undertaking surveys and interviews with learners and teachers from three schools in the Khomas region. The study uses the UTAUT as a guiding model to analyse teacher and learner perceptions towards mobile learning. Data collected after survey were analyzed using SPSS and excel tools, and then percentage analysis was done to find the key contributors towards to adoption of mobile learning in Namibian high schools. The findings were that the majority of teachers and learners in Namibian high schools are mobile ICT literate. Most of teachers and learners own handheld mobile devices, can access the internet, download education material and applications from the internet using mobile devices, use mobile devices as calculators, access social networking sites, search for definitions of words on mobile, send emails, conduct searches for material, read assignments and post comments on blogs. Both teachers and learners were positive that mobile technology would enhance their teaching and learning capabilities, assist in improving learner grades and accomplish teaching and learning activities quickly. Although learners were positive that mobile education should be made compulsory in schools, they feel that the decision lies with policy makers on whether schools should adopt it. Both learners and teachers feel that Namibia has the resources in place to introduce mobile learning without any glitches. These resources are in the form of infrastructure and human resources.",

We will show that it is a very cost-effective way to build refuges, and viable solutions exist for various budgets and timeframes. Nuclear submarines are surface independent, and could provide energy, oxygen, fresh water and perhaps even food for their inhabitants for years. They are able to withstand close nuclear explosions and radiation. They are able to maintain isolation from biological attacks and most known weapons. They already exist and need only small adaptation to be used as refuges. But building refuges is only “Plan B” of existential risk preparation; it is better to eliminate such risks than try to survive them.",

abstract = "In this paper, we present a very fast and simple protocol for polling tags in an RFID system formed by one or more readers, and a multitude of tags. Actually, the protocol is time-optimal for single reader systems, while being very fast for multiple readers systems. The main idea of the protocol described in this paper, is to associate a short and unique number (called “nickname” in the following) to each tag in the reader’s range, and by using such nicknames as the polling order. We first describe the single reader version of the protocol. For this version, the used nicknames are the integers 1,2,…,n if the set of tags to be polled is formed by n tags. They can be seen as the time slot in which a tag has to communicate with the reader. We also provide a procedure to assign a nickname for a new tag, as well as a way to delete a tag from the polling order, while keeping the above consecutivity property about nicknames. When polled, the tags transmit a proper (usually short) message. Polling protocols, sometime with little changes, sometime with no change, can be efficiently used for solving several practical problems related to the use of RFID systems. Some of the most prominent ones, and those considered in this paper, are the problems of exactly determine missing tags, the collection of information associated to the tags, the probabilistic determination of missing tags (useful for raising a warning), and the determination of the presence of cloned tags, again for raising a proper warning. We formally show that the protocol is time-optimal. Besides, the protocol is privacy preserving since tags ID’s are never transmitted during the polling procedure. In the protocol version for large, multireader RFID systems, we take an approach completely different from that used so far for any multireader protocol. Up to now, in the proposed protocols for this and related problems, first readers are scheduled so that those with overlapping ranges never operate at the same time. Then, single reader protocol for each so scheduled reader are applied. Here, we schedule the tags instead of the readers so that tags whose transmission can be received by a common reader, never operate at the same time. Then, we show that our polling protocol for single reader systems can be effectively used along with such a tags scheduling strategy, in multireader systems. The time performance improvement of our protocol over the known ones for multireader systems is very large, going from two to seven times, as shown by a simulation experiment we set up, and whose results are also presented.",

However, the layout of LEDs will lead to the uneven distribution of the received optical power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the same receiving plane, which cannot guarantee fairness of communication. To solve this problem, we used an LED source array and introduced a power adjustment factor to determine a set of optimal power regulators to improve the power distribution on the same receiving plane. We proposed an improved cuckoo search (ICS) algorithm based on chaos theory and dimension cells to solve the normal CS algorithm convergence problem. The chaos mechanism will optimize the random distribution of the initial solution for chaotic distribution, and it can achieve an improved quality of the initial solutions. Moreover, we divided the multidimensional solutions into several dimension cells to avoid interference between dimensions. Simulation results show that the accuracy and the convergence rate of the ICS algorithm is better than that of CS, particle swarm optimization, and evolutionary algorithm. Furthermore, the fairness of the received optical power and SNR on the same receiving plane can be clearly improved.",

abstract = "Ports globally face considerable challenges ranging from efficiency in operations to security threats. These call for research on innovative solutions with minimal reliance on manual interventions and controls. This paper discusses the design and operation of an intelligent model of a port. The model is designed based on the challenges, experiences and operations of the port of Mombasa. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is central to the model in enabling intelligence. The embedded intelligence includes: what is entering or has entered the port; what is in the port; what is leaving or has left the port; legal (authorized) and illegal (un-authorized) transactions and movements; and, health and risk status of the cargo. Remedial measures are instituted upon observation of violations or deviations together with alert generation on violations or whenever set thresholds are exceeded that are then sent to relevant persons or agencies as defined in the system. The basis of the intelligent model, design, working operations and supporting technologies are presented. Simulations of the model are undertaken for movement of goods from arrival at the port to release using four simulations. Details of the simulation design and results are presented. An evaluation of the model and how it addresses the challenges currently being experienced are provided. Finally, the benefits of implementation, limitations and likely direction of the future are enumerated.",

Standardization bodies such as the ISO/IEC and the IEEE are developing new specifications or updating their existing ones to reflect this interest. During this process, collaborations that span throughout several standardization documents and bodies have emerged in order to avoid the duplication of efforts and to speed up the standardization process. In the ever complex standardization world, this interconnection of standards makes the current status of the process difficult to understand, specially when most of the documents are still in development and constantly being updated. In this paper, we aim to provide a clearer view of the state of the sensor and RFID integration standardization activities, highlighting the collaboration among standardization bodies and discussing how these standardization processes are likely to evolve.",

SIRS epidemic model is analogically introduced by measuring transition velocity of all the entities in the technology diffusion system respectively. We implement the model deterministically to forecast the potential of industrial and technological disruption in the short run, and stochastically to forecast the disruptive technology's major outbreak in candidate application areas in the long run. Radio-frequency identification technology is selected as case study. We conclude by discussing the major outbreak probabilities and potential disruptions of RFID in three different application areas.

Next, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and analytic hierarchy process were applied to the STA evaluation of Hongshan Zoo, a popular tourist attraction in China. Then, importance-performance analysis was conducted to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of Hongshan Zoo's STA construction. Findings suggest that “smart information system”, “intelligent tourism management”, “smart sightseeing”, “e-commerce system”, “smart safety”, “intelligent traffic”, “smart forecasting” and “virtual tourist attractions” are tourists' key evaluation factors of STA.

We then examine data availability, information processing systems and accreditation protocols that would be required to support a market-wide application of PEF. Findings highlight an opportunity to influence the behaviour of the larger market segment of conventional (non-organic) consumers. Further research is required into the interaction between PEF and organics, PEF and origin, marketing and branding of the label, for market wide applications to be considered. A key question emerges as to whether PEF requires a different application platform than a voluntary eco-label scheme to instigate behavioural change.",

It is a challenge to provide the required QoI in mobile sensor networks given the large scale and complexity of the networks with heterogeneous mobile and sensing devices. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study on major QoI metrics for mobile sensor networks and discuss how QoI-aware data collection can be achieved. The cases with mobile sensors, mobile sinks, and mobile mules carrying data and their impact on QoI are discussed in detail. Mobility creates challenges in terms of timeliness but also opportunities in increased coverage and relevance. In a case study, we design a QoI-aware publish/subscribe system for mobile sensor networks. Users can subscribe to obtain information about events of interest by specifying the target area, sensing context, etc. The subscriptions and the sensing data are delivered to relevant sensors and users by location-based routing. We also discuss techniques that can be applied to further enhance the QoI in our publish/subscribe system. Simulation results demonstrate that the users can receive their subscribed data successfully with low communication overhead. Our publish/subscribe system can also handle mobility of clients smoothly without causing any data loss.",

The evaluation space contains the performance parameters or evaluation criteria, which indicate the design‘s ability to satisfy the functional and aesthetic requirements, such us passive solar gain control or visual comfort. All the design parameters and evaluation criteria are explained in detail in the paper.

A list of noted journals and search results from Science Direct and Web of Knowledge, IEEE Xplore, and INFORMS (approximately 11,000 journal articles) is used to prepare content collection. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is applied as the review and knowledge extraction methodology. Using the text analysis and mining method we can combine statistical methods and expert human judgment to extract knowledge in the form of key latent factors. The LSA based analysis gives the study a scientific grounding which helps to overcome the subjectivity of collective opinion about the trends. This approach allows proposing taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. The adopted systems approach is used to find research gaps in each class of taxonomy. An emerging trend is noticed in the research of behavioral operations in supply chain. Understanding such a scholarly structure and future trends will assist researchers to assimilate the divergent developments of this multidisciplinary research in one place. This review will be beneficial for practitioners as they consider behavioral aspects in decision making. We have also studied articles related to supply chain published in Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA) journal. We have speculated what an ESWA-related community would like to see in future publications. This will encourage researchers to explore the recommended areas and publish to these outlets.",

Telecare medicine information system (TMIS) is a widely used application nowadays. Through the services provided by such e-health systems, doctors can obtain the variation of patients’ conditions and make treatments quickly and accordingly. Recently, researchers have employed the Chebyshev chaotic maps in the authentication process of TMISs. Unfortunately, many kinds of security weaknesses such as off-line guessing attack, destitution of user anonymity and session key agreement happen in relative work. To overcome the disadvantages, we propose a secure remote authentication scheme employing the chaotic maps. We use the formal proof under random oracle model, and the famous verification tool Proverif to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Besides, informal analysis including ten security properties and performance comparison are shown to supplement the security properties. From the formal proof, we can see that the attacker has a negligible probability to crack the scheme over the active guessing attack. The formal verification demonstrates that our scheme can resist the attackers simulated by the tool Proverif. Moreover, we compare our scheme with several recent schemes, and the comparison results show that our scheme reaches the level of security requirements and also has suitable cost in performance. Thus, it is more applicable to telecare medicineenvironments.",

In order to guide the design of such protocols, we introduce co-utility as a framework for cooperation between rational agents such that the best strategy for each agent is to help another agent achieve her best outcome. Specifically, in this work we study and characterize self-enforcing protocols in game-theoretic terms. Then, we use this characterization to develop the concept of co-utile protocol and study under which circumstances co-utility arises. Furthermore, we give a detailed study of co-utile protocol design in the case of anonymous query submission to a web search engine. The theoretical analysis is complemented with empirical results obtained from an implementation in a simulated multi-agent environment, which illustrates how co-utility can make cooperation self-enforcing and improve the agents' welfare.",

For information systems (IS) the domain of semiosis consists of human and non-human interactions based on technologically-mediated communication in the social, material and personal worlds. The paper argues that semiosis has immense bearing on processes of communication central to the advanced information and communications technologies studied by IS scholars. Its use separately, or in mixed methods approaches, enriches areas of central concern to the IS field, and is particularly apt when researching internet-based development and applications, for example virtual worlds and social media. This paper presents a four step structured methodology, informed by a central theoretical semiotic framework to provide practical guidelines for operationalizing semiotics in IS research. Thus, using illustrative examples, the paper provides a step-by-step semiotics approach to research based on distinctive semiotic concepts and their relationships – producer, consumer, medium, code, message and content – and how, at an integrating level, the personal, social and material worlds relate through sociation, embodiment and socio-materiality.",

This paper presents a prototype based on the case of Catania with the aim of sharing the lessons learnt, which can be reused as reference practices in other cases with similar requirements. The importance of achieving syntactic as well as semantic interoperability – as a result of transforming heterogeneous sources into Linked Data – is discussed: semantic interoperability is solved at data level in order to ease further development on top. We present a comprehensive data model for smart cities that integrates several data sources, including, geo-referenced data, public transportation, urban fault reporting, road maintenance and municipal waste collection. We show some novel ontology design patterns for modeling public transportation, urban fault reporting and road maintenance. Domain practitioners and general members of the public have been asked to play with the prototype, and fill out a survey with questions and feedbacks. A computational experiment has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of our data model in terms of practical scalability over increasing data and efficiency under complex queries. All produced data, models, prototype and questionnaire results are publicly accessible online.",

abstract = "Increased electricity consumption and environmental impacts of Information Communication Technology (ICT) have been subjects of research since the 1990s. This paper focuses on consumer electronics in households, in particular TVs, computers and their peripherals. ICT accounts for almost 15% of global domestic electricity use, including waste energy from devices left on standby which is estimated in the EU-27 to contribute 6% of residential energy demand. In Europe, the household electricity consumption from small electronic appliances, including ICT, increased by 2.5 times in 2011 compared to 1990. Similarly, in the UK, energy demand from electronic devices accounted for 23% of total household electricity use in 2012, compared to 12% in 1990. This is an outcome of the market saturation of new, cheaper ICT entertainment devices, facilitated by marketing strategies which identify new needs for consumers, as charted by the review of market growth in this paper. New increasingly portable laptops, smart phones and tablets with wireless connectivity allow householders to perform a wider range of activities in a wider range of locations throughout the home, such as social networking while the television is active. We suggest that policies which consider how to increase the energy efficiency of ICT devices alone are unlikely to be successful since effective strategies need to address how the drivers which have developed around the use of ICT can be adapted in order to conserve electricity in households. A range of policy solutions are discussed, including feedback, public information campaigns, environmental education, energy labelling, bans of, or taxation on the least efficient products as well as the use of a TV as central hub to perform the existing functions of multiple devices.",

This paper investigates how different types of control were envisioned and designed for a two-year smart grid trial in Denmark with 20 private households. Using the notion of script, processes of in- and de-scription were used to gain insights into perceived and enacted control. Based on empirical data from 26 interviews and three workshops, we show how the in-scription process of control can be characterized as dynamic and includes negotiations between the residents and those responsible for the project. Second, we show how users de-script control, and third, we outline the project owners’ reaction to the user’s de-scription of control. The design of the remote control appears to have promoted a preference for ‘passive consumers' within a smart grid. This design prompts questions about how the users in smart grid development are envisioned and configured using different ideas about control. With current development and the need for additional energy reductions, consumers who invest in photovoltaic solar cells and electric vehicles lose interest in delivering their energy to the system level.",

There are various ways of using different sensors for human activity recognition in a smartly controlled environment. Among which, physical human activity recognition through wearable sensors provides valuable information about an individual’s degree of functional ability and lifestyle. In this paper, we present a smartphone inertial sensors-based approach for human activity recognition. Efficient features are first extracted from raw data. The features include mean, median, autoregressive coefficients, etc. The features are further processed by a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to make them more robust.

The proposed approach was compared with traditional expression recognition approaches such as typical multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where it outperformed them.",

Traditional fabrication techniques have limitations in controlling the geometry and architecture of the electrode and solid-state electrolytes, which would otherwise compromise the performance. 3D printing, a disruptive manufacturing technology, has emerged as an innovative approach to fabricating EES devices from nanoscale to macroscale, providing great opportunities to accurately control device geometry (e.g., dimension, porosity, and morphology) and structure with enhanced specific energy and power densities. Moreover, the “additive” manufacturing nature of 3D printing provides excellent controllability of the electrode thickness with much simplified process in a cost effective manner. With the unique spatial and temporal material manipulation capability, 3D printing can integrate multiple nano-materials in the same print, and multi-functional EES devices (including functional gradient devices) can be fabricated. Herein, we review recent advances in 3D printing of EES devices. We focus on two major 3D printing technologies including direct writing and inkjet printing. The direct material deposition characteristics of these two processes enable them to print on a variety of flat substrates, even a conformal one, well suiting them to applications such as wearable devices and on-chip integrations. Other potential 3D printing techniques such as freeze nano-printing, stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, binder jetting, laminated object manufacturing, and metal 3D printing are also introduced. The advantages and limitations of each 3D printing technology are extensively discussed. More importantly, we provide a perspective on how to integrate the emerging 3D printing with existing technologies to create structures over multiple length scale from nano to macro for EES applications.",

Our study focuses on the problem of partial coverage, targeting scenarios in which the continuous monitoring of a limited portion of the area of interest is enough. In this paper we present PCLA, a novel algorithm that relies on Learning Automata to implement sleep scheduling approaches. It aims at minimizing the number of sensors to activate for covering a desired portion of the region of interest preserving the connectivity among sensors. Simulation results show how PCLA can select sensors in an efficient way to satisfy the imposed constraints, thus guaranteeing good performance in terms of time complexity, working-node ratio, scalability, and WSN lifetime. Moreover, compared to the state of the art, PCLA is able to guarantee better performance.",

The categories of the existing PMSs are identified from the latest literature, and a brief study of each type is conducted. Then, the MPC approach is introduced and its advantages are discussed. Based on the acquisition method of driver behavior used for state prediction and the dynamic model used, the MPC is classified and elaborated. Factors that affect the performance of the MPC are put forward, including prediction accuracy, design parameters, and solvers. Finally, several important issues in the application of MPC-based power management strategies and latest developing trends are discussed.

Four different geometries of transducer have been evaluated by two different measurement techniques. Devices were fabricated by etching planar gold electrodes on low-cost glass-fibre substrates (FR-4) using a standard printed circuit board (PCB) photolithography, wet etching and electroless plating method. Thin films of the P-type semiconducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT-PSS, were cast onto the electrodes by spin-coating. The conducting polymer films were electrically characterised by measuring the film resistance from the underlying gold electrodes using a digital multimeter, and also by determination of the film's current–voltage transfer characteristic (I–V curve) measured with a precision laboratory 4-point probe instrument. This allowed the relative contribution of the contact resistance at the Au/PEDOT-PSS interface to be determined as a proportion of the overall measured resistance. Contact resistance is known to affect the analytical performance of chemiresistor type devices, so in this work the combined effects of electrode geometry, polymer film composition and ageing of the film on bulk film and contact resistances have been investigated. The applicability of the chemiresistor transducers for chemical sensing is demonstrated using a PEDOT-PSS thin film as an ethanol vapour sensitive coating in a simple vapour exposure test, where a reversible conductometric response was observed. Due to the simplicity, low-cost and ultra low-power requirements of these transducers, they may be particularly suited to battery powered mobile and wireless sensing applications, or to applications dependant upon energy harvesting.",

SAI features, such as direct connection with intellectual skills, the ability to understand, learn and make autonomous decisions may cause situations where autonomous systems based on AI will make decisions which will be in the best interests of individuals, even though conflicting with the user's own will. To consider the possibility of SAI being recognized as possessing legal personality, we analyse the concept and features of SAI and define its operating principles. We give hypothetical examples to demonstrate the necessity of SAIs being recognized as such. The paper undertakes legal personality analysis of SAI performed: (i) using the philosophical and legal concepts of a subject (person); (ii) discussing artificial (unnatural subjects of law) as an alternative to the recognition of legal personality of SAI; (iii) using elements of legal personality set for natural and legal persons. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the scope of SAI rights and obligations will not necessarily be the same as the scope of rights and obligations of other subjects of law. Thus, SAI could only have rights and obligations that are strictly defined by legislators. This conclusion suggests that the result of this paper may be its use in further research defining the scope of SAI rights and obligations.",

abstract = "Context
Ambient Intelligence systems domain is an outstanding example of modern systems that are in permanent evolution, as new devices, technologies or facilities are continuously appearing. This means it would be desirable to have a mechanism that helps with the propagation of evolution changes in deployed systems.
Objective
We present a software product line engineering process to manage the evolution of FamiWare, a family of middleware for ambient intelligence environments. This process drives the evolution of FamiWare middleware configurations using cardinality-based feature models, which are especially well suited to express the structural variability of ambient intelligence systems.
Method
FamiWare uses cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model the structural variability present in ambient intelligence systems, composed of a large variety of heterogeneous devices. Since the management evolution of configurations with clonable features is manually untreatable due to the high number of features, our process automates it and propagates changes made at feature level to the architectural components of the FamiWare middleware. This is a model driven development process as the evolution management, the propagation of evolution changes and the code generation are performed using some kind of model mappings and transformations. Concretely we present a variability modelling language to map the selection of features to the corresponding FamiWare middleware architectural components.
Results
Our process is able to manage the evolution of cardinality-based feature models with thousands of features, something which is not possible to tackle manually. Thanks to the use of the variability language and the automatic code generation it is possible to propagate and maintain a correspondence between the FamiWare architectural model and the code. The process is then able to calculate the architectural differences between the evolved configuration and the previous one. Checking these differences, our process helps to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To perform those tasks we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two feature model configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one.
Conclusion
Our process automatically propagates the evolution changes of the middleware family into the existing configurations where the middleware is already deployed and also helps us to calculate the effort in performing the changes in every configuration. Finally, we validated our approach, demonstrating the functioning of the defined operators and showing that by using our tool we can generate evolved configurations for FamiWare with thousands of cloned features, for several case studies.",

Empirically, it aims to explore sectoral futures at European level in a range of different sectors (automotive, construction, textile, KIBS, wholesale & retail), to identify cross-cutting patterns of sectoral change, and to highlight implications that these may raise for European innovation policy. In order to do this in a systematic manner, it also has a conceptual and methodological ambition, namely to devise a sectoral innovation foresight methodology that builds explicitly on concepts derived from sectoral innovation systems approaches. This theory-led methodology allows exploring and interpreting future developments at sectoral level in a coherent and comparable manner. Technologies and knowledge, actors and organisations, user needs and demand, as well as institutional and policy frameworks are taken into account; elements that need to co-evolve for any innovation system scenario to unfold. This conceptual framework is translated into a sector innovation foresight methodology that was used to guide a multi-sector foresight initiative. Based on a meta-analysis of insights from five different sectors, cross-sectoral patterns of future change as well as cross-cutting policy issues are pointed out. Three areas of cross-cutting changes have been identified: a) the shift from products to systems and services, b) blurring boundaries between sectors, and c) sectoral and cross-sectoral integration of sustainability demands, and the governance of interactions between sectors. Foresight projects at sectoral level have been conducted rarely as compared to technology-centered or societal-issue centered foresights or retrospective sectoral innovation system studies. By relying explicitly on a theoretical framework of sectoral innovation systems, this paper explores the potential of better linking innovation theory to policy- and strategy-oriented foresight.",

abstract = "Agriculture is the backbone of our economic system and plays an important role in the life of an economy. It does not only provide raw material and food, but also provides large employment opportunities. Therefore, agriculture requires modern technology for increasing the productivity. In this context, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) could be utilized for monitoring the climatic parameters such as (temperature, humidity, light, carbon dioxide, soil moisture, acidity etc.) in an agriculture field. The climatic parameters are very important in terms of growth, quality and productivity of crops. But, any kind of interception, modification, insertion, and deletion on these parameters can have negative effect on crop. Therefore, security and privacy are important issues in agriculture field. In this regard, we design a novel remote user authentication scheme using wireless sensor networks for agriculture monitoring. The protocol is validated through Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and also simulated using Automated Validation Information Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. We formally analyze the security of the scheme using random oracle model. In addition, the informal security analysis shows that the proposed protocol is secure and resists various kinds of malicious attacks. As a results, the proposed protocol is applicable in a real life application.",

abstract = "Context: Software product lines (SPL) engineering defines a set of systems that share common features and artifacts to achieve high productivity, quality, market agility, low time to market, and cost. An SPL product is derived from a configuration of features which need to be compounded together without violating their particular specifications. While it is easy to identify the behavior of a feature in isolation, specifying and resolving interactions among features may not be a straightforward task. The feature interaction problem has been a challenging subject for decades. Objective: This study aims at surveying existing research on feature interaction in SPL engineering in order to identify common practices and research trends. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of seven research questions, in which the 35 studies found are mainly classified regarding the feature interaction solution presented: detection, resolution and general analysis. Results: 43% of the papers deal with feature interaction at early phases of a software lifecycle. The remaining is shared among the other categories: source code detection, resolution and analysis. For each category, it was also identified the main strategies used to deal with interactions. Conclusions: The findings can help to understand the needs in feature interaction for SPL engineering, and highlight aspects that still demand an additional investigation. For example, often strategies are partial and only address specific points of a feature interaction investigation.",

Several of the limitations involve routing and reliability, and one of the key challenges is localization without the aid of global positioning services. On the one hand, GPS tends to be efficiently used only in open areas, and on the other hand, if integrated, the hardware overhead cost could be increased and there could be a smaller the battery lifetime. Thus, with the distance estimation derived from the received signal strength, a range-free localization scheme is promising as a cost-effective approach in which one of the optimization approaches is based on soft computing (which is typically used to address uncertainty and approximation) to achieve practicability and robustness. Thus, this research investigates probable soft computing techniques that are comparatively applied to localizations in a variety of components and subsequently proposes an alternative scheme that utilizes an extreme learning machine to increase the estimation accuracy. To enhance its precision further with a time complexity trade-off, a greedy-based approach that combines modified mass–spring optimizations is integrated and then evaluated by the simulation; these techniques demonstrate effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art soft-computing-based range-free localization schemes.",

ITU-T G.9903 standard for power line communication specifies LOADng as its default routing protocol. LOADng establishes bidirectional routes and has routing mechanisms for unicast, multicast and broadcast packets. This paper discusses a general framework for the IPv6 based implementation of a reactive routing protocol in ns-3. The framework is then used to implement LOADng routing protocol in ns-3 as per the latest Internet-draft recommendation. Our implementation of LOADng module in ns-3 is useful to study the potentials and pitfalls of the protocol, to investigate the impact of the various protocol parameters, to derive some non-trivial insights into the protocol behavior, and to compare its performance with other routing protocols proposed for LLNs. Our implementation is flexible enough to be modified and augmented with new features. To reduce the control overhead, the Smart-RREQ concept is incorporated as an extension to the basic framework. Another important feature added to this basic module is the multipath capability. Performance improvements with these new features are verified. The module is also tested for its performance with different route metrics. The framework is useful for implementation of other reactive routing protocols in ns-3.",

As to the long-term endemic situation, we have proved the existence and uniqueness of a steady state. We check the accuracy of the model by means of Monte Carlo simulations. To improve the level of accuracy, we propose a slight modification of the mean-field equations which changes the way we compute the probability for a node of acquiring the infection from one of its neighbors. As a consequence, correlations between probabilities of different states are implicitly incorporated into the model giving improved predictions and being very close to simulation-based data.",

Service productions and consumptions take different forms across these service types.

This multifaceted nature of the next generation Internet raises policy issues regarding network investment and net neutrality. This study aims at developing a dynamic model with a representative user whose preferences are differentiated by service types. The fraction of usage of social connections and the level of the extra capital stock are state variables representing system behavior. My analyses identify not only interior but also boundary equilibria under various scenarios about the relationships between the relative productivity and cost of social connectedness and premium network services. The policy implications from the analysis include the effects of rapid technological development on network obsolescence, which may tip the market in favor of social connections.

The low power consumption and the high versatility of the power management unit allow its implementation within single- and multi-source power management circuits for piezoelectric converters. Experimental results show that the proposed single-source power management circuit is able to extract energy from a piezoelectric converter excited by sinusoidal vibrations with an acceleration amplitude of 0.5gRMS in the frequency range between 38 and 49Hz, yielding an operating bandwidth of 12Hz. Such operating bandwidth is up to 71.4% greater than tailored commercial energy harvesting solutions under the same experimental conditions. Innovative multi-source power management circuits which exploit the series-like and parallel-like combinations of multiple power management units are presented. The limitations of traditional topologies are overcome by connecting each piezoelectric converter to a power management unit. In particular, the proposed inverting, buck-boost, parallel-like, power management circuit combines the energy from the storage capacitors of each power management unit in a single storage capacitor exploiting a switch on inductor through trigger circuits. Experimental results show that the proposed inverting buck-boost power stage has an overall efficiency of about 8.5%.",

These advancements are expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response (DR) programs. As various national and international organizations have started to draw PLC regulations, standards and technologies for countries, these standards intend to determine important criteria such as bandwidth, modulation types, channel coding schemes, operating frequency and electromagnetic capability limits from fixed indoor/outdoor applications to smart grid (SG) applications. Depending on the worldwide PLC regulation, standardization and technological developments, security schemes built around them can become interoperable from a standard point of view, but still have incompatible configurations or different maturity levels, or include non-standardized PLC functions. Moreover, the PLC based systems/solutions for renewable energy integration, are also surveyed in terms of distributed-power system (DPS) and distributed energy resources (DERs) units monitoring/controlling and management purposes. Thus, a particular section is dedicated to PLC based systems/solutions utilization of renewable energy sources (RESs) in SG covering all aspects of a monotype and hybrid energy plants.

Rural communities are the most important component of rural areas; as such, developing low-carbon communities will likely promote reductions in rural carbon emissions. As one of the low-carbon pilot provinces, Guangdong Province has gradually constructed low-carbon communities; however, neither the province nor China as a whole has established a system for evaluating different energy-related factors in rural low-carbon communities. Using real-world conditions in Guangdong Province, combined with the general parameters associated with low-carbon communities, this study evaluated six categorical factors: carbon reduction performance, low-carbon planning, energy consumption, low-carbon transportation, environment and resources, and low-carbon management and living. These categories were measured using several suitable indices according to the SMART principle. The baseline value corresponding to each index was determined by two zones: the Pearl River Delta zone and the non-Pearl River Delta zone. Each index weight was calculated using a method that combines a Monte Carlo simulation and an Analytical Hierarchy Process. Ultimately, one typical community was selected for a pilot evaluation. The sensitivity analysis of each index was conducted using the One-At-a-Time (OAT) method. Establishing this system is beneficial for promoting rural low-carbon communities construction in Guangdong Province, and supports system evaluation and adoption in rural low-carbon communities. This study’s system can also provide a reference case and experience for the Chinese government, as it establishes a system for evaluating rural low-carbon communities at the national level.",

This article aims at modelling the residential sector and assesses the different levels of technology deployment to control the electricity consumption of household appliances. The number of inhabitants and their habits are also considered, and the response levels of users towards control systems are simulated. For this matter, a Markov-chain algorithm was developed for synthesising the electric load and introducing Home Energy Management System (HEMS). The emission levels from electricity consumption were assessed based on hourly CO2 emission data from electricity production in Finland. Numerous electricity pricing models were also included, to assess the economic impacts of HEMS. The article suggests that a fully deployed HEMS may not be profitable for households with a low number of inhabitants. This is because the power consumption of appliances in stand-by mode offsets the positive impacts of HEMS on the electricity consumption profile.",

The number of captured situations in the environment and quantity and variety of devices in the system produce considerable amounts of data, which should be processed, understood and followed by corresponding actions. However, fully delivered to the user regardless of their role in the system and needs, data flows cause cognitive overload and thus may compromise the safety of the system depending on the timely response of the operators. This paper addresses the problem of selective information delivery with respect to the user׳s role in the system, his needs and responsibilities, by proposing context-aware information management middleware. The system utilizes Semantic Web technologies by capturing relevant information in the knowledge model of the system, which decouples data from the application logics. A clear division of data and application logics enables context-awareness and facilitates the reconfiguration process, when new information should be added into the system. The chosen approach is justified with an analysis of main trends in context-aware solutions. The engineering principles of the knowledge model are described and illustrated with simple scenarios from the building automation domain. The prototype developed proves the feasibility of the approach via performance evaluation and demonstrates the reconfiguration capabilities of information flows in the system. Further work assumes the extension of the knowledge model and integration of the system with adaptive human–machine interfaces for multi-role and multi-user environments.",

abstract = "Wireless body sensor networks are expected to extend human-centered applications in large-scale sensing and detecting environments. Energy savings has become one of the most important features of the sensor nodes to prolong their lifetime in such networks. To provide reasonable energy consumption and to improve the network lifetime of wireless body sensor network systems, new and efficient energy-saving schemes must be developed. An energy-saving routing architecture with a uniform clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper to reduce the energy consumption in wireless body sensor networks. We adopted centralized and cluster-based techniques to create a cluster-tree routing structure for the sensor nodes. The main goal of this scheme is to reduce the data transmission distances of the sensor nodes by using the uniform cluster structure concepts. To make an ideal cluster distribution, the distances between the sensor nodes are calculated, and the residual energy of each sensor node is accounted for when selecting the appropriate cluster head nodes. On the basis of the uniform cluster location, the data transmission distances between the sensor nodes can be reduced by employing an adaptive multi-hop approach. The energy consumption is reduced, and the lifetime is extended for the sensor nodes by balancing the network load among the clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the previously known schemes in terms of the energy consumption and the network lifetime for the wireless body sensor networks.",

CEP effectively supports the implementation of “sense and respond” behaviours, as it enables to extract meaningful events from raw data streams originated by sensing infrastructures, for enterprise processes and applications consumption. This paper proposes a novel CEP engine conceived with ease of use, extensibility, portability, and scalability requirements in mind. More specifically, we propose a Lightweight Stage-based Event Processor (LiSEP) based on a layered architectural design. Thanks to the adoption of Staged Event-Driven Architecture principles, core event processing logic is decoupled from low-level thread management issues. This results in an easy-to-understand and extensible implementation while testing results show performance scalability. We report on the carrying out of a case study on dangerous goods monitoring in maritime transport. The objective of the case study is to develop a Proof of Concept application leveraging on LiSEP capabilities in sensor and RFID events processing for monitoring and alerting purposes.",

Based on a literature review, a creative idea generation process was developed; it consists of four successive phases (Future envision, Opportunity identification and analysis, Idea generation, and Idea expansion) and one supportive phase (Ideation control). From various research fields, 70 idea generation techniques were collected and classified into phases of the process. To identify implicit and latent opportunities, the future envision method was developed based on a factor combination approach. In assessments by four experts in IT, the ideas generated by the UX-driven idea generation methodology got higher scores than brainstorming approach in novelty and relevance, but not in feasibility. The effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction was greater in the group who used the UX-driven idea generation methodology. Relevance to industry: The idea generation methodology suggested in this study can help indusial designers such as novice designers, analytical individuals as well as intuitive individuals who adhere to initial ideas. The UX-driven methodology can be used as a guideline when selecting an idea generation technique in the FFE.",

This paper provides a survey on state scheduling-based topology control techniques for unattended wireless sensor networks. Topology control algorithms for both flat and hierarchical networks are discussed. The algorithms are further categorized according to the key parameters used for state scheduling.

abstract = "With reference to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, many solutions have been formulated to face the different facets of layer-2 security. Unfortunately, the opportunities and subtleties arising from their joint adoption has been not investigated, due to the lack of an integrating framework. To this end, hereby a novel standard compatible framework is proposed, which is able to orchestrate several layer-2 security mechanisms with a limited computational footprint. Conceived as a distributed scheme, it covers the following key features: (i) multiple security configurations in homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) adaption to dynamic networks; (iii) lean and scalable initialization functionalities; (iv) lightweight Key Management Protocol; and (v) resilience to several attacks. The robustness against security attacks have been evaluated through a well-known automatic cryptographic protocol verifier, namely ProVerif. Moreover, to further demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed framework has been implemented within the emerging OpenWSN protocol stack, experimentally evaluated, and compared with respect to the ZigBee IP security architecture, which integrates the Symmetric Key - Key Establishment protocol (SKKE). Results clearly show that, although security features in constrained nodes incur not negligible computational costs (which impair latencies and energy efficiency), the proposed approach always guarantees better performances with respect to the ZigBee IP security architecture. In fact, it speeds up the configuration of security services (up to 120%), while ensuring relevant energy savings (larger than 50%).",

To address this, we introduce design models as a special class of conceptual models that support design processes for IS in general and UIS in particular. Design models for UIS are concise abstract conceptual models of key situations that conceive social, informational, physical, and service properties as requirements for targeted Information Systems. In this paper, we show how design models can be derived from narratives of key situations, guided by information systems ontologies, and domain specific input theories. This conceptual level offers an innovative approach for designing Ubiquitous Information Systems (UIS) in general and Healthcare Ubiquitous Information Systems (H-UIS) in particular. The proposed design approach is applied for developing H-UIS for reducing Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) by improving the communications between patients and healthcare professionals. Using the domain specific input theory of Health Promotion Model (HPM), the modeling guidelines for design models are generated and utilized in the development of a H-UIS to avoid ADEs. The H-UIS improves several processes involving information technologies for healthcare professionals. The system is empirically evaluated and results show high level of interest among users and initial positive adoption effects.

The QoC added features include constructs to express context situations (i.e. constraints on context information), quality requirements and quality levels. The new constructs have been mapped to code for two frameworks supporting QoC (COSMOS and SAMURAI). These mappings have been validated by means of a case study.",

As existing taxonomies cover information security-related aspects, while neglecting privacy-specific properties, this work aims at filling this gap by describing a universal taxonomy of PETs where the taxonomy aspects are selected such that they allow the categorization of PETs in different dimensions and properties to cover a wide area of privacy (e.g., user privacy, data privacy). It provides the reader with a tool for the systematic comparison of different PETs. This helps in identifying limitations of existing PETs, complementary technologies, and potential research directions. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed taxonomy is applied to a set of key technologies covering different disciplines such as data anonymization, privacy-preserving data querying, communication protection, and identity hiding.",

The Smart City encapsulates all the desires and prospects on the transformative and disruptive role technology will have in solving urban issues both in Global North and Global South cities. Critical scholarship has pointed out that private capital, with the blessing of technocratic elites, has found a techno-environmental fix to both reshuffle economic growth and prevent other alternative politico-ecological transitions to take root in urban systems. Against this bleak outlook, the paper argues that these technological assemblages might be compatible with alternative post-capitalist urban transformations aligned with Degrowth. Through a cross-reading of research on Smart Cities with theoretical perspectives drawn from the literature on Degrowth, I suggest that Degrowth should not refrain from engaging with urban technological imaginaries in a critical and selective way. As the paper shows through alternative uses of Smart technologies and digital open-source fabrication, the question is not so much around technology per se but around the wider politico-economic context into which these technological assemblages are embedded.",

While specific combinations of BPM and CEP have attracted research attention, resulting in solutions to specific problems, we attempt to take a broad view at the opportunities and challenges involved. We first illustrate these by a detailed example from the logistics domain. We then propose a mapping of this area into four quadrants – two quadrants drawing from CEP to create or extend process models and two quadrants starting from a process model to address how it can guide CEP. Existing literature is reviewed and specific challenges and opportunities are indicated for each of these quadrants. Based on this mapping, we identify challenges and opportunities that recur across quadrants and can be considered as the core issues of this combination. We suggest that addressing these issues in a generic manner would form a sound basis for future applications and advance this area significantly.",

abstract = "Circular Economy (CE) aims to overcome the take-make-dispose linear pattern of production and consumption, proposing a circular system in which the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy as long as possible. In recent years there has been a proliferation of scholars' publications on the topic. This study presents the results of a systematic literature review exploring the state-of-the-art of academic research on CE. The paper examines the CE body of literature with a systematic approach, to provide an exhaustive analysis of the phenomenon with rigorous and reproducible research criteria. The revisited material consists of 565 articles collected through the Web of Science and Scopus databases, and has been evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group literature into analytical categories. Starting from being a concept studied in connection with industrial ecology, CE has slowly acquired its independent role in academic research, framed mainly into environmental sustainability related studies. As a result of policies implementation, academic production is mainly concentrated in China and Europe, employing tools and methods for modelling processes and supporting decision-making for CE implementation (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment and Material Flow Analysis). CE studies follow three main lines of action: the first aims to change the social and economic dynamics at macro and administrative level; the second to support firms in circular processes implementation at micro level to spread new forms of consumption and product design; the third, developed at meso level, discusses industrial symbiosis experiences. CE is associated with a variety of concepts, and waste management emerges as the most relevant sub-sector. CE is also strongly connected with the concept of sustainability, proposing ways to operationalize its implementation at the environmental and economic level, while scholars only marginally consider social and institutional implications. The most explored practices are those related to cleaner production, aiming at reducing environmental impact and waste production along the life cycle of a product, and optimizing the performance and efficiency of processes. Conversely, studies on CE may devote greater attention to strategies for social and institutional changes, able to transform the upstream process of production and consumption. Considering business model strategies, scholars mainly focus on studying closing material loops strategy, while slowing the loops, which requires a radical change of consumption and production patterns, is only marginally included with respect to CE implementation. This study's findings highlight CE as an evolving concept that still requires development to consolidate its definition, boundaries, principles and associated practices.",

This paper introduces a systematic approach to service personalisation for mobile users in pervasive environments and presents a service-oriented distributed system architecture. The developed approach makes use of semantic technologies for user modelling and personalisation reasoning. In the paper we characterise user behaviours and needs in pervasive environments upon which ontological user models are created with special emphasis being placed on ontological modelling of dynamic and adaptive user profiles. We develop a rule-based personalisation mechanism that exploits semantic web rule mark-up language for rule design and a combination of semantic and rule-based reasoning for personalisation. We use two case studies focusing on providing personalised travel assistance for people using Help-on-Demand services deployed on a smart-phone to contextualise the discussions within the paper. The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype system, which includes Help-on-Demand services, content management services, user models and personalisation mechanisms in addition to application specific rules. Experiments have been designed and conducted to test and evaluate the approach with initial results demonstrating the functionality of the approach.",

Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.",

However, recently, smart TV's performance in the pay-TV market has been below expectations. In the socio-technical view, this paper investigates three aspects surrounding smart TV: bundling as a market competition strategy; services using technological features represented by N-screen; and consumer attributes, including personal innovativeness and demographics. The results show that the bundles with IPTV have a lock-in effect, while other pay-TV services do not, indicating that bundling by communications service providers is a more effective strategy to keep market share away from new entrants. Policy makers only consider competition among incumbents, neglecting the entrance of new service providers, like over-the-top service providers. Therefore, bundling should be evaluated in terms of an entry barrier. Smart TV doesn't work as a platform because the adoption of smart TV has no influence on the watching of N-screen broadcasting services on TV. There are implications that the new technology alone cannot encourage lean-forward activity on TV. Managers should focus on what consumers expect from ‘smartness’, and develop contents for the smart TV as a home appliance.",

In particular, two paths of the direct effects on perceived benefits and risks that induce the ultimate intention to disclose personal information via mobile apps were proposed and empirically tested. The analysis showed that self-presentation and personalized services positively influence consumers’ perceived benefits, which in turn positively affects the intention to disclose personal information. Perceived severity and perceived control serve as the direct antecedents of perceived risks that negatively affect the intention of consumers to disclose personal information. Compared with the perceived risks, the perceived benefits more strongly influence the intention to disclose personal information. This study extends the literature on privacy concerns to consumer intention to disclose personal information by theoretically developing and empirically testing four hypotheses in a research model.

Since sensing results of Body Area Networks (BAN) can directly impact the control of medical equipment, the authenticity and integrity of sensing data is essential for safety of patients. Restricted by the limited resources available to BAN sensors, researchers have referred to Physical Unclonable Function of the nodes to achieve authentication. Existing approaches focus on the authentication between control unit and sensors. Mutual authentication between sensor pairs or among sensor groups has not been carefully studied. In this paper, we propose to design several mutual authentication mechanisms for BAN sensor pairs and sensor groups with physical unclonable functions (PUF). Using control unit as a middle point, the body sensors can establish shared secrets so that authenticity of exchanged data can be protected. In sensor groups of BAN, we design both control unit based and sensor based sender authentication mechanisms. To reduce hardware demand and overhead, the proposed approaches do not require sensors to conduct any encryption operations, which suits the restricted resources available to BAN nodes.

abstract = "In the big data era, new technologies and powerful analytics make it possible to collect and analyse large amounts of data in order to identify patterns in the behaviour of groups, communities and even entire countries. Existing case law and regulations are inadequate to address the potential risks and issues related to this change of paradigm in social investigation. This is due to the fact that both the right to privacy and the more recent right to data protection are protected as individual rights. The social dimension of these rights has been taken into account by courts and policymakers in various countries. Nevertheless, the rights holder has always been the data subject and the rights related to informational privacy have mainly been exercised by individuals. This atomistic approach shows its limits in the existing context of mass predictive analysis, where the larger scale of data processing and the deeper analysis of information make it necessary to consider another layer, which is different from individual rights. This new layer is represented by the collective dimension of data protection, which protects groups of persons from the potential harms of discriminatory and invasive forms of data processing. On the basis of the distinction between individual, group and collective dimensions of privacy and data protection, the author outlines the main elements that characterise the collective dimension of these rights and the representation of the underlying interests.",

The scope of this paper is to examine the perceptions of adopters and non-adopters of online utility management, in terms of their experience towards existing service delivery approaches and their expectations of future innovations as regards perceived characteristics. The user perceptions contribute to defining an initial roadmap for exploring the evolution of ‘utilities service management’ on the Internet and their approaches to online service delivery. It highlights the general need for a value-added and integrated utilities service management solution as well as the specific demand of internet users for the integrated online delivery of utilities services to serve their particular interests. This paper discusses several traditional approaches in related fields of electronic service delivery and shows how the current situation demands a shift towards an integrated utilities service management solution that considers the interests of all stakeholders.",

We introduce a scheduling-based cooperation incentive scheme which enables machine nodes to organize themselves locally, create machine groups, and communicate through group representatives to the base station. This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which takes into account the cooperation level of each node, reimburses the extra energy consumptions of group representatives, and maximizes the network lifetime. As reusing cellular uplink resources for communications inside the groups degrades the Quality of Service (QoS) of the primary users, analytical results are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number of simultaneously active machine groups in a given cell and QoS of the primary users. Furthermore, we extend our derived solutions for the existing cellular networks, propose a cooperation-incentive LTE scheduler, and present our simulation results in the context of LTE. The simulation results show that the proposed solutions significantly prolong the network lifetime. Also, it is shown that under certain circumstances, reusing uplink resource by machine devices can degrade the outage performance of the primary users significantly, and hence, coexistence management of machine devices and cellular users is of paramount importance for next generations of cellular networks in order to enable group-based machine-type communications while guaranteeing QoS for the primary users.",

While recommendation plays an increasingly critical role in our living, study, work, and entertainment, the recommendations we receive are often for irrelevant, duplicate, or uninteresting products and services. A critical reason for such bad recommendations lies in the intrinsic assumption that recommended users and items are independent and identically distributed (IID) in existing theories and systems. Another phenomenon is that, while tremendous efforts have been made to model specific aspects of users or items, the overall user and item characteristics and their non-IIDness have been overlooked. In this paper, the non-IID nature and characteristics of recommendation are discussed, followed by the non-IID theoretical framework in order to build a deep and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic nature of recommendation problems, from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. This non-IID recommendation research triggers the paradigm shift from IID to non-IID recommendation research and can hopefully deliver informed, relevant, personalized, and actionable recommendations. It creates exciting new directions and fundamental solutions to address various complexities including cold-start, sparse data-based, cross-domain, group-based, and shilling attack-related issues.",

It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN). Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN. Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples. Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies.",

Drawing from literature on innovation, strategy and culture the objective of this study is to explore the role of perceived potentials and perceived strategic importance on CIOs’ perspective on RFID technology in two different cultural settings.
Methodology
Based on survey responses from 463 German and 157 Italian IT decision makers we analyzed the data with PLS structural equation modeling.
Findings
We show that perceived potentials of RFID influence the perceived strategic importance which positively influences CIOs’ intention to invest in RFID. The composition of perceived potentials affecting the strategic importance of RFID differs significantly in both cultures. In Germany, potentials attributed to RFID are improving quality, automating manpower, reducing counterfeits, and improving customer service. Italian CIOs value reducing stock inconsistencies, optimizing stock keeping, and improving customer service as RFID potentials. Regardless of culture, findings show that company size hardly has impact on perceived strategic importance.
Originality/value
This research shows on a large empirical basis cultural differences in the perception of RFID in two countries using PLS.",

We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle.

abstract = "With the advancements in contemporary multi-core CPU architectures and increase in main memory capacity, it is now possible for a server operating system (OS), such as Linux, to handle a large number of concurrent application services on a single server instance. Individual application components of such services may run in different isolated runtime environments, such as chrooted jails or application containers, and may need access to system resources and the ability to collaborate and coordinate with each other in a regulated and secure manner. We implemented an access control framework for policy formulation, management, and enforcement that allows access to OS resources and also permits controlled collaboration and coordination for service components running in disjoint containerized environments under a single Linux OS server instance. The framework consists of two models and the policy formulation is based on the concept of policy classes for ease of administration and enforcement. The policy classes are managed and enforced through a Linux Policy Machine (LPM) that acts as the centralized reference monitor and provides a uniform interface for accessing system resources and requesting application data and control objects. We present the details of our framework and also discuss the preliminary implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

abstract = "Localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is regarded as an emerging technology for numerous cyber-physical system applications, which equips wireless sensors with the capability to report data that is geographically meaningful for location based services and applications. However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart sensors in WSN, a single localization technique that affects the overall performance is not sufficient for all applications. Thus, there have been many significant advances on localization techniques in WSNs in the past few years. The main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for localization in WSNs. Specifically, we present the recent advances on localization techniques in WSNs by considering a wide variety of factors and categorizing them in terms of data processing (centralized vs. distributed), transmission range (range free vs. range based), mobility (static vs. mobile), operating environments (indoor vs. outdoor), node density (sparse vs. dense), routing, algorithms, etc. The recent localization techniques in WSNs are also summarized in the form of tables. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of localization in sensor networks, as well as research trends and future research directions in this area.",

Leveraging the increasing variety of connectivity options available to devices solves many problems such as capacity, spectrum efficiency, coverage and reliability. Anytime decisions are made for selection, handover, scheduling or routing many performance metrics along with energy efficiency and cost for access must be considered. The increased number of choices in an HWN makes the problem more difficult than traditional homogeneous networks since each Radio Access Technology (RAT) has unique characteristics. For instance, Bluetooth networks have low range and speed but are cheap compared to 4G networks. These types of observations can be factored into decision making in HWNs. Quality of Service and Experience should be considered so that the best possible configuration of connectivity, price and user application is made. All of this should occur autonomously. This paper provides a survey of recent works in HWNs with these ideas in mind. Existing approaches are categorized by function. Limitations and strengths of solutions are highlighted and comparisons between approaches are made to provide a starting point for further research in the area.",

Starting from 2006, a comprehensive regulation of the information issues in Russia began to emerge, having immediate practical effect not only on national parties, but also – due to developments in approaches to jurisdiction – to parties acting in digital environment internationally. The purpose of the research is to consider ‘narrow’ approach to the legal definition of personal data (as the trigger of personal data legislation) in the regulatory environment of the Russian Federation in the context of regulation of informational and telecommunication technologies with a particular focus on ‘Big Data’. The problem considered implies the balance between the principle of formal certainty of legal norms, on the one hand, and technological developments, on the other. The formal definition of personal data shall be interpreted uniformly to ensure consistent and predictable application of law which appears not reliably possible at the moment, although the Russian definition of personal data corresponds to the CETS Convention No. 108 which Russia is a party to. As the analysis of the Russian court practice shows, the courts are applying the broad definition interpreting it as if it has at least two additional criteria: that a set of data should be enough to identify an individual and that only a set of data in possession of a particular operator should be considered. It is suggested that these criteria find reflection in “surgical” amendments to the legislation, and the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act, 1998 can serve as a source of adoption in terms of comparative law. Furthermore, the article discusses whether the ‘narrow’ approach may be viewed as contributing to privacy protection in the age of Big Data, rather than lowering barriers of privacy. The authors explain that the ‘narrow’ approach may be considered positive in this aspect because it allows keeping the existing general privacy regulation workable in a reasonably predictable manner. Besides, the research may serve as an introductory material into the Russian data protection legislation.",

We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields.",

They conclude that the broad brush policies of the past are not likely to be adequate to deal with the new challenges and that we are probably entering an era that will require development of “micro-policies”. While the new technologies will pose many challenges, perhaps the biggest challenge of all will be to ensure coherence of these micro-policies.",

A future smart grid must fulfill the vision of the Energy Internet in which millions of people produce their own energy from renewables in their homes, offices, and factories and share it with each other. Electric vehicles and local energy storage will be widely deployed. Internet technology will be utilized to transform the power grid into an energy-sharing inter-grid. To prepare for the future, a smart grid with intelligent periphery, or smart GRIP, is proposed. The building blocks of GRIP architecture are called clusters and include an energy-management system (EMS)-controlled transmission grid in the core and distribution grids, micro-grids, and smart buildings and homes on the periphery; all of which are hierarchically structured. The layered architecture of GRIP allows a seamless transition from the present to the future and plug-and-play interoperability. The basic functions of a cluster consist of ① dispatch, ② smoothing, and ③ mitigation. A risk-limiting dispatch methodology is presented; a new device, called the electric spring, is developed for smoothing out fluctuations in periphery clusters; and means to mitigate failures are discussed.",

The ubiquity of such sensing devices offers the potential to realise novel applications based on collaborative sensing, in which application logic makes use of sensor input from a number of handsets, typically distributed across a defined physical area. Such applications will be enabled by mobile cloud computing, with the devices transferring raw or pre-processed sensed data to application logic hosted in the cloud. This results in a trade-off between the quality of the sensed data received by applications and the energy required to transfer data from the mobile handsets. We address this trade-off by considering a scheme in which a collaborative sensing middleware mediates between multiple applications requiring sensed data and the mobile handsets located within a particular physical area. We present and evaluate an algorithm which seeks to maximise the degree to which sensed data transferred from a given mobile device can be served to more than one application. We show that this algorithm leads to better overall performance in terms of energy used than an algorithm which does not aggregate sensed information between applications.",

However, it may be cost-prohibitive to replace exhausted batteries or even impossible in hostile environments. On the other hand, unlike other networks, WSNs are designed for specific applications which range from small-size healthcare surveillance systems to large-scale environmental monitoring. Thus, any WSN deployment has to satisfy a set of requirements that differs from one application to another. In this context, a host of research work has been conducted in order to propose a wide range of solutions to the energy-saving problem. This research covers several areas going from physical layer optimisation to network layer solutions. Therefore, it is not easy for the WSN designer to select the efficient solutions that should be considered in the design of application-specific WSN architecture. We present a top-down survey of the trade-offs between application requirements and lifetime extension that arise when designing wireless sensor networks. We first identify the main categories of applications and their specific requirements. Then we present a new classification of energy-conservation schemes found in the recent literature, followed by a systematic discussion as to how these schemes conflict with the specific requirements. Finally, we survey the techniques applied in WSNs to achieve trade-off between multiple requirements, such as multi-objective optimisation.",

This paper presents a spatiotemporal pattern detection algorithm that can detect hazardous content in streaming video in real time. A tool is developed for producing test videos with hazardous content, and then those test videos are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm, as well as an existing post-processing tool that is currently being used for detecting such patterns. To perform the detection in real time, the proposed algorithm was implemented on a dual core processor, using a pipelined/parallel software architecture. Results indicate that the proposed method provides better detection performance, allowing for the masking of seizure inducing patterns in real time.",

Many critical WSN applications need not only reliability, but also the ability to adequately cope with the movement of nodes between different sub-networks. Despite the work of IETF’s 6lowPAN WG and work on the use of MIPv6 (and many of its variants) in WSNs, no practical mobility support solution exists for this type of networks. In this paper we start by assessing the use of MIPv6 in WSNs, considering soft and hard handoff, showing that, although feasible in small networks, MIPv6 complexity leads to long handoff time and high energy consumption. In order to solve these problems, we propose a proxy-based mobility approach which, by relieving resource-constrained sensor nodes from heavy mobility management tasks, drastically reduces time and energy expenditure during handoff. The evaluation of both MIPv6 and the proposed solution is done by implementation and simulation, with a varying number of nodes, sinks and mobility strategies.",

In the light of the recent UK Research Council funded Environmental Virtual Observatory pilot project, this paper gives an overview of currently available implementations related to web-based technologies for processing large and heterogeneous datasets and discuss their relevance within the context of environmental data processing, simulation and prediction. We found that, the processing of the simple datasets used in the pilot proved to be relatively straightforward using a combination of R, RPy2, PyWPS and PostgreSQL. However, the use of NoSQL databases and more versatile frameworks such as OGC standard based implementations may provide a wider and more flexible set of features that particularly facilitate working with larger volumes and more heterogeneous data sources.",

abstract = "Utility regulation in the United States (US) was founded partly on a consensus that raw marketplace economics ignored social justice, including universal service goals. The century-old ‘regulatory compact’ in most jurisdictions offers ‘just and reasonable rates’ in exchange for investment in public services. Justice has come to justify such low-income supports as discounted rates, arrearage forgiveness, limitations on service termination, and low/no cost energy efficiency. The consensus for regulation has now evolved to encompass carbon reduction, and has led to, amongst other things, the promotion of domestic forms of renewable energy known as ‘distributed generation’ (DG). However, such technologies potentially threaten the current regulatory balance that includes ameliorating energy poverty, because DG reduces utility sales but not utility fixed costs and so contributes to higher bills for low-income households that cannot afford such DG investments as rooftop solar, solar domestic hot water, and cogeneration. The aim of this paper is to analyze how utility regulation might evolve to encompass modern energy developments, thus addressing both the goals of reducing carbon and amerliorating fuel poverty. It begins by reviewing the origin of US utility regulation and describes the regulatory compact that resulted. It then discusses possible balancing measures, including tax-based subsidies, system benefit charges (taxes) on DG, stricter application of just and reasonable regulatory principles, and low-income-specific approaches to DG.",

Previous scenario studies on privacy have focused on macro trends and on forecasting technological developments, and claims about causal influences have remained implicit. This article presents an alternative approach for constructing scenarios of privacy protection. The article focuses on privacy protection as a social institution and builds on the theory of gradual institutional change. The article presents a scenario framework which includes three stages: (1) outlining the dynamics of privacy protection, (2) tracing historical processes and constructing a causal narrative, and (3) creating event-based scenarios. The resulting scenarios are narratives of plausible chains of events which are based on the results of the previous stages. The key difference to typical scenario approaches is the focus on specific actors and types of event sequences in privacy protection. The argument is that by lowering the level of abstraction in this way, researchers and decision-makers can gain a more profound understanding of possible future challenges in privacy protection and of key leverage points in the institutional change process.",

This paper argues, based on a bibliometric study of the representation of a mobile ICT discourse within the AIS Senior Scholars’ ‘basket’ of eight IS journals over the past 15years, that the field needs to become much more academically agile. The study showed that a mere 3.2% of all papers published during this period had any relationship to one of the key technological phenomena in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The paper formulates the hypothesis that the relative shift in impact between European- and US-based journals within the ‘basket of 8’ could have been influenced by editorial strategising to further encourage academic agility exploring new horizons rather than emphasis on further exploitation of existing ground. The paper, further argues that the IS field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much more difficult to gain a foothold. So, whilst the IS field may still be stuck in the mainframe age, it needs to move beyond in order to fully engage with the world we live in.",

abstract = "Cloud computing offers various services to users by re-arranging storage and computing resources. In order to preserve data privacy, cloud users may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the cloud. However, processing and analyzing encrypted data are challenging problems, which have received increasing attention in recent years. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) was proposed to support computation on encrypted data and ensure data confidentiality simultaneously. However, a limitation of HE is it is a single user system, which means it only allows the party that owns a homomorphic decryption key to decrypt processed ciphertexts. Original HE cannot support multiple users to access the processed ciphertexts flexibly. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Data Processing (PPDP) system with the support of a Homomorphic Re-Encryption Scheme (HRES). The HRES extends partial HE from a single-user system to a multi-user one by offering ciphertext re-encryption to allow multiple users to access processed ciphertexts. Through the cooperation of a Data Service Provider (DSP) and an Access Control Server (ACS), the PPDP system can support seven basic operations over ciphertexts, which include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Sign Acquisition, Comparison, Equivalent Test, and Variance. To enhance the flexibility and security of our system, we further apply multiple ACSs to take in charge of the data from their own users and design computing operations over ciphertexts belonging to multiple ACSs. We then prove the security of PPDP, analyze its performance and advantages by comparing with some latest work, and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through simulations with regard to big data process.",

abstract = "The design of high-performance application-specific multi-core processor systems still is a time consuming task which involves many manual steps and decisions that need to be performed by experienced design engineers. The ASAM project sought to change this by proposing an automatic architecture synthesis and mapping flow aimed at the design of such application specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) systems. The ASAM flow separated the design problem into two cooperating exploration levels, known as the macro-level and micro-level exploration. This paper presents an overview of the micro-level exploration level, which is concerned with the analysis and design of individual processors within the overall multi-core design starting at the initial exploration stages but continuing up to the selection of the final design of the individual processors within the system. The designed processors use a combination of very-long instruction-word (VLIW), single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD), and complex custom DSP-like operations in order to provide an area- and energy-efficient and high-performance execution of the program parts assigned to the processor node. In this paper we present an overview of how the micro-level design space exploration interacts with the macro-level, how early performance estimates are used within the ASAM flow to determine the tasks executed by each processor node, and how an initial processor design is then proposed and refined into a highly specialized VLIW ASIP. The micro-level architecture exploration is then demonstrated with a walk-through description of the process on an example program kernel to further clarify the exploration and architecture specialization process. The main findings of the experimental research are that the presented method enables an automatic instruction-set architecture synthesis for VLIW ASIPs within a reasonable exploration time. Using the presented approach, we were able to automatically determine an initial architecture prototype that was able to meet the temporal performance requirements of the target application. Subsequently, refinement of this architecture considerably reduced both the design area (by 4x) and the active energy consumption (by 2x).",

This inevitable transformation to highly connected systems thus necessitates effective security safeguards to be in place as any compromise or downtime of SCADA systems can have severe economic, safety and security ramifications. One way to ensure vital asset protection is to adopt a viewpoint similar to an attacker to determine weaknesses and loopholes in defences. Such mind sets help to identify and fix potential breaches before their exploitation. This paper surveys tools and techniques to uncover SCADA system vulnerabilities.

This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business services and distributive trade services. Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics.

However, the traditional risk evaluation methods are neither accurate nor dynamic because they stick to the statistical data and neglect the important temporal effects of the vital signs. This paper proposes a new linear time-invariant model-based CHD evaluation method, which allows evaluating the CHD development dynamically over the whole lifetime. Currently identified model can give the dynamic evaluation of 43–77 years with about 5% errors in comparison with the clinical gold standard, the SYNTAX score. In addition, the model also gives a quantitative weight to each risk factor, which is also helpful for risk control in both clinics and ubiquitous healthcare. Current application of this approach in clinics has proved its efficiency in the pre-diagnosing and post-clinical ubiquitous health management.",

To select a suitable cryptographic algorithm for an application or an environment, the understandings of both the algorithmic requirements in terms of hardware and the specifications of the development platform intended has to be established. However, there are numerous ciphers in the literature that has various functionality, specifications and strength. Moreover, there are numerous literatures that cover the trend and specifications of security solutions in hardware constrained environment, employing known cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of modern symmetric cryptographic solutions used in resource constrained environment (RCE), including literatures from the area of wireless sensor network (WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) and other resource constrained platforms. This paper aims to provide a survey of the ciphers that were used in the past, and what are the ciphers that are currently active, and their respective specifications and applications in the area of modern world RCEs. On top of that, descriptive summaries of (a total of 100 symmetric ciphers) modern block ciphers (38), involution ciphers (6), lightweight block ciphers (28) and stream ciphers (28) are included and discussed, and an overview of the current contributions of various literatures, comparison and analysis of modern ciphers from the hardware and software perspective are also discussed.",

abstract = "This paper argues that hybrid human–agent systems can support powerful solutions to relevant problems such as Environmental Crisis management. However, it shows that such solutions require comprehensive approaches covering different aspects of data processing, model construction and the usage. In particular, the solutions (i) must be able to cope with complex correlations (as different data sources are used) and processing of large amounts of data, (ii) must be robust against modeling imperfections and (iii) human–machine interaction (HMI) approaches must facilitate human use of crisis management tools and reduce the likelihood of miscommunication. In this paper the relevant problem is an environmental protection application involving the detection and tracking of gases in case of chemical spills in an urban area. We show that a combination of Bayesian Networks, agent paradigm and systematic approaches to implementing HMI, support effective and robust solutions. To better integrate human information and demonstrate the usefulness of user generated crisis response information we developed a social media harvesting interface based on data from Twitter tweets and a visual interface to facilitate human smell classification.",

However, there exist many common significant challenges to be addressed for the practical realization of these current and envisioned networking paradigms such as the increased complexity with large scale networks, their dynamic nature, resource constraints, heterogeneous architectures, absence or impracticality of centralized control and infrastructure, need for survivability, and unattended resolution of potential failures. These challenges have been successfully dealt with by Nature, which, as a result of millions of years of evolution, have yielded many biological systems and processes with intrinsic appealing characteristics such as adaptivity to varying environmental conditions, inherent resiliency to failures and damages, successful and collaborative operation on the basis of a limited set of rules and with global intelligence which is larger than superposition of individuals, self-organization, survivability, and evolvability. Inspired by these characteristics, many researchers are currently engaged in developing innovative design paradigms to address the networking challenges of existing and envisioned information systems. In this paper, the current state-of-the-art in bio-inspired networking is captured. The existing bio-inspired networking and communication protocols and algorithms devised by looking at biology as a source of inspiration, and by mimicking the laws and dynamics governing these systems are presented along with open research issues for the bio-inspired networking. Furthermore, the domain of bio-inspired networking is linked to the emerging research domain of nanonetworks, which bring a set of unique challenges. The objective of this survey is to provide better understanding of the potentials for bio-inspired networking which is currently far from being fully recognized, and to motivate the research community to further explore this timely and exciting topic.",

In this context, engineers should be provided with proper modeling and programming abstractions to develop applications able to benefit from Future Internet, by being at the same time fluid, as well as dependable. Indeed, such abstractions should (i) facilitate the development of autonomous and independent interacting resources (loose coupling), (ii) deal with the run-time variability of the application in terms of involved resources (flexibility), (iii) provide mechanisms for run-time resources discovery and access (dynamism), and (iv) enable the running application to accommodate unforeseen resources (serendipity).

An insecure communication channel between a tag and a reader makes the RFID implant system vulnerable to attacks and endangers the user's safety and privacy. The proposed scheme relies on elliptic curve cryptography and the D-Quark lightweight hash design. Compared to the available public-key cryptosystems, elliptic curve-based cryptosystems are the best choice due to their small key sizes as well as their efficiency in computations. The D-Quark lightweight hash design is tailored for resource constrained pervasive devices, cost, and performance. The security analysis of the proposed authentication scheme revealed that it is secure against the relevant threat models and provides a higher security level than related work found in the literature. The computational performance comparison shows that our work has 48% less communication overhead compared to existing similar schemes. It also requires 24% less total memory than the other approaches. The required computational time of our scheme is generally similar to other existing schemes. Hence, the presented scheme is a well-suited choice for providing security for the resource-constrained RFID implant systems.",

Node clustering is a common technique to organize data traffic, reduce communication overhead and enable better network traffic management, improving scalability and energy efficiency. Although current clustering protocols treat various kinds of dynamicity in the network, such as mobility or cluster-head rotations, few solutions consider the readings similarity, which could provide benefits in terms of better use of compression techniques and reactive detection of anomalous events. For maintaining similarity aware clusters, the synchronization of the cluster’s average reading would allow a distributed and adaptive operation. In this article, we propose an architecture for dynamic and distributed data-aware clustering, and the Dynamic Data-aware Firefly-based Clustering (DDFC) protocol to handle spatial similarity between node readings. The DDFC operation takes into account the biological principles of fireflies to ensure distributed synchronization of the clusters’ similar readings aggregations. DDFC was compared to other protocols and the results demonstrated its capability of maintaining synchronized cluster readings aggregations, thereby enabling nodes to be dynamically clustered according to their readings.",

This paper takes as a starting point the proportionality test as used by the Court of Justice of the EU in its decisions and assesses whether this test is properly defined to accommodate technology developments and the increased surveillance of citizens with devices that are not originally built for the purpose of surveillance (e.g. mobile phones, computers/internet, GPS devices, etc.) and with data that are not originally collected for the purpose of dataveillance. The paper contributes to the existing debates on striking a balance between security and fundamental rights by introducing the so far neglected discussion of the nature of the devices used for surveillance. Due, not only to the level of intrusiveness, but also to the lack of proper legal safeguards for these (non-purpose built but surveillance-ready) devices, it is argued that the proportionality test elaborated by the Court in the Data Retention Directive case is not accurate as long as it does not take the nature of technology used for surveillance into account.",

Due to major meat crises and scandals the meat sector has in this respect attracted substantial attention. In this paper we identify regulatory, business, consumer and technological requirements for meat supply chain transparency systems and present a reference software architecture that will guide the realisation of these systems. The reference architecture is characterized by three main elements: the EPCIS standard for tracking and tracing, cloud-based realisation of transparency systems, and the provision of transparency systems as services by third-party transparency service providers (3pTSPs). Usage scenarios are presented to explain how the different types of meat supply chain actors can use transparency systems that are based on the architecture.",

These medical devices are surgically implanted into patient's bodies and wirelessly configured by prescribing physicians and healthcare professionals using external programmers. However, these devices are threatened by a set of lethal attacks, due to the use of vulnerable wireless communication and security protocols, and the lack of security protection mechanisms deployed on IMDs. In this paper, we propose a digital investigation system for the postmortem analysis of lethal attack scenarios on cardiac IMDs. After developing a set of techniques allowing the secure storage of digital evidence logs which track the executed sensitive events, we implement an in-depth security solution allowing the protection of cardiac IMDs. An inference system integrating a library of medical rules is proposed to automatically infer potential medical scenarios that caused the patient's death, or that created heart-related emergency situations (through the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia for example). A Model Checking based formal technique to reconstruct potential technical attack scenarios on a cardiac IMD, starting from the collected evidence, is also proposed. The results obtained by the two proposed reasoning techniques (i.e., the inference system and the Model Checking based algorithm) are correlated to prove whether a potential attack scenario is responsible of the occurrence of heart-related emergency situations or the death of a patient. Based on the proposed techniques, we design a decision-support system that reconciles in the same framework the medical and technical investigation aspects.",

In particular, a novel anomaly scoring method is proposed to provide a score for each hyperellipsoidal model, based on how remote the ellipsoid is relative to their neighbours. We demonstrate using several synthetic and real datasets that our proposed scheme achieves a higher detection performance with a significant reduction in communication overhead in the network compared to centralised and existing schemes.",

However, realizing self-management is not an easy task due to complexities of implementing autonomous behaviors. It has been recognized that a single autonomicity handling mechanism is not sufficient to realize comprehensive self-management capabilities when different technologies are involved. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach, the ‘LinkSmart Three Layered architectural (LinkSmart-3L) style’, in which different architecture styles are incorporated. The LinkSmart-3L style enables self-management at an architectural level. In our approach, semantic web technologies are used to achieve comprehensive context-awareness and extensibility of self-management capabilities, genetic algorithms are used to achieve configuration optimizations, and a planner is used to compute planning procedures on how to arrive at an optimum system configuration based on current architectural structure of the underlying system using an architectural query language. These technologies are integrated seamlessly based on the service oriented computing (SoC) paradigm. We have extensively evaluated both runtime and development time qualities of our implementation of the style. These evaluations can serve as guidelines for evaluating other middleware systems. We conclude that our approach is usable and effective in achieving these quality attributes.",

The design is based on a comprehensive set of requirements specifying relevant technical capabilities required to support a number of core facets of an integrated e-Participation model. In addition, the paper describes the software components for realizing the design and how an implementation of the SSI was employed as part of an e-Participation initiative in Europe. We conclude with some of the socio-technical challenges associated with implementing of some of the components of the Social Software Infrastructure.",

Increasing the efficiency of transportation systems alone will not solve these problems and may exacerbate them. Instead, we must extract new transportation capabilities related to more cooperative decision-making across a wide range of time horizons, spatial scales and decision contexts. This paper discusses the role of sensed transportation, geographic information science and social media to cultivate transportation systems where participants share, cooperate and act collectively to solve operational, tactical and strategic mobility and accessibility problems. This paper also provides a vision of the future by imaging a seamless multimodal transportation system combined with a virtual environment where data streams are fused, interpreted and made available with tools for human engagement and shared decision making. This paper concludes by outlining a GIScience-centric research agenda.",

In addition, along with the second solution, we propose a dynamic grouping solution, which groups MTC device with common subscription features in orders to control the MTC signaling traffics when the network is overloaded. Numerical results show the efficiency of using the proposed solutions compared to only grouping the MTC devices, and using a bulk signaling mechanism.",

In this case, Big Data is definitely a phenomenon that has a direct impact on the quality of life for those of us that choose to live in a town or city. Smart Cities of tomorrow will rely not only on sensors within the city infrastructure, but also on a large number of devices that will willingly sense and integrate their data into technological platforms used for introspection into the habits and situations of individuals and city-large communities. Predictions say that cities will generate over 4.1 terabytes per day per square kilometer of urbanized land area by 2016. Handling efficiently such amounts of data is already a challenge. In this paper we present our solutions designed to support next-generation Big Data applications. We first present CAPIM, a platform designed to automate the process of collecting and aggregating context information on a large scale. It integrates services designed to collect context data (location, user’s profile and characteristics, as well as the environment). Later on, we present a concrete implementation of an Intelligent Transportation System designed on top of CAPIM. The application is designed to assist users and city officials better understand traffic problems in large cities. Finally, we present a solution to handle efficient storage of context data on a large scale. The combination of these services provides support for intelligent Smart City applications, for actively and autonomously adaptation and smart provision of services and content, using the advantages of contextual information.",

Its applications are everywhere, supporting users in everyday activities in a transparent way with little or no need for attention. To ensure the adoption of these applications, it is essential to assess the quality of the interaction with its users. To do that, measurements can be applied to obtain data about quality characteristics in a software product. In a previous study about quality characteristics and software measures for ubiquitous computing, we have identified a gap in the literature regarding software measures for evaluating essential quality characteristics in ubiquitous systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a suite of well-defined software measures (twenty-four in total), called AQUArIUM, to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) in ubiquitous applications for mobile devices. These measures address five quality characteristics of ubiquitous computing: Context-awareness, Mobility, Attention, Calmness and Transparency. The proposed suite was validated theoretically and empirically. The results showed not only that the suite is feasible, but also that it indicates specific problems of HCI quality, which are helpful in improving the evaluated ubiquitous mobile application.",

In smart city, people can interact directly with the community and the infrastructure at anytime and anywhere, where GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) is an important network infrastructure for smart city. Recently, Gope and Hwang proposed an efficient authentication scheme for GLOMONET. However, we find their scheme lacks session key update and wrong password detection mechanisms, and vulnerable to denial-of-service attack. Besides, the session key can be known by HA (home agent), and perfect forward secrecy cannot be ensured. Furthermore, in their scheme, HA has to take heavy secret key management work. Based on previous work, this paper first summarizes the security and function requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment. Later, this paper proposed a robust biometrics based three-factor authentication scheme for GLOMONET in smart city. Security features of the proposed scheme are analyzed in detail, and comparisons of our scheme with other related schemes are illustrated. Analysis and comparison results show that our scheme meets the preconcerted security requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment, and it is robust for GLOMONET in smart city environments with higher security requirements.",

Today we typically manage multiple versions of self, made visible in digital trails distributed widely across offline and online spaces. Yet, technology-mediated identity leads us into crisis. Enduring accessibility to greater and growing personal details online, alongside increases in both computing power and data linkage techniques, fuel fears of identity exploitation. Will it be stolen? Who controls it? Are others aggregating or analysing our identities to infer new data about us without our knowledge or consent? New challenges present themselves globally around these fears, as manifested by concerns over massive online data breaches and automated identification technologies, which also highlight the conundrum faced by governments about how to safeguard individuals' interests on the Web while striking a fair balance with wider public interests. This paper reflects upon some of these problems as part of the inter-disciplinary, transatlantic ‘SuperIdentity’ project investigating links between cyber and real-world identifiers. To meet the crisis, we explore the relationship between identity and digitisation from the perspective of policy and law. We conclude that traditional models of identity protection need supplementing with new ways of thinking, including pioneering ‘technical-legal’ initiatives that are sensitive to the different risks that threaten our digital identity integrity. Only by re-conceiving identity dynamically to appreciate the increasing capabilities for connectivity between different aspects of our identity across the cyber and the physical domains, will policy and law be able to keep up with and address the challenges that lie ahead in our progressively networked world.",

A full knowledge and control of the current status of those resources enables Cloud administrators to design better Cloud provisioning strategies and to avoid SLA violations. However, it is not easy to manage such information in a reliable and scalable way, especially when we consider Cloud environments used and shared by several tenants and when we need to harmonize their different monitoring needs at different Cloud software stack layers. To cope with these issues, we propose Distributed Architecture for Resource manaGement and mOnitoring in cloudS (DARGOS), a completely distributed and highly efficient Cloud monitoring architecture to disseminate resource monitoring information. DARGOS ensures an accurate measurement of physical and virtual resources in the Cloud keeping at the same time a low overhead. In addition, DARGOS is flexible and adaptable and allows defining and monitoring new metrics easily. The proposed monitoring architecture and related tools have been integrated into a real Cloud deployment based on the OpenStack platform: they are openly available for the research community and include a Web-based customizable Cloud monitoring console. We report experimental results to assess our architecture and quantitatively compare it with a selection of other Cloud monitoring systems similar to ours showing that DARGOS introduces a very limited and scalable monitoring overhead.",

abstract = "In many areas, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has made the decisive steps from prototyping to true manufacturing technology. AM processes excel based on aspects like outstanding geometrical flexibility and lack of tooling, which allows significant lead time reductions both in initial product design and in case of design adaptations. However, in production today, most of these advantages are realized based on homogeneous materials. Attempts at advancing the state of the art address the topic of material combinations and functionally graded materials. The challenges faced by such approaches differ in their level of severity, and are influenced in this respect by the actual AM process chosen. Beyond composites with spatially varying properties, the next level of complexity is the integration of geometrically defined 3D structures within the volume of a part, and specifically functional structures at that. Endeavours of the latter kind are currently receiving increased attention under headlines like “Structural Electronics” or “3D Electronics Printing”. Here, the surface or volume integrated structure typically is a sensor or electronic system. Beyond this system, the AM process then either provides a complex 3D substrate and thus addresses the packaging issue and/or replaces a conventional PCB, or it generates an engineering component directly and closely integrates it with electronic and sensor systems. So far, the backbone of most solutions realized have been hybrid production systems that integrate different manufacturing processes in a single piece of equipment. The present work provides a brief introduction to the various AM techniques and discusses a disambiguation based on their general capability of producing functional structures on a volume integration level. A classification of such structures is suggested that accounts for their level of complexity in relation to the typical, layer-wise manufacturing scheme adopted in AM. Examples stemming from a global research landscape are discussed in the context of this classification. In this, two special foci are selected reflecting related activities at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials (Fraunhofer IFAM): One of these is a combination of manufacturing processes, with functional printing and other direct write techniques linked to AM processes in a dedicated manufacturing cell. The other addresses integration of pre-fabricated electronic components like RFID systems into metal components produced by means of selective laser melting (SLM).The study closes with an overview of future research trends towards producing components with integrated electronics. In doing so, special emphasis is given to AM techniques that allow for in-process switching of materials and thus have the potential of realizing complex systems not by combination of processes, but within the boundaries of a single process. Also addressed are potential application scenarios that profit specifically from the combination of AM and sensor integration.",

After an analysis of the current and of the new territorial application rules under the data protection legislation, we investigate the consequences of these new rules for research and platforms in four particular situations. We warn and advise the regulator that research platforms and the use of other equipment for the collection and processing of personal data in the Union for research may escape from data protection legislation once the new data protection regulation applies. This is due to the revised territorial application rules in the new regulation. We therefore plead for more reflection and clear terminology and for keeping the criterion of the use of equipment for the territorial application of data protection legislation. Rejecting this criterion may result in considerable better (competitive) positions for non-Union companies and institutions collecting and using personal data collected in the Union for research as compared to Union research organisations.",

abstract = "In January 2017 the Consultative Committee of Convention 108 adopted its Guidelines on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data in a World of Big Data. These are the first guidelines on data protection provided by an international body which specifically address the issues surrounding big data applications. This article examines the main provisions of these Guidelines and highlights the approach adopted by the Consultative Committee, which contextualises the traditional principles of data protection in the big data scenario and also takes into account the challenges of the big data paradigm. The analysis of the different provisions adopted focuses primarily on the core of the Guidelines namely the risk assessment procedure. Moreover, the article discusses the novel solutions provided by the Guidelines with regard to the data subject's informed consent, the by-design approach, anonymization, and the role of the human factor in big data-supported decisions. This critical analysis of the Guidelines introduces a broader reflection on the divergent approaches of the Council of Europe and the European Union to regulating data processing. Where the principle-based model of the Council of Europe differs from the approach adopted by the EU legislator in the detailed Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the light of this, the provisions of the Guidelines and their attempt to address the major challenges of the new big data paradigm set the stage for concluding remarks about the most suitable regulatory model to deal with the different issues posed by the development of technology.",

abstract = "The exponential growth in the demands of users to access various resources during mobility has led to the popularity of Vehicular Mobile Cloud. Vehicular users may access various resources on road from the cloud which acts as a service provider for them. Most of the existing proposals on vehicular cloud use unicast sender-based data forwarding, which results in an overall performance degradation with respect to the metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and reliable data transmission. Most of the applications for vehicular cloud have tight upper bounds with respect to reliable transmission. In view of the above, in this paper, we formulate the problem of reliable data forwarding as a Bayesian Coalition Game (BCG) using Learning Automata concepts. Learning Automata (LA) are assumed as the players in the game stationed on the vehicles. For taking adaptive decisions about reliable data forwarding, each player observes the moves of the other players in the game. For this purpose, a coalition game is formulated among the players of the game for taking adaptive decisions. For each action taken by a player in the game, it gets a reward or a penalty from the environment, and accordingly, it updates its action probability vector. An adaptive Learning Automata based Contention Aware Data Forwarding (LACADF) is also proposed. The proposed scheme is evaluated in different network scenarios with respect to parameters such as message overhead, throughput, and delay by varying the density and mobility of the vehicles. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is better than the other conventional schemes with respect to the above metrics.",

This paper contributes a survey based on main energy efficiency techniques. The techniques proposed by researchers are classified according to the ISO communication model and into five different main domains those are radio optimization, data reduction, sleep/wake up schemes and battery repletion domains. Energy efficient algorithms are compared and analyzed on the basis of their proposed solution, claimed and plotted the achieved energy saving and on the applicable area on which they aim to target. Proprietary techniques developed specifically for achieving energy efficiency in Machine-Type Communication (MTC) are also explored in this paper.

abstract = "A nanonetwork is comprised of nanoscale sensors and communicating devices facilitating communication at the nanoscale, which is a promising technology for application in health applications such as intra-body health monitoring and drug delivery. However, the communication performance within a nanonetwork is substantially limited by the energy loss as the Electromagnetic (EM) wave propagates along the channel. Energy harvesting for nanosensor networks can provide a way to overcome the energy bottleneck without considering the lifetime of batteries. Moreover, relaying protocols for nanoscale communications have been proposed to improve the communication performance and extend the transmission distances among nanosensors within nanonetworks. The combination of energy harvesting and a relaying protocol provides an emerging solution not only to overcome the aforementioned energy issues but also enhance the system performance. Therefore, in this paper, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer nanonetworks in the Terahertz (THz) Band (0.1-10 THz) is proposed. An amplify and forward (AF) relaying nanonetwork in this band is investigated, where the relay harvests energy from the received THz signal which is then consumed to forward the information to the destination. Performance based on both time-switching and power-splitting protocols is analyzed. The numerical results show the optimal power-splitting ratio and time switching ratio that achieves the maximum throughput at the destination as well as the impact of transmission distance on system performance. It is seen that the power-splitting protocol gives greater throughput than that of the time-switching protocol.",

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 – What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 – What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline.",

abstract = "Over the recent years, the usage of semantic web technologies has notably increased in the domains of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures.",

Requirement analysis is a key software engineering task in the whole lifecycle of applications; however, the requirements for monitoring systems within edge computing scenarios are not yet fully established. The goal of the present survey study is therefore threefold: to identify the main challenges in the field of monitoring edge computing applications that are as yet not fully solved; to present a new taxonomy of monitoring requirements for adaptive applications orchestrated upon edge computing frameworks; and to discuss and compare the use of widely-used cloud monitoring technologies to assure the performance of these applications.

FaDIS is designed to operate both as an add-on component to existing centralized solutions (complete or otherwise) and as an integral yet independent component of decentralized, scalable, and expandable solutions. Accordingly, FaDIS was implemented in two parts. Part 1 was developed as a scaled proof-of-concept that served as the foundation for Part 2, which is the principal focus of the paper. In Part 2, FaDIS is developed as a fully operational, real-scale system that uses a self-healing mesh network protocol, where its own BeagleBone Black development platform serves as the sink node, and where two Class 2M 10° line lasers are used in conjunction with light dependent resistors to gauge the probabilities of an emergency event based on the estimated dimensions of the collapsed object. In both parts, if FaDIS construes the probabilities of an emergency event as high, the same series of corresponding robotic response-actions intervene locally while automated notifications are sent to emergency-personnel, care-takers, and/or family members via both wireless and cellular technologies. A series of sample runs are detailed and described in the present work in order to demonstrate and to argue for the feasibility and functionality of FaDIS as both a Fall-Detection and -Intervention System in particular and as a WSN-based system in general.",

We focus on verifying user-defined functional properties describing safety rules that programs should obey in order to interact correctly with the hardware. Our analysis is sound by construction and can prove that all possible execution paths follow the correct interaction patterns specified by the functional property. The soundness of the analysis is justified with respect to a preemptive execution model where interrupts can occur during execution depending on the configuration of specific hardware registers. The proposed solution performs a modular analysis that analyzes every interrupt independently and aggregates their results to over-approximate the effect of preemption. By doing so, we avoid reanalyzing interrupts in every context where they are enabled which improves considerably the scalability of the solution. A number of partitioning techniques are also presented in order to track precisely some crucial information, such as the hardware state and the tasks queue. We have performed several experiments on real-world TinyOS device drivers of the ATmega128 MCU and promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis.",

The more technology advances, the more difficult it is to control its privacy intrusive use. This paper argues that there are a number of difficulties posed by such use concerning the respect of one's privacy. The meaning of ‘public security’ is not entirely clear and there are various laws which authorise the invasion of privacy for public security reasons. Technology is developing at such a fast pace and in a more diffused manner without taking on board its privacy implications whilst technological privacy enhancement mechanisms are not catching up. The law of privacy is not sufficiently elaborate and is slow in coming to terms to deal with these novel situations posed by rapid technological advances. The paper thus develops universally legally binding minimum core principles that could be applied indiscriminately to all privacy intrusive technology.",

abstract = "Trust evaluation computes trust values by collecting and processing trust evidence. It plays an important role in trust management that automatically ensures trust relationships among system entities and enhances system security. But trust evidence collection and process may cause privacy leakage, which makes involved entities reluctant to provide personal evidence that is essential for trust evaluation. Current literature pays little attention to Privacy-Preserving Trust Evaluation (PPTE). Existing work still has many limitations, especially on generality, efficiency and reliability. In this paper, we propose two practical schemes to guard privacy of trust evidence providers based on additive homomorphic encryption in order to support a traditional class of trust evaluation that contains evidence summation. The first scheme achieves better computational efficiency, while the second one provides greater security at the expense of a higher computational cost. Accordingly, two trust evaluation algorithms are further proposed to flexibly support different application cases. Specifically, these algorithms can overcome attacks raised by internal malicious evidence providers to some extent even though the trust evaluation is partially performed in an encrypted form. Extensive analysis and performance evaluation show the security and effectivity of our schemes for potential application prospect and their efficiency to support big data process.",

Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately.

In addition, neither does the mobile entity need a care-of address during the mobility process, nor is involved in the mobile handoff process, which reduces the mobile entity’s power consumption and prolongs its life span.

EmbJXTAChord provides for several interesting properties, such as, distributed and fault-tolerant resource discovery, transparent routing over subnetworks, application protocol independence from the transport protocol in narrowband Wireless Sensor Networks, thus eliminating the need for using dedicated software or configuring custom gateways to achieve these functionalities. Moreover, EmbJXTAChord offers native support not only for TCP/HTTP, but also for Bluetooth RFCOMM and 6LoWPAN, thus opening to a broad range of IoT devices in supernetworks composed of networks using different interconnection technologies, not necessarily IP-based. In addition, EmbJXTAChord offers security over heterogeneous networks providing support for secure peergroups (even nested) and for group encryption, thus allowing for unicast and multicast communication between groups of objects sharing the same resources. The users of the proposed architecture will benefit from an integrated solution and the applications developed on the proposed framework will be able to reconfigure themselves, adapting automatically to the network topology of the execution environment. Finally, EmbJXTAChord provides jxCOAP-E, a new CoAP implementation that leverages on the transport mechanisms for heterogeneous networks offered by EmbJXTAChord. jxCOAP-E enables to realize a RESTful service architecture for peer-to-peer narrowband or broadband networks composed of devices connected via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE or IEEE 802.15.4. Differently from CoAP, jxCOAP-E provides a distributed and fault-tolerant service discovery mechanism and support for secure multicast communications. The paper presents EmbJXTAChord, discusses all the relevant design challenges and presents a comparative experimental performance assessment with state-of-the-art solutions on commercial-off-the-shelf devices.",

abstract = "Context Unpredictability and uncertainty about future evolutions of both the system and its environment may easily compromise the behavior of the system. The subsequent software failures can have serious consequences. When dealing with open environments, run-time monitoring is one of the most promising techniques to detect software failures. Several monitoring approaches have been proposed in the last years; however, they suffer from two main limitations. First, they provide limited information to be exploited at run-time for early detecting and managing situations that most probably will lead to failures. Second, they mainly rely on logic-based specifications, whose intrinsic complexity may hamper the use of these monitoring approaches in industrial contexts. Objective In order to address these two limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach, called PREDIMO (PREDIctive MOnitoring). The approach starts from scenario-based specifications, automatically generates predictive monitors called MAs (Multi-valued Automata), which take into account the actual status and also the possible evolution of both system and environment in the near future, and enables the definition of precise strategies to prevent failures. More specifically, the generated monitors evaluate the specified properties and return one of the seven different values representing the degree of controllability of the system and the distance of the potential incoming failure. The translation from scenario-based specifications to MAs preserves the semantics of the starting specification. Method We use the design and creation research methodology to design an innovative approach that fills highlighted gaps of state-of-the-art approaches. The validation of the approach is performed through a large experimentation with OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) applications. Results We present a novel language to specify the properties to be monitored. Then, we present a novel approach to automatically generate predictive monitors from the specified properties. Conclusions The overall approach is tool supported and a large experimentation demonstrates its feasibility and usability.",

In WSNs, congestion is caused by the following factors: packet collision, node buffer overflow, transmission channel contention, transmission rate, many-to-one data transmission scheme and dynamic time variation transmission channel. Indeed, congestion has a significant impact on Quality of Services (QoS) parameters such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption in wireless nodes. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of major congestion control mechanisms used in WSNs and classifies the available methods into four categories i.e. traffic control protocols, resource control protocols, queue assisted protocols and priority-aware protocols. This review paper compares the important techniques with each other in terms of congestion detection, congestion notification and congestion mitigation as well as directions for future researches and works.",

To achieve this goal, sensor protocols often aggregate measured data from multiple sensor nodes into a single packet. In this paper, a survey of aggregation techniques and methods is given. Based on this survey, it is concluded that there are currently several dependencies between the aggregation method and the behavior of the other network layers. As a result, existing aggregation methods can often not be combined with different routing protocols. To remedy this shortcoming, the paper introduces a new ‘non-intrusive’ aggregation approach which is independent of the routing protocol. The proposed aggregation method is evaluated and compared to traditional aggregation approaches using a large-scale sensor testbed of 200 TMoteSky sensor nodes. Our experimental results indicate that existing aggregation approaches are only suited for a limited set of network scenarios. In addition, it is shown both mathematically and experimentally that our approach outperforms existing non-intrusive techniques in a wide range of scenarios.",

abstract = "Tracing items in a supply chain, across different enterprises and through the full processes scope, is today an inherently complex design task. Enterprises are typically comprised of hundreds of applications that are custom built at different times, acquired from third parties and parts of legacy systems, and also operating in multiple tiers of different manufacturing and information system platforms. Further, traceability is characterized by a goal-oriented approach, in which business-process analyses are driven by goal achievements rather than by systematic engineering processes. The use of a classical enterprise integration approach mostly needs tailoring to different applications. Due to the number and diversity of the systems and of their interactions, and to their dynamicity, it is difficult, costly, and therefore often not convenient to develop in large scale distributed systems. To overcome these issues, a supply chain traceability system with a high level of automation is discussed in this paper. In particular, the system adopts an agent-based approach, in which cooperative software agents find solutions to back-end tracing problems by self-organization. Such cooperative agents are based on a business process aware traceability model, and on a service-oriented composition paradigm. Furthermore, an interface agent assists each user to carry out the front-end tracking activities. Interface agents rely on the context-awareness paradigm to gain self-configurability and self-adaptation of the user interface, and on ubiquitous computing technology, i.e., mobile devices and radio-frequency identification, to perform agile and automatic lot identification. The paper comprises real-world experiences on the fashion supply chain.",

Despite their enormous potential, they are currently mostly used only to monitor single individuals. Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals. In this paper, C-SPINE, a framework for Collaborative BSNs (CBSNs), is proposed. CBSNs are BSNs able to collaborate with each other to fulfill a common goal. They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Specifically, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-specific protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as filtering, time-dependent data integration and classification. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multi-sensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals’ meeting.",

abstract = "In the past decade, rapid technological advances in the fields of electronics and telecommunications have given rise to versatile, ubiquitous decentralized embedded sensor systems with ad hoc wireless networking capabilities. Typically these systems are used to gather large amounts of data, while the detection of anomalies (such as system failures, intrusion, or unanticipated behavior of the environment) in the data (or other types or processing) is performed in centralized computer systems. In spite of the great interest that it attracts, the systematic porting and analysis of centralized anomaly detection algorithms to a decentralized paradigm (compatible with the aforementioned sensor systems) has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. We approach this task from a new angle, assessing the viability of localized (in-node) anomaly detection based on machine learning. The main challenges we address are: (1) deploying decentralized, automated, online learning, anomaly detection algorithms within the stringent constraints of typical embedded systems; and (2) evaluating the performance of such algorithms and comparing them with that of centralized ones. To this end, we first analyze (and port) single and multi-dimensional input classifiers that are trained incrementally online and whose computational requirements are compatible with the limitations of embedded platforms. Next, we combine multiple classifiers in a single online ensemble. Then, using both synthetic and real-world datasets from different application domains, we extensively evaluate the anomaly detection performance of our algorithms and ensemble, in terms of precision and recall, and compare it to that of well-known offline, centralized machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the ensemble performs better than each individual decentralized classifier and that it can match the performance of the offline alternatives, thus showing that our approach is a viable solution to detect anomalies, even in environments with little a priori knowledge.",

Vibration energy harvesting and sensing is a traditional and growing research field in which various working mechanisms and designs have been developed for an improved performance. Relying on a coupling effect of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, in the past 5 years, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been applied as a fundamentally new technology to revive the field of vibration energy harvesting and self-powered sensing, especially for low-frequency vibrations such as human motion, automobile, machine, and bridge vibrations. The demonstrated instantaneous energy conversion efficiency of ∼70% and a total efficiency up to 85% distinguished TENG from traditional techniques. In this article, both TENG-enabled vibration energy harvesting and self-powered active sensing are comprehensively reviewed. Moving toward future development, problems pressing for solutions and onward research directions are also posed to deliver a coherent picture.",

abstract = "Evaluating end-to-end systems is uniquely challenging in industrial/commercial printing due to a large number of equipment combinations and customization needed for each customer and application. Moreover any mismatch in capacities may render multi-million dollar investments to zero returns on investment. Simulation can help foresee changes on the shop floor when demand changes. Providing a library of components that can be assembled together is the usual approach used by many simulation vendors which still leaves a simulation engineer in the loop to make it usable. We detail our experiences on implementing a prototype (private) cloud service using service broker architecture and a dynamic model generator. The service broker handles the heterogeneity associated with demand and equipment configurations whereas the dynamic model generator customizes a generic model based on inputs from the user. This helps avoiding rewiring of simulation models on each engagement. The schema and the necessary front and back-end codes all reside in the cloud and, therefore, users pay on a per use basis without worrying about the upgrade/update of software at their end. The service supports multi-tenancy which results in low costs per user and provides sharing of resource information yet restricting access to proprietary workflows and policies. A typical run costs a very small amount, which is affordable for even small-sized PSPs. We show the utility of our work in the context of educational book publishing to evaluate equipment changes needed when the current lumpy order demand stream changes to a highly fragmented demand stream. We also discuss how our work can be extended to several other domains such healthcare, transportation, 3D printing.",

However, the different solutions presented in this survey are not only intended to mechanisms dedicated to fault tolerance, but they also include all the mechanisms allowing the prevention of fault occurrence such as energy aware routing and data aggregation and compression. Besides the classification of fault tolerance mechanisms according to the tasks they target (data management, flow management), we also propose a new classification based on the network size, since the performance of the majority mechanisms depends on the size in terms of geographical area and number of nodes.

In many cases, cloud resources are used for such processing, exploiting their flexibility, but these sensor streaming applications often need to support operational and control actions that have real-time and low-latency requirements that go beyond the cost effective and flexible solutions supported by existing cloud frameworks, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, or Map-Reduce Streams. In this paper, we describe a model-driven and stepwise refinement methodological approach for streaming applications executed over clouds. The central role is assigned to a set of Petri Net models for specifying functional and non-functional requirements. They support model reuse, and a way to combine formal analysis, simulation, and approximate computation of minimal and maximal boundaries of non-functional requirements when the problem is either mathematically or computationally intractable. We show how our proposal can assist developers in their design and implementation decisions from a performance perspective. Our methodology allows to conduct performance analysis: The methodology is intended for all the engineering process stages, and we can (i) analyse how it can be mapped onto cloud resources, and (ii) obtain key performance indicators, including throughput or economic cost, so that developers are assisted in their development tasks and in their decision taking.

Three large-scale performance tests are conducted to reveal the contributions of gender, age, educational level of attainment, Internet experience, and amount of Internet use on both medium- and content-related Internet skills. Age appears to have a negative influence on medium-related skills. However, there is a positive contribution to the level of content-related skills, meaning that older generations perform better than the younger. Unfortunately, they are impeded by their low level of medium-related skills in such a way that the actual result is negative. This noteworthy conclusion, to our knowledge, has hardly received any attention in digital divide research. Educational attainment appears significant for both medium- and content-related Internet skills. This conclusion contrasts somewhat with other research that claims that people learn digital skills more in practice than in formal educational settings. Internet experience only contributes to medium-related skills. It appears that content-related skills do not grow with years of Internet experience and the number of hours spent online weekly. The latter only has some effect on medium-related skills.",

In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons.",

The problem involves minimizing transportation cost, incompatibility and number of customers visited twice. A solution method based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed for solving the VRPSPD. The pickup uncertainty is handled in two stages: first, a priori routes are generated by solving a VRPSPD whose pickup demands are estimated; second, the a priori routes are simulated by dynamically satisfying the pickup demand under incompatibility, and the second-round routes are generated to meet the unmet demands. The effects of considering the incompatibility are examined by experiments. A case of centralized tableware disinfection and logistics services in China’s catering industry is used for demonstration. Disinfected tableware for delivery and used tableware for pickup are incompatible because of potential cross-contamination. The experimental results quantitatively provide insights for managers who must solve the dynamic closed-loop VRP with uncertain pickup and incompatible goods. The proposed method also proves competitive for the VRPSPD.",

abstract = "Urban microclimate studies are gaining popularity due to rapid urbanization. Many studies documented that urban microclimate can affect building energy performance, human morbidity and mortality and thermal comfort. Historically, urban microclimate studies were conducted with observational methods such as field measurements. In the last decades, with the advances in computational resources, numerical simulation approaches have become increasingly popular. Nowadays, especially simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is frequently used to assess urban microclimate. CFD can resolve the transfer of heat and mass and their interaction with individual obstacles such as buildings. Considering the rapid increase in CFD studies of urban microclimate, this paper provides a review of research reported in journal publications on this topic till the end of 2015. The studies are categorized based on the following characteristics: morphology of the urban area (generic versus real) and methodology (with or without validation study). In addition, the studies are categorized by specifying the considered urban settings/locations, simulation equations and models, target parameters and keywords. This review documents the increasing popularity of the research area over the years. Based on the data obtained concerning the urban location, target parameters and keywords, the historical development of the studies is discussed and future perspectives are provided. According to the results, early CFD microclimate studies were conducted for model development and later studies considered CFD approach as a predictive methodology. Later, with the established simulation setups, research efforts shifted to case studies. Recently, an increasing amount of studies focus on urban scale adaptation measures. The review hints a possible change in this trend as the results from CFD simulations can be linked up with different aspects (e.g. economy) and with different scales (e.g. buildings), and thus, CFD can play an important role in transferring urban climate knowledge into engineering and design practice.",

abstract = "Today, a paradigm shift is being observed in science, where the focus is gradually shifting away from operation to data, which is greatly influencing the decision making also. The data is being inundated proactively from several sources in various forms; especially social media and in modern data science vocabulary is being recognized as Big Data. Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the growing role of cloud computing in Big Data ecosystem. Also, we propose a novel XCLOUDX {XCloudX, X…X}classification to zoom in to gauge the intuitiveness of the scientific name of the cloud-assisted NoSQL Big Data models and analyze whether XCloudX always uses cloud computing underneath or vice versa. XCloudX symbolizes those NoSQL Big Data models that embody the term “cloud” in their name, where X is any alphanumeric variable. The discussion is strengthen by a set of important case studies. Furthermore, we study the emergence of as-a-Service era, motivated by cloud computing drive and explore the new members beyond traditional cloud computing stack, developed in the past couple of years.",

abstract = "This paper presents a fundus image analysis based computer aided system for automatic classification and grading of cataract, which provides great potentials to reduce the burden of well-experienced ophthalmologists (the scarce resources) and help cataract patients in under-developed areas to know timely their cataract conditions and obtain treatment suggestions from doctors. The system is composed of fundus image pre-processing, image feature extraction, and automatic cataract classification and grading. The wavelet transform and the sketch based methods are investigated to extract from fundus image the features suitable for cataract classification and grading. After feature extraction, a multiclass discriminant analysis algorithm is used for cataract classification, including two-class (cataract or non-cataract) classification and cataract grading in mild, moderate, and severe. A real-world dataset, including fundus image samples with mild, moderate, and severe cataract, is used for training and testing. The preliminary results show that, for the wavelet transform based method, the correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 90.9% and 77.1%, respectively. The correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 86.1% and 74.0% for the sketch based method, which is comparable to the wavelet transform based method. The pilot study demonstrates that our research on fundus image analysis for cataract classification and grading is very helpful for improving the efficiency of fundus image review and ophthalmic healthcare quality. We believe that this work can serve as an important reference for the development of similar health information system to solve other medical diagnosis problems.",

abstract = "Cloud providers commonly incur heavy upfront set up costs which remain almost constant whether they serve a single or many customers. In order to generate a return on this investment, a suitable pricing strategy is required by providers. Established industries such as the airlines employ dynamic pricing to maximize their revenues. In order to increase their resource utilization rates, cloud providers could also use dynamic pricing for their services. At present however most providers use static schemes for pricing their resources. This work presents a new dynamic pricing mechanism for cloud providers. Furthermore, at present no platform exists that provides a dynamic unified view of the different cloud offerings in real-time. Due to a rapidly changing landscape and a limited knowledge of the cloud marketplace, consumers can often end up choosing a cloud provider that is more expensive or does not give them what they really need. This is because some providers spend significantly on advertising their services online. In order to assist cloud customers in the selection of a suitable resource and cloud providers in implementing dynamic pricing, this work describes an automated dynamic pricing marketplace and a decision support system for cloud users. We present a multi-agent multi-auction based system through which such services are delivered. An evaluation has been carried out to determine how effectively the Cloud Market Maker selects the resource, dynamically adjusts the price for the cloud users and the suitability of dynamic pricing for the cloud environment.",

Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements. Research, technology, and policy recommendations are also outlined.",

abstract = "We define personal risk detection as the timely identification of when someone is in the midst of a dangerous situation, for example, a health crisis or a car accident, events that may jeopardize a person’s physical integrity. We work under the hypothesis that a risk-prone situation produces sudden and significant deviations in standard physiological and behavioural user patterns. These changes can be captured by a group of sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate. We introduce a dataset, called PRIDE, which provides a baseline for the development and the fair comparison of personal risk detection mechanisms. PRIDE contains information on 18 test subjects; for each subject, it includes partial information about the user’s behavioural and physiological patterns, as captured by Microsoft Band©. PRIDE test subject records include sensor readings of not only when a subject is carrying out ordinary daily life activities, but also when exposed to a stressful scenario, thereby simulating a dangerous or abnormal situation. We show how to use PRIDE to develop a personal risk detection mechanism; to accomplish this, we have tackled risk detection as a one-class classification problem. We have trained several classifiers based only on the daily behaviour of test subjects. Further, we tested the accuracy of the classifiers to detect anomalies that were not included in the training process of the classifiers. We used a number of one-class classifiers, namely: SVM, Parzen, and two versions of Parzen based on k-means. While there is still room for improvement, our results are encouraging: they support our hypothesis that abnormal behaviour can be automatically detected.",

There are many challenges such as security, privacy, ease of configuration, incompatible legacy devices, a wealth of wireless standards, limited resources of embedded systems, etc. Taking these challenges into account, we present a Trusted Domain home automation platform, which dynamically and securely connects heterogeneous networks of Short-Range Wireless devices via simple non-expert user interactions, and allows remote access via IP-based devices such as smartphones. The Trusted Domain platform fits existing legacy technologies by managing their interoperability and access controls, and it seeks to avoid the security issues of relying on third-party servers outside the home. It is a distributed system that enables secure end-to-end communication with home automation devices, and it supports device revocations as well as a structure of intersecting sets of nodes for scalability. Devices in the Trusted Domain are registered in a list that is distributed using a robust epidemic protocol optimized for constrained resources and network load sharing. The resource-intensive encryption operations are reduced to a minimum by sending short signed update queries and only synchronizing when necessary. An experiment on an embedded implementation examines timing, footprint, and behavioral properties of the protocol. The protocol has been formally verified by the UPPAAL model-checking tool.",

With its responsibility of serving consumers with food that is safe, readily available, affordable and of the quality and diversity consumers expect, the food sector needs to be efficient, to build on an appropriate organization and control of processes, and to provide assurance on the safety and quality of its products which consumers could trust. Efficiency, process control and consumer communications are all closely related to the use of information and communication technology (ICT). Global networks, the internet, networked devices, sensors, and communication intelligence are of foremost relevance for the sustainability of the food sector in meeting its responsibility. This paper provides an overview on the state-of-the-art in three use cases within the application domain of the food sector. The three use cases capture the flow of food products from agriculture (use case ‘agriculture’) through the food industry (use case ‘agri-food logistics’) to the consumer as the final customer (use case ‘food awareness’). In dealing with the state-of-the-art the paper has to focus on the major research and application domains that are of relevance in assuring the successful utilization of the potential of the future internet for reaching a concept for the organization of the use cases that has the potential for major improvements in coordination and communication activities along the chain but also for large scale adoption throughout the sector.",

Although bringing extended autonomy to battery powered stations, such technologies are known to be negatively influenced by similar technologies contending for the medium and, especially, by technologies using higher power transmissions over the same frequency bands. A frequency band that is becoming increasingly crowded with competing technologies is the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical band, encompassing, for example, Bluetooth and ZigBee, two low-power communication standards which are the base of several real-time protocols. Although these technologies employ mechanisms to improve their coexistence, they are still vulnerable to transmissions from uncoordinated stations with similar technologies or to higher power technologies such as Wi- Fi, which hinders the support of wireless dependable real-time communications in open environments. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the most commonly used wireless low-power technologies operating in the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and real-time protocols built upon them. The survey of the real-time protocols using these technologies is focused on factory automation applications, due to their more demanding timeliness and reliability requirements.",

abstract = "Timing is a key issue in many wireless, lower-layer (e.g., physical and data link layer) communication protocols. Maintaining time-critical behavior while increasing MAC protocol complexity is the challenge for many MAC implementations. To comply with stringent time constraints, current MAC implementations typically require such a tight integration to the radio driver that they become one monolithic block of code with MAC-specific logic hard coded at the lowest firmware level. Execution of time-critical functions in the firmware is a good strategy, but results in limited flexibility for MAC designers because the radio driver is dedicated for specific MAC protocol logic. We propose “snapMac”: a generic MAC/PHY architecture with a clean separation between the MAC protocol logic at the user level and the execution at the radio firmware level (Patent Pending). Our generic programming interface enables more flexibility, an easy way to compose new MAC designs, and getting feedback from the radio capabilities We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this architecture by implementing it on a resource-constrained wireless sensor node. The experimental evaluation shows, for example, that we can simultaneously keep the flexibility of a software ACK and meet the ACK timing constraints as specified in the 802.15.4 standard. We also achieve 97% (i.e., 218kbit/s) of the theoretical 802.15.4 throughput. This new implementation approach for MAC/PHY interactions has potential to be applied in other domains (e.g., WiFi, software defined radio, cognitive radio, etc.). Demonstrating the portability of snapMac is future work. “snapMac” enables the design and execution of new MAC protocols in a snap.",

Depending on the optimization goal and constraints, a great number of these problems are solved using Linear Programming (LP) techniques whenever possible or the network model is further simplified to fit into this category, albeit accuracy may be degraded. In many other cases, simplifying the network model is not feasible and optimization requires more complex techniques. For these cases, non-linear optimization becomes an interesting alternative. Non-linear optimization is beneficial provided that more accurate results are needed or linear optimization is not achievable or yields unreliable results. This paper surveys recent and significant contributions regarding non-linear optimization problems in WSN, selecting the most relevant objectives to optimize and classify the problems under consideration into several categories. Furthermore, this work provides insights in many important problems requiring non-linear optimization and, finally, discusses current open questions in this area.",

See the report TIRO, Teens and ICT: Risks and Opportunities (Cyberteens and cybertools), published by BELSPO, 2008. aims both at introducing the legal aspects of the protection of minors in cyberspace and analysing and criticizing certain main features embedded in this legal approach of young people protection. After a short introduction underlining the concept of child’s rights and the reason why this right has been particularly proclaimed in the context of the cyberspace, the first section describes the new technological features of the ICT environment and linked to this evolution the increasing risks the minors are confronted with. A typology of cyber abuses is proposed on the basis of these considerations. A list of EU or Council of Europe texts directly or indirectly related to the minors’ protection into the cyberspace is provided. The second section intends to analyse certain characteristics of the legal approach as regards the ways by which that protection is conceived and effectively ensured. Different principles and methods might be considered as keywords summarizing the legal approach and to a certain extent, fixing a partition of responsibilities taking fully into account the diversity of actors might be deduced from the different regulatory documents. The third section comes back to the different complementary means by which the Law is envisaging the minors’ protection. The obligation to create awareness about the potential risks minors might incur definitively is the first one. The omnipresent reference in all the legal texts to the role of self-regulatory interventions constitutes another pillar of the protection envisaged by the Law. After having described the multiple instruments developed in the context of this self-regulation (labels, codes of conduct, hotlines, ODR…) or even co-regulation, the paper examines the conditions set by the European legislators as regards these instruments. Technology might be considered as a fourth method for protecting children. Our concern will be to see how the Law is addressing new requirements as regards the technological solutions and their implementation. The present debates about the liability of the actors involved in applications or services targeted or not vis-à-vis the minors like SNS or VSP operators are evoked. As a final point the question of the increasing competences of LEA and the reinforcement of the criminal provisions in order to fight cyber abuses against minors will be debated. In conclusion, we will address final recommendations about the way by which it would be possible to reconcile effective minors’ protection and liberties into the cyberspace.",

abstract = "Situated within science of science, this study analyzes the nature, practice, and impact of ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability as a form of science and technology (S&T) within the defining context of smart sustainable cities. Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.",

However, these tools are designed as separate stand-alone applications. To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools, we have designed a new extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and open-source framework called PROVIZ. PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming framework with the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization tool that can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packet payload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packet sniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF 802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) a scripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aims at reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) an over-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) a visual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules for generating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison tool that analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposed visual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ also includes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities that allow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with other users. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ’s visualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, and discuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to create an all-encompassing development and test environment.",

abstract = "Information about millions of people is collected for behavioural targeting, a type of marketing that involves tracking people's online behaviour for targeted advertising. It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.",

In various mobile application scenarios, online semantic data has proven to be useful. While query endpoints are most commonly exploited, they are mainly useful to expose large semantic datasets. Alternatively, mobile RDF stores are utilized to query local semantic data, but this requires the design-time identification and replication of relevant data. Instead, we present a mobile query service that supports on-the-fly and integrated querying of semantic data, originating from a largely unused portion of the Semantic Web, comprising online RDF files and semantics embedded in annotated webpages. To that end, our solution performs dynamic identification, retrieval and caching of query-relevant semantic data. We explore several data identification and caching alternatives, and investigate the utility of source metadata in optimizing these tasks. Further, we introduce a novel cache replacement strategy, fine-tuned to the described query dataset, and include explicit support for the Open World Assumption. An extensive experimental validation evaluates the query service and its alternative components.",

This model of client–server data communication has evolved into a peer-to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times. Applications like, YouTube, Bit Torrent, social networks have revolutionized the idea of user generated contents. Modern users care only for specific data items irrespective of their sources. So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth.

Radio Frequency Identification or simply RFID has become an integral part of modern computing. RFID is notable in that it is the first practical technology to tightly couple physical entities and digital information. In this survey, we cater to the computing professional who is not familiar with the specifics of RFID, which we discuss in the context of supply chain management, its most popular application. We begin with a primer on supply chains, with particular reference to the relationship between efficiency and information flow. We recognize universal identification with bar codes and electronic data interchange as the two principle computing technologies that have played a central role in the optimization of supply chains. We then discuss RFID and supporting network technologies and identify their novel features and capabilities. We proceed by examining the performance improvements in supply chain management due to RFID and differentiate between different levels of tagging. We explore consumer applications and services using item-level RFID in particular. Such applications not only offer novel opportunities for business but also raise important social and policy challenges primarily related to privacy protection, which we discuss in more detail. We conclude by exploring how European law is attempting to address the new issues arising from the use of RFID and look ahead at the challenges encountered when computing with RFID before it can be made an effective end-user technology.",

To meet these research challenges, we propose a novel TOP-N Gene-based Collaborative Filtering (GeneCF) algorithm based on Gi of patients. The GeneCF algorithm is aimed for matching more accurate recommendations about genes to the patients, with exceptional precision and coverage achieved. The GeneCF algorithm has been tested and evaluated on a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) gene expression database.

abstract = "Recently, with the fast proliferation of smart phones, mobile phone has the powerful ability of not only communication but also computation. Human beings are not only data consumers, but data producer with their objective or subjective sensing needs. Mobile crowd sensing is an emerging computing paradigm that tasks everyday mobile devices to form participatory sensor networks. It allows the increasing number of mobile phone users to share local knowledge acquired by their sensor-enhanced devices. Social sensors, social sensor receiver platform, and mobile crowd sensing paradigm compose a process by which physical sensors present in mobile devices such as GPS are used to infer social relationships and human activities. In this survey, we review the mobile crowd sensing applications on social sensors based on social sensor receiver platform (e.g., Weibo and Twitter) from three categories: public security, smart city, and location based services. Most applications adopted in current works fit in one of these categories. Existing works on applications of mobile crowd sensing on social sensors are collected and studied. Some possible future directions of potential new application category are proposed and analyzed.",

abstract = "In the area of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), improving energy efficiency and network lifetime is one of the most important and challenging issues. Most of the considered WSNs are formed by nodes with limited resources, in which each node plays dual rule of both sensing the environment and relaying traffic to the sink from other nodes. On the one hand, the nodes need to stay alive as long as possible by achieving energy efficiency. On the other hand, they have to provide the required service. This conflict of interest makes game theory very useful in WSNs. Moreover, nodes usually have to make decisions with limited information about the state of the network. Game theory has been used recently in a remarkable amount of research in this area. In this survey, we review the most recent papers about using game theory in WSNs to achieve a trade-off between maximizing the network lifetime and providing the required service. The paper contains a complete taxonomy of games applied to this specific research problem. It summarizes and compares the different published proposals along with tables and statistical charts showing in which domains game theory has been applied recently. Overall, the paper will give to researchers a clear view of the newest trends in this research area, underlining its main challenges and hopefully fostering discussions and new research directions.",

Artificial neural network (ANN) approaches have the ability to solve complex decision-making problems that involve uncertainty and a large amount of information in a fast and reliable way. The application of this evolutionary CI technique to analyze a large amount of data is an important strategy to solve several problems in healthcare management. This paper proposes the modeling, performance evaluation, and comparison analysis of an ANN technique known as the radial basis function network (RBFNetwork) to identify possible cases of gestational diabetes that can lead to multiple risks for both the pregnant women and the fetus. This method achieved promising results with a precision of 0.785, F-measure of 0.786, ROC area of 0.839, and Kappa statistic of 0.5092. These indicators show that this ANN-based approach is an excellent predictor for gestational diabetes mellitus. This research provides a comprehensive decision-making model capable of improving the care provided to women who are at a risk of developing gestational diabetes, which is the most common metabolic problem in gestation with a prevalence of 3–18%. Thus, this work can contribute to the reduction of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity rates.",

Surface characterization offered by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy provide detailed evidences about the effect of the bio-functionalization. The fabricated microfiber sensor is immersed into glucose solutions at different concentrations to record and analyze the transmission spectrums from an optical sensing interrogator. The experimental results demonstrate that the resonant wavelength shift is linearly correlated with the glucose concentration in the range of 0–3.0mg/ml with a response coefficient of 1.74nm/mg−1ml−1.

This paper proposes packet priority intimation-based (PPI) congestion control mechanism. We introduce a PPI bit in each packet to reflect its importance. Main objective of this mechanism is to send higher priority packets with minimum delay. The proposed PPI mechanism is deployed in the existing AODV routing protocol to convert the existing routing protocol to a congestion aware routing protocol.

The peculiarities of the Terahertz Band, which is the envisioned frequency band for communication among nano-devices, and the extreme energy limitations of nanosensors, which require the use of nanoscale energy harvesting systems, introduce major challenges in the design of MAC protocols for WNSNs. This paper aims to design energy and spectrum-aware MAC protocols for WNSNs with the objective to achieve fair, throughput and lifetime optimal channel access by jointly optimizing the energy harvesting and consumption processes in nanosensors. Towards this end, the critical packet transmission ratio (CTR) is derived, which is the maximum allowable ratio between the transmission time and the energy harvesting time, below which a nanosensor can harvest more energy than the consumed one, thus achieving perpetual data transmission. Based on the CTR, first, a novel symbol-compression scheduling algorithm, built on a recently proposed pulse-based physical layer technique, is introduced. The symbol-compression solution utilizes the unique elasticity of the inter-symbol spacing of the pulse-based physical layer to allow a large number of nanosensors to transmit their packets in parallel without inducing collisions. In addition, a packet-level timeline scheduling algorithm, built on a theoretical bandwidth-adaptive capacity-optimal physical layer, is proposed with an objective to achieve balanced single-user throughput with infinite network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed simple scheduling algorithms can enable nanosensors to transmit with extremely high speed perpetually without replacing the batteries.",

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient cyber–physical smart home system for monitoring the elderly that uses the potential of cloud computing and big data technologies. Given that an elderly person may need assistance with the complex activities of maintaining energy efficiency, a smart multimedia-enabled middleware assistant is proposed that enables him/her to observe different energy-efficient processes, control smart home appliances through gestures, receive notifications regarding appliance statuses, and share multimedia messages with a community of interest. For data processing, robust and low-dimensional discriminative features are extracted in a server from the data available via sensors and multimedia. Events are also automatically classified in the server to assist caregiver decision-making. To save energy, an automatic switch on/off control system using speech or gesture is developed. Keywords are detected from the speech and used as control commands. Experimental results show the encouraging potential of deploying this framework at a large scale.",

However, there are some problems in the currently-used measuring instruments. Single-type sensor has limitations to pulse wave acquisition. It is not enough to set three sampling points to detect variation trend of radial artery pulse wave. Adaptation to different wrist surfaces and mutual interference of sensors are neglected. This paper proposes a novel flexible compound pressure sensor array for measuring radial artery pulse wave to overcome the problems mentioned above. Our compound pressure sensor consists of a piezoelectric sensor and a piezoresistive sensor which are used to measure pulse wave and static pressure separately. A bending structure of the sensor could guarantee the signal intensity and prevent the occurrence of inverted waveform. In this study, poroelastic materials are used to achieve flexible connection and decrease interference among sensors. In addition, the amplitude characteristics of pulse wave in radial artery are described and the arrangement and size of the sensor array is designed based on statistical data. Anti-interference, repeatability and validation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the sensor array. The results show that the flexible compound pressure sensor array not only reflects depth information of radial artery pulse wave under a wide range of static pressures, but also has good repeatability and anti-interference performance.",

Several frameworks have been proposed to facilitate service provider selection, however, only very few of them are built on existing cloud standards, and adaptability to different contexts is still a challenge. This paper proposes a new trust framework, called Context-Aware Multifaceted Trust Framework (CAMFT), to assist in evaluating trust in cloud service providers. CAMTF is flexible and context aware: it considers trust factors, users and services. When making recommendations, CAMFT employs a combination of mathematical methods that depend on the type of trust factors, and it takes both service characteristics and user perspective into account.

However, the problem of privacy leakage has become a main factor that hinders the further development of LBS. When a LBS user sends queries to the LBS server, the user’s personal privacy in terms of identity and location may be leaked to the attacker. To protect user’s privacy, Niu et al. proposed an algorithm named enhanced-Dummy Location Selection (en-DLS). In this paper, we introduce two attacks to en-DLS, namely long-term statistical attack (LSA) and regional statistical attack (RSA). In the proposed attacks, an attacker can obtain the privacy contents of a user by analyzing LBS historical data, which causes en-DLS to be invalid for user’s privacy protection. Furthermore, this paper proposes a set of privacy protection schemes against both LSA and RSA. For LSA, we propose two protection methods named multiple user name (MNAME) and same user name (SNAME). To solve the regional privacy issue, we divide the map into various regions with different requirements on privacy protection. For this purpose, four levels of protection requirements (PLs) are defined, and true location is protected by allocating a certain number of positions from the dummies according to the location’s PL. Performance analysis and simulation results show that our proposed methods can completely avoid the vulnerabilities of en-DLS to both LSA and RSA, and incur marginal increase of communication overhead and computational cost.",

Since the patient-related data in the form of text, image, voice, etc. is significant in the process of healthcare services, efficiently managing these media data from various WBAN is vital for various applications. Recently, Cloud-assisted WBAN has become popular that can supply massive computing, flexible storage and various software services to WBAN.

In the network, the integration of TCP/IP and Zigbee in the coordinator devices is utilized. Consequently, WBAN coordinators can compatibility inter-operate with various local networks such as WiFi and LTE network to support high mobility of users. Besides, we integrate Content Centric Networking (CCN) with our proposed architecture to improve the ability of the WBAN coordinator. Thus, it can support uninterrupted media healthcare content delivery. In addition, adaptive streaming technique was also utilized to reduce packet loss. Various simulations were conducted using OPNET simulator to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture in terms of transmitting a huge amount of media healthcare data in real-time under traditional IP-based network.",

abstract = "The discrimination information (DI) of keyword plays an important role in information retrieval and data mining. However, the measurement of DI is still a challenge because the existing methods cannot leverage the contradiction between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, a new model is proposed, does not need any prior knowledge and the computing complexity is O(nm) for a collection of m documents with n keywords. Firstly, we define three types of keywords according to the document frequency spectrum, which divides the spectrum of keywords into two monotonically spectrums that can give a qualitative analysis of DI. Secondly, in order to decrease the complexity, the power law function of keywords’ document frequencies is built. Thirdly, we propose an algorithm to classify keywords by using the distances between the adjacent points on the linear regression line. Finally, a piecewise function is used for computing DI according to the monotonically spectrums, which transforms DI into a scalable value to be used directly, thereby reducing the computing complexity of DI significantly. Moreover, a new weighting scheme of keywords based on DI is employed for document clustering, which shows that DI has a good prospect on the information retrieval area.",

abstract = "Storing and sharing of medical data in the cloud environment, where computing resources including storage is provided by a third party service provider, raise serious concern of individual privacy for the adoption of cloud computing technologies. Existing privacy protection researches can be classified into three categories, i.e., privacy by policy, privacy by statistics, and privacy by cryptography. However, the privacy concerns and data utilization requirements on different parts of the medical data may be quite different. The solution for medical dataset sharing in the cloud should support multiple data accessing paradigms with different privacy strengths. The statistics or cryptography technology alone cannot enforce the multiple privacy demands, which blocks their application in the real-world cloud. This paper proposes a practical solution for privacy preserving medical record sharing for cloud computing. Based on the classification of the attributes of medical records, we use vertical partition of medical dataset to achieve the consideration of different parts of medical data with different privacy concerns. It mainly includes four components, i.e., (1) vertical data partition for medical data publishing, (2) data merging for medical dataset accessing, (3) integrity checking, and (4) hybrid search across plaintext and ciphertext, where the statistical analysis and cryptography are innovatively combined together to provide multiple paradigms of balance between medical data utilization and privacy protection. A prototype system for the large scale medical data access and sharing is implemented. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",

abstract = "In the subject of smart sustainable cities, the underlying theories are a foundation for practice. Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses of high integration, fusion, and applicability potential in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.",

In this paper, we propose a new cloud-enabled and Privacy-preserving sparse representation classification (P2-SRC) system to protect the privacy of both the “data contributors” and “application users” when cloud server is untrusted. Different from the state-of-the-art approaches which only consider the attacks on data values, our proposed system, P2-SRC, addresses multiple types of privacy attacks including Content Privacy Attacks, Source Privacy Attacks and Label Privacy Attacks. As a result, besides the data values, in P2-SRC, the identities and activities of the users are also protected. According to our evaluations on two different classification applications (face recognition and activity recognition), P2-SRC achieves almost the same classification accuracy compared with traditional SRC approach which indicates the security add-ons do not affect the accuracy of the SRC classifier. We also demonstrate that it outperforms the most related work, Pickle, significantly on recognition accuracy and privacy protections. Meanwhile the implementation of P2-SRC in a face recognition application on smartphones demonstrates that P2-SRC based authentication system accounts for only 0.000041% of the total energy supply of a normal smartphone and the average responding time is around 1.1 s for each recognition request.",

Abnormal data, outliers or anomalies are usually considered to be those sensor readings that have deviated significantly from normal behavior. However, the challenge is to ensure data quality, secure monitoring and reliable detection of interesting and critical events.

It makes the medical search technologies become critical to find useful patient information in the large medical dataset. However, the high quality medical search is a challenging task, in particular due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of medical terminology. In this paper, by exploiting the uncertainty in ambiguous medical queries, we propose a novel semantic-based approach to achieve the diversity-aware retrieval of EMRs, i.e., both the relevance and novelty are considered for EMR ranking. With the support of medical domain ontologies, we first mine all the potential semantics (concepts and relations between them) from a user query and consume them to model the multiple query aspects. Then, we propose a novel diversification strategy, which considers not only the aspect importance but also the aspect similarity, to perform the diversity-aware EMR ranking. A real-world pilot study, which utilizes the proposed medical search approach to improve the second use of the EMRs, is reported. We believe that our experience can serve as an important reference for the development of similar applications in a medical data utilization and sharing environment.",

A novel and simple lossless source coding scheme, called PVA (Pre-processing and Valid word length Adaptive coding), is proposed for WDAS under limited communication bandwidth. The proposed coding scheme improves the utilization of communication bandwidth and realizes the real-time compression and transmission by the technique of common binary fields finding, repeating fields reducing and data stream recombination. PVA scheme also improves the precision of the measured signals compared to the normal oversampling method under the same bandwidth. It is thus effective for the applications which are in high demand of fidelity. The experiments on vibration and electroencephalography (EEG) signals show that the proposed PVA scheme is effective and valuable in WDAS.",

Although video-based facial expression analysis has been focused on by many researchers, there are still various problems to be solved in this regard such as noise due to illumination variations over time. Depth video data in the helps to make an FER system person-independent as pixel values in depth images are distributed based on distances from a depth camera. Besides, depth images should resolve some privacy issues as real identity of a user can be hidden. The accuracy of an FER system is much dependent on the extraction of robust features. Here, we propose a novel method to extract salient features from depth faces that are further combined with deep learning for efficient training and recognition. Eight directional strengths are obtained for each pixel in a depth image where signs of some top strengths are arranged to represent unique as well as robust face features, which can be denoted as Modified Local Directional Patterns (MLDP). The MLDP features are further processed by Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) for better face feature extraction. GDA is an efficient tool that helps distinguishing MLDP features of different facial expressions by clustering the features from the same expression as close as possible and separating the features from different expressions as much as possible in a non-linear space. Then, MLDP-GDA features are applied with Deep Belief Network (DBN) for training different facial expressions. Finally, the trained DBN is used to recognize facial expressions in a depth video for testing. The proposed approach was compared with other traditional approaches in a standalone system where the proposed one showed its superiority by achieving mean recognition rate of 96.25% where the other approaches could make 91.67% at the best. The deep learning-based training and recognition of the facial expression features can also be undertaken with cloud computing to support many users and make the system faster than a standalone system.",

With these two strategies, both inserting new nodes and splitting leaves are allowed in the incremental learning phase.

Single port systems are multi-level systems with complex operational-level relationships and interdependencies. Additional levels to this include government and the policy-level. Preparing for the crises and disasters that might befall ports requires information sharing between stakeholders about key dependencies and alternative actions. The complexity of ports presents barriers to information sharing; as do commercial and political sensitivities.

abstract = "Radio frequency (RF) based indoor localisation techniques have gained much attention over the past nearly three decades. Such techniques can be classified as active and passive while passive systems can have either device-assisted or device-free characteristics. Device-free localisation can be a prominent research field as it transcends other device-based approaches in certain application scenarios. Accordingly, we have witnessed an influx of IDFL research focusing on multiple disciplines including occupancy, positioning, activity and identity. However, despite the recent emergence of several exciting technologies and corresponding techniques, IDFL faces some important challenges and because of this, we haven’t come across many mainstream commercial products using RF-based IDFL techniques. In this article, we survey the recent progress of IDFL prioritising on indoor positioning. We decompose the localisation dimensions into occupants, space and time, provide a detailed taxonomy and a comprehensive review of these techniques. We divide the state of the art mainly into Wireless Network-based and Radar-based, evaluate the respective technologies and the techniques qualitatively, discuss trends, limitations and also indicate future research directions relevant to this field.",

A single-step procedure was performed using commercial polymer films to develop laser-induced graphene which was used as electrodes in sensor patches for taste sensing purposes. The cost of these sensor patches is less than two dollars based on the requirement for low-cost polymer films and Kapton tapes for developing the sensor patches. Five different chemicals corresponding to the five fundamental tastes of sour, sweet, salty, bitter and umami were tested with the developed sensors. The electrical parameters of the circuitry formed between the electrode-electrolyte interfaces during the experimental procedure were obtained by using the complex non-linear least square curve fitting technique by fitting a simulation curve to the Cole–Cole curve obtained from the experimental results. The sensor patches operating on a capacitive principle, exhibited significant differences in terms of their impedimetric responses for the kinetic processes taking place during the experiments, with different concentrations for each chemical. Four different concentrations were tested for each chemical to analyze the performance of the sensor for that particular chemical. A comparison between the responses of the five chemicals for each concentration was done to inspect the differences between their responses. An analysis of the differences in the conductivity response by the sensor patch for the five chemicals at a specific concentration was also done. The sensor patches did not show any hysteresis in their output responses, while obtaining significant repeatability when testing the chemicals with them. The response time of the sensor patches was around two seconds with the recovery time is 10min for the sensor being thoroughly washed and dried in between experiments The obtained experimental results from these sensor patches and their low cost, and easy fabrication process make them promising for their utilization in taste sensing purposes.",

Low power transmissions are known to be very error prone. However, high reliability of communications is needed for several healthcare applications. It has been observed that the fluctuations of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) at the nodes of a BAN on a moving person show certain regularities and that the magnitude of these fluctuations are significant (5 – 20 dB). In this paper, we present BANMAC, a medium access control (MAC) protocol based on cross-layer design approach where medium access decisions are tightly integrated with physical layer conditions. BANMAC monitors and predicts the channel fluctuations and schedules transmissions opportunistically when the RSS is likely to be higher. We report the design and implementation details of BANMAC integrated with the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack. We present experimental data which show that the packet loss rate (PLR) of BANMAC is significantly lower as compared to that of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. For comparable PLR, the energy consumption of BANMAC is also significantly lower than that of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.",

The raised alerts have to be analyzed to timely respond to the security incidents. Their analysis, however, is time-consuming and costly. This problem increases with the large number of alerts often raised by anomaly detection systems. To timely and effectively handle security incidents, alerts should be accompanied by information which allows the understanding of incidents and their context (e.g., root causes, attack type) and their prioritization (e.g., criticality level). Unfortunately, the current state of affairs regarding the information about alerts provided by existing anomaly detection systems is not very satisfactory. This work presents an anomaly analysis framework that facilitates the analysis of alerts raised by an anomaly detection system monitoring a database system. The framework provides an approach to assess the criticality of alerts with respect to the disclosure of sensitive information and a feature-based classification of alerts according to their associated type of attack. The framework has been deployed as a web-based alert audit tool that provides alert classification and risk-based ranking capabilities, significantly easing the analysis of alerts. We validate the classification and ranking approaches using synthetic data generated through an existing healthcare management system.",

Integrating the latest advances that employ big data analytics with the networks’ control/traffic layers might be the best way to build robust data communication networks with refined performance and intelligent features. First, the survey starts with the introduction of the big data basic concepts, framework, and characteristics. Second, we illustrate the main network design cycle employing big data analytics. This cycle represents the umbrella concept that unifies the surveyed topics. Third, there is a detailed review of the current academic and industrial efforts toward network design using big data analytics. Forth, we identify the challenges confronting the utilization of big data analytics in network design. Finally, we highlight several future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that addresses the use of big data analytics techniques for the design of a broad range of networks.",

MDDM projects the original data onto a lower-dimensional feature space in which the dependence between the feature and the associated class labels is maximized. However, the computation of MDDM involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition that is computationally expensive for the high-dimensional data. In addition, MDDM cannot be guaranteed to capture the correlation between multiple labels, which are highly beneficial to multi-label learning. To efficiently solve MDDM, in this paper we propose a novel framework that does not require any eigen-decomposition of a matrix. Specifically, our algorithm has linear time complexity in the dimensionality of the data set. Further, we show that MDDM can be reformulated as a least-squares problem, enabling us to integrate the shared subspace that can effectively uncover multiple label interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data collections verify the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

Consequently, identifying ways of effectively reducing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents is of utmost importance. In light of the depicted challenge, latest studies provide promising evidence that in-vehicle decision support systems (DSSs) can have significant positive effects on driving behaviour and collision avoidance. Going beyond existing research, we developed a comprehensive in-vehicle DSS, which provides accident hotspot warnings to drivers based on location analytics applied to a national historical accident dataset, composed of over 266,000 accidents. As such, we depict the design and field evaluation of an in-vehicle DSS, bridging the gap between real world location analytics and in-vehicle warnings. The system was tested in a country-wide field test of 57 professional drivers, with over 170,000km driven during a four-week period, where vehicle data were gathered via a connected car prototype system. Ultimately, we demonstrate that in-vehicle warnings of accident hotspots have a significant improvement on driver behaviour over time. In addition, we provide first evidence that an individual's personality plays a key role in the effectiveness of in-vehicle DSSs. However, in contrast to existing lab experiments with very promising results, we were unable to find an immediate effect on driver behaviour. Hence, we see a strong need for further field experiments with high resolution car data to confirm that in-vehicle DSSs can deliver in diverse field situations.",

In this paper, we explore the ability of this technique to provide secure communication. We enhance the security of OFDM systems in frequency selective fading channels by providing more diversity gain to the legitimate user compared to an eavesdropper. This is done by adapting the interleaving pattern to the channel of the legitimate user in rich multipath environments, where spatially separated channels are typically independent to each other. This ensures secrecy in a time division duplex system, where the eavesdropper has no information regarding the channel of the legitimate user. The scheme can also be used in the conventional frequency division duplex system, which is more challenging in terms of security aspects because of the channel state information leakage. A theoretical analysis is presented on the bit-error probability in Rayleigh fading environment. The numerical results support the conclusion that adapting the interleaving pattern to the CSI of the legitimate user provides a gain in the bit-error rate performance over the eavesdropper.",

Sensor drift errors and distortion are the main challenges of the tracking accuracy of human motion. Traditional filtering and fusion methods, such as Kalman filter, can to some extent reduce the instantaneous error but cannot avoid sensor drift fundamentally. Physical characteristics of human body should be considered and human motion models should be exhibited to describe human motions. The existing models such as skeleton model and cylinder model are either too simple or too complicated for practical applications. In this study, we put forward a geometrical kinematic characteristics based human motion model. The whole human body is viewed as an articulated skeleton and Denavit–Hartenberg convention is adopted to describe the forward kinematics structure. Theoretical analysis is conducted with the derivation of Posterior Cramer–Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) in human movement scenes based on proposed model. Significant superiority is shown in simulation results. An experiment on human lower limb motions is carried out to verify the validity of the proposed human motion model in practice applications, from the angles of both capturing accuracy and energy consumption. The capturing accuracy has an obvious increase in the testing results, with acceptable energy consumption. It is far more efficient than traditional methods.",

Ubiquitous computing provides any services anywhere and anytime through networks conveniently to improve the quality of life of users. Ubiquitous computing is constructed via a variety of invisible sensors, networks, and computing environments. For multi-purpose sensors, deployment of the topology and topology lifetime are very important depending on wired or wireless sensors. Uneven energy consumption due to integrated routing sensors according to topology deployment types is a factor that degrades the quality of service (QoS) about user convenience services and lifetime of total topology. As a result, a number of studies on maximization of topology lifetime have been conducted. However, previous studies focused on deployment environments and limited sensors so that they cannot be deployed to real sites. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive power management scheme (APMS) that manages sensor power adaptively according to deployment environments to maximize topology lifetime. The APMS maximizes topology lifetime by changing routing paths according to lifetime log to manage sensor power. Furthermore, active responses for optimum topology can be achieved by deploying sensors via simulation prior to sensors deployed to the real environments by users.",

abstract = "RPL is a standard routing framework for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). LLNs usually operate in challenged conditions, therefore RPL can be adapted to satisfy requirements of a particular LLN. RPL facilitates this through objective functions (OFs). An OF is used to discover and maintain data forwarding paths based on the requirements of LLNs. In RPL, different OFs can use different routing metrics in different ways. In this paper, we design different OFs and analyse their impact on RPL performance in multi-gateway ad-hoc LLNs. In conjunction with the shortest hop-count, our designed OFs also use the following tie-breaking metrics: available bandwidth, delay, buffer occupancy, and ETX. Our OFs use the tie-breaking metrics on a greedy or an end-to-end basis. In our experimental analysis, we consider the impact of duty-cycling, number of gateways, and data traffic load on the OFs’ performance. Our results demonstrate that, generally speaking, the performance improves with an increase in the number of gateways. In the absence of duty-cycling, the greedy approach is better compared to the end-to-end approach, and using delay, buffer occupancy, and ETX metrics as the tie-breaking metrics in conjunction with the shortest hop-count metric yield the best performance. In a relatively high data traffic load, all OFs perform similarly. In duty-cycling mode, frequent changes in the parent node incur extra synchronization time between a sender and receiver. OFs that use the tie-breaking metrics on an end-to-end basis do not frequently change parent nodes, hence they demonstrate better performance. Furthermore, in duty-cycling mode, the shortest hop-count metric demonstrates the best performance compared to the other metrics.",

In this paper we examine the process of setting up such a comparison and the metric used. Performance comparisons on Cloud and non-Cloud systems, deployed for biomedical scientists, have been conducted to identify improvements of efficiency and performance. Prior to the experiments, network latency, file size and job failures were identified as factors which degrade performance and experiments were conducted to understand their impacts. Organizational Sustainability Modeling (OSM) is used before, during and after the experiments to ensure fair comparisons are achieved. OSM defines the actual and expected execution time, risk control rates and is used to understand key outputs related to both Cloud and non-Cloud experiments. Forty experiments on both Cloud and non-Cloud systems were undertaken with two case studies. The first case study was focused on transferring and backing up 10,000 files of 1 GB each and the second case study was focused on transferring and backing up 1000 files 10 GB each. Results showed that first, the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud was lower than on the non-Cloud system.

abstract = "Disaster recovery (DR) plays a vital role in restoring the organization's data in the case of emergency and hazardous accidents. While many papers in security focus on privacy and security technologies, few address the DR process, particularly for a Big Data system. However, all these studies that have investigated DR methods belong to the “single-basket” approach, which means there is only one destination from which to secure the restored data, and mostly use only one type of technology implementation. We propose a “multi-purpose” approach, which allows data to be restored to multiple sites with multiple methods to ensure the organization recovers a very high percentage of data close to 100%, with all sites in London, Southampton and Leeds data recovered. The traditional TCP/IP baseline, snapshot and replication are used with their system design and development explained. We compare performance between different approaches and multi-purpose approach stands out in the event of emergency. Data at all sites in London, Southampton and Leeds can be restored and updated simultaneously. Results show that optimize command can recover 1 TB of data within 650 s and command for three sites can recover 1 TB of data within 1360 s. All data backup and recovery has failure rate of 1.6% and below. All the data centers should adopt multi-purpose approaches to ensure all the data in the Big Data system can be recovered and retrieved without experiencing a prolong downtime and complex recovery processes. We make recommendations for adopting “multi-purpose” approach for data centers, and demonstrate that 100% of data is fully recovered with low execution time at all sites during a hazardous event as described in the paper.",

We compare iDoctor with previous healthcare recommendation methods using real datasets. The experimental results show that iDoctor provides a higher predication rating and increases the accuracy of healthcare recommendation significantly.",

Universal analytical frameworks taking into account these mechanisms are still missing. The situation is complicated by the possibility of having more than a single transmitter–receiver (Tx–Rx) pair communicating in the environment of interest. In this paper, we develop a framework to characterize performance of the bacterial networks taking all the abovementioned mechanisms into account and capable to address the case of simultaneous communications between a number of Tx–Rx pairs. The framework is based on the absorbing Markov chains theory and allows to reveal inherent trade-offs related to delay performance of bacterial nanonetworks.",

abstract = "The Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) become more and more recognized these recent years and their applications spread in several domains. In general, these applications require that the network presents a minimum degree of reliability, effectiveness and robustness. However, the specificity of the nodes used in this type of networks makes them prone to failures. Indeed, the multichannel communications are generally privileged in the interference context which is very frequent in several WSNs’ applications due to the density of sensors and the harsh environment in which they are deployed. Moreover, in real applications, the occurrence of some faults (for example fire) may alter an entire zone of the network especially in the case of large scale deployment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a network fault recovery approach from simultaneous failures in a large scale multichannel WSN. To make our solution as realistic as possible, we consider the case of the precision agriculture application and propose a detailed deployment of the WSN for that application. The choice of precision agriculture application is motivated by the fact that this application require large scale WSN (thousands and thousands of sensors) to supervise such a large area. Based on such precision agriculture scenario, we propose our fault recovery approach, called Simultaneous Failure Recovery based on Relay Node Relocation (SFR-RNR), that aims to restore the connectivity and partially the coverage in the network. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation.",

This paper presents a container based cloud resource bartering (CRB) model for sharing user's computational resources through a social network. In our approach, we have integrated a Facebook account with the computational cloud to enable tenants to share their unused cloud resources with other users. The performance of the proposed prototype is evaluated under different workloads.

Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) present novel digital systems, which integrate computation, communication and the control of physical resource. Applied CPSs architecture in cloud computing can provide real-time and scalable resource monitoring and offer time-critical applications. With unrivaled scalability and flexibility, the CPSs based cloud services brings significant convenience to customers in need of elastic computing power. The quality of CPSs based cloud services is, to an large extent, determined by the performance of Virtual Machine (VM) placement algorithm for the data center. VM placement also effect the communication between applications and physical resource distribution in cloud computing CPSs. The traditional VM placement algorithm is built upon the two-tier architecture. With the presence of multi-media applications, the application level controller cannot accurately quantify the varying amount computing resources required by VMs at runtime. Consequently, lacking accurate resource demand for each VM, controller at the data center level cannot generate the VM placement with satisfactory feasibility. This architecture no longer fits the modern data centers. In this paper, the two tier VM placement framework is proposed to resolve this technical challenge. Our LP-based variation-unaware VM placement algorithm generates the VM placement with minimized energy consumption. On the other hand, our feasibility driven stochastic VM placement (FDSP) algorithm works seamlessly with the LP-based algorithm to achieve desirable feasibility of the placement. Our experimental results show that the LP-based variation unaware VM placement algorithm improves the energy consumption by 15.3% on average from the baseline algorithm. For test cases with resource request variations, the FDSP algorithm saves 15.7% energy cost compared to the “worst case scenario” of the traditional VM placement paradigm. On the other hand, it improves the feasibility by 50.0% compared to the “best case scenario”.",

In particular, the paper applies the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm implemented in the SUrrogate MOdeling (SUMO) toolbox inside a wireless testbed. Moreover, to cope with the unpredictable nature of wireless testbeds, the paper applies an experiment outlier detection which monitors outside interference and verifies the validity of conducted experiments. The proposed techniques are implemented and evaluated in a wireless testbed using a realistic wireless conferencing scenario. The performance gain and experimentation time of a SUMO optimized experiment is compared against an exhaustively searched experiment.

However, there is an obvious gap between these two localization architectures. In this study, we devise an “IOS” (I ndoor, O utdoor, and S emi-open) detection system. For the lightweight need, a WiFi-based sub-detector is implemented. Using only WiFi sensor and a weak learner, the sub detector is easy to use and energy saving. For the precision demand, an aggregated IOS detector based on a semi-CRF (semi-Markov conditional random fields) algorithm is designed. The attribute of semi-CRF uncovers the interdependency between IOS states, so that it guarantees the accuracy of the detection. The evaluation results show that IOS detector can achieve an over 96% accuracy in tested environments. This detection technique holds the potential to realize the seamless localization from indoor to outdoor, and vice versa.",

Specifically, fuzzy logic control is used to build a simple, generic, and efficient nonlinear control law that dynamically calculates the input link cost. Basing the link cost on traffic load and power consumption and not on empty buffer slots, makes the proposed algorithm applicable to both buffered and bufferless NoCs. Hardware implementation in ASIC and FPGA technologies demonstrate that the hardware area overhead imposed by the fuzzy control logic is from minimal to negligible for practical flit sizes and scales excellently with network size. Furthermore, since the fuzzy control logic is not in the router critical path, it imposes no additional latency. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed routing scheme through simulative evaluation against representative conventional counterparts.",

abstract = "Emergence of diverse renewable energy harvesting technologies and their incorporation into tiny sensor devices have given birth to Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs), where the problem domain has shifted from energy conservation to energy sustainability of the network. Renewable energy harvesting and depletion of sensor devices are stochastic and thus, energy availability in the devices is sporadic rather than continuous. Therefore, the optimal deployment of data routing devices (i.e., relay nodes) and their activity scheduling to ensure that, the data from all source sensors could be routed to the sink while keeping the network functional perpetually, is a challenging research problem. In this paper, we develop a multi-constraint mixed integer linear program (MILP) to minimize the number of relay nodes to be deployed in the network, while considering connectivity, sustainability and unpredictable energy harvesting and depletion rates. We refer to this problem as SMRMC (sustainable minimum-relay maximum-connectivity deployment) which is proved to be NP-hard. A light weight k-connected greedy solution to the SMRMC problem has been developed first for k=1, and thereafter, a generalized solution has been presented for any k (k ≥ 2) by constructing convex-polytopes among the existing relay nodes. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed deployment strategies. Performance studies carried out in MATLAB, show that the proposed SMRMC algorithms can achieve up to twice the network lifetime compared to state-of-the-art approaches whilst deploying minimum number of relay nodes.",

In such networks mobile entities traverse the network and wirelessly replenish the energy of sensor nodes. In recent research on collaborative wireless charging, the mobile entities are also allowed to charge each other. In this work, we enhance the collaborative feature by forming a hierarchical charging structure. We distinguish the Chargers in two groups, the hierarchically lower Mobile Chargers which charge sensor nodes and the hierarchically higher Special Chargers which charge Mobile Chargers. We define the Coordination Decision Problem and prove that it is NP-complete. Also, we propose a new protocol for 1-D networks which we compare with a state of the art protocol. Motivated by the improvement in 1-D networks, we propose and implement four new collaborative charging protocols for 2-D networks, in order to achieve efficient charging and improve important network properties. Our protocols are either centralized or distributed, and assume different levels of network knowledge. Extensive simulation findings demonstrate significant performance gains, with respect to non-collaborative state of the art charging methods. In particular, our protocols improve several network properties and metrics, such as the network lifetime, routing robustness, coverage and connectivity. A useful feature of our methods is that they can be suitably added on top of non-collaborative protocols to further enhance their performance.",

abstract = "We investigate the problem of placing monitors to localize node failures in a communication network from binary states (normal/failed) of end-to-end paths, under the assumption that a path is in normal state if and only if it contains no failed nodes. To uniquely localize failed nodes, the measurement paths must show different symptoms (path states) under different failure events. Our goal is to deploy the minimum set of monitors to satisfy this condition for a given probing mechanism. We consider three families of probing mechanisms, according to whether measurement paths are (i) arbitrarily controllable, (ii) controllable but cycle-free, or (iii) uncontrollable (i.e., determined by the default routing protocol). We first establish theoretical conditions that characterize network-wide failure identifiability through a per-node identifiability measure that can be efficiently evaluated for the above three probing mechanisms. Leveraging these results, we develop a generic monitor placement algorithm, applicable under any probing mechanism, that incrementally selects monitors to optimize the per-node measure. The proposed algorithm is shown to be optimal for probing mechanism (i), and provides upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of monitors required by the other probing mechanisms. In the special case of single-node failures, we develop an improved monitor placement algorithm that is optimal for probing mechanism (ii) and has linear time complexity. Using these algorithms, we study the impact of the probing mechanism on the number of monitors required for uniquely localizing node failures. Our results based on real network topologies show that although more complicated to implement, probing mechanisms that allow monitors to control measurement paths substantially reduce the required number of monitors.",

Drug transmitters have limited resources in terms of energy and reservoir and these limitations should be taken into consideration when designing a drug delivery system. Drug molecules may also be expensive and releasing a large amount of them can have harmful effects on the healthy parts of the body. In this paper, we consider a multiple transmitter local drug delivery system in which the nearest transmitters to a randomly located tumor are activated to release drug molecules and guarantee the Least Effective Concentration (LEC) in every part of the tumor. We propose two different scenarios: a single transmitter drug delivery system for which the optimal rate of the transmitting nanomachine and the optimal density of deployed nanomachines are derived through formulations and simulations. Poisson distributed as well as regular square and hexagon grid deployments are investigated. We then extend it to a multiple transmitter drug delivery system for which the optimal allocated rate to each releasing transmitter is derived in order to minimize the total rate of release and maintain LEC in every part of the tumor. It is shown that activating multiple transmitters leads to a reduction in the total optimal release rate of drug molecules as well as improving the time duration between consecutive administrations.",

In this paper, a memory-assisted medium access control (MAC) protocol with angular-division-multiplexing (ADM) is proposed for THz communication networks. The service region of an access point (AP) is divided into multiple angular slots by exploiting the 3D quantized angular space, For efficient service discovery and communications, a node equips with (i) the omni-directional antennas at the service discovery phase, and (ii) directional antennas for message transmissions. Moreover, the memory is leveraged in the ADM scheme to assist the AP to skip the unregistered angular slots to improve the network performance. Based on the proposed MAC protocol, the analytical models of the interference, SINR, outage probability, throughput and the delay in the THz network are derived respectively. According to the simulation and numerical analysis, the results show that our proposed MAC protocol can effectively improve the throughput by over 15% and substantially reduce the delay, in comparison with the ADM scheme without the memory guidance.",

To address these communication challenges, in this paper link-quality-aware routing algorithm (LQ-CMST) as well as the priority and channel-aware multi-channel (PCA-MC) scheduling algorithm have been proposed for smart grid applications. Furthermore, the effect of different modulation and encoding schemes on the performance of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated under harsh smart grid channel conditions. Comparative performance evaluations through extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce communication delay and the choice of encoding and modulation schemes is critical to meet the requirements of envisioned smart grid applications.",

In this work, local authentication and remote authentication are respectively designed for cloud assisted wearable devices. In the local authentication mode, hash based selective disclosure mechanism and Chebyshev chaotic map are jointly applied to achieve mutual authentication between a wearable device and a smart phone. In the remote authentication mode, Merkle hash tree based selective disclosure mechanism is designed to improve the structure of data fields in the certificate, and a yoking-proof is established to realize interactions between two wearable devices and a smart phone, and is further transmitted to the cloud server for simultaneous verification.

So most of the experiments with biological nanodevices are not repeatable. Additionally, the usage of bacteria cells can be dangerous as they can become dangerous after they encountered with other bacteria cells Akgül and Canberk (2014). The idea of synthetic nanodevices is proposed as a solution to the uncertainty and safety problems of biological nanodevices. However, the most basic attribute of this concept is still a mystery. The data-gathering process in synthetic nanodevices is also essential for biological nanodevices. In the existing studies, usually the user directly presents the data to the nanodevice. However, as most of the nanonetwork applications are intra-body applications, the idea of collecting data from the environment is crucial for nanodevices. To the best of our knowledge any data-gathering process from the environment is not covered yet. Collecting the data from the surroundings is essential to determine the state of the environment and to determine the action of the nanodevice. In this study, we are presenting a knowledge harvesting framework that is designed for synthetic nanodevice model presented in Akgül and Canberk (2014). As the model is applied for mobile synthetic devices, the transmission of the harvested data becomes a challenge.

abstract = "In a tree-based Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN), data acquisition can be done through a mobile actor to reduce the traffic congestion. However, packet dropping at the resource-limited (such as, buffer space and energy) intermediate nodes leads to poor data delivery and energy efficiency. In this paper, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based buffer management mechanism has been proposed in tree-based WSAN to reduce the data delivery delay and to improve the energy efficiency. A mathematical model for a mobile actor has been presented to analyze buffer occupancy and energy consumption with real-time traffic. The state of a node is represented based on buffer levels which may change with dynamic traffic. The buffer states are analyzed at which packets will be dropped to minimize the average delivery delay and energy consumption. Extensive simulations have been performed to show the efficacy of proposed mechanism in terms of average end-to-end delay and energy consumption.",

abstract = "In order to reduce the energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), this paper proposes a distributed event-triggered communication for time synchronization. The clock feature of each node is modeled as the discrete-time second-order dynamics. Each node in the network determines whether and when to broadcast its states to its neighbors based on an event trigger mechanism. For each node in the network, the trigger function is designed based on the disagreement between its current states and those estimated from last transmitted, which thus is independent of the states of its in-neighbors. Then the condition about the updating period and the control gain is presented to guarantee the time synchronization of the network. It is shown that the proposed event-triggered communication can play a good tradeoff between the convergence rate and the communication rate of the time synchronization algorithm, and it also outperforms the corresponding time-triggered communication in the case that the same communication rate is used. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Traditional contacting methods are difficult to satisfy the needs of on-line testing, enduring extreme conditions and non-invasion. Nowadays non-contact vibration measurement at blade tips by optical sensing has become a promising approach. In this paper a blade tip-timing (BTT) method using four optical-fiber sensors is presented and all-blade vibration displacements are derived in detail. Blade vibration signals collected by the BTT method are typical sub-sampled signals, so a signal reconstruction method is proposed based on the Shannon sampling theorem. Next nine candidate vibration parameters are calculated to form the crack feature space and principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract principal components from it. Then Euclidian angles of principal components are defined to detect cracks. In the end, an experimental set-up is built and a small crack is cut on a blade artificially. Collected data are analyzed to testify the proposed method and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.",

In this paper, we present PACL (Privacy-Aware Contextual Localizer) model, which can learn user’s contextual location just by passively monitoring user’s network traffic. PACL can discern a set of vital attributes (statistical and application-based) from user’s network traffic, and predict user’s contextual location with a very high accuracy.

abstract = "In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), routing data towards the sink leads to unbalanced energy consumption among intermediate nodes resulting in high data loss rate. The use of multiple Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs) has been proposed in the literature to mitigate such problems. MDCs help to achieve uniform energy-consumption across the network, fill coverage gaps, and reduce end-to-end communication delays, amongst others. However, mechanisms to support MDCs such as location advertisement and route maintenance introduce significant overhead in terms of energy consumption and packet delays. In this paper, we propose a self-organizing and adaptive Dynamic Clustering (DCMDC) solution to maintain MDC-relay networks. This solution is based on dividing the network into well-delimited clusters called Service Zones (SZs). Localizing mobility management traffic to a SZ reduces signaling overhead, route setup delay and bandwidth utilization. Network clustering also helps to achieve scalability and load balancing. Smaller network clusters make buffer overflows and energy depletion less of a problem. These performance gains are expected to support achieving higher information completeness and availability as well as maximizing the network lifetime. Moreover, maintaining continuous connectivity between the MDC and sensor nodes increases information availability and validity. Performance experiments show that DCMDC outperforms its rival in the literature. Besides the improved quality of information, the proposed approach improves the packet delivery ratio by up to 10%, end-to-end delay by up to 15%, energy consumption by up to 53%, energy balancing by up to 51%, and prolongs the network lifetime by up to 53%.",

However, for large areas with limited use of vehicles such as theme parks, evacuation of pedestrians and emergent events must be tracked for safety reasons. As hazards may cause certain damages to services, networks with disaster resilience are needed to achieve mission-critical operations such as search and rescue. In this paper, we develop a method for tracking pedestrians and emergent events during disasters by opportunistic ad hoc communication. In our network model, smart-phones of pedestrians store and carry messages to a limited number of mobile sinks. Mobile sinks are responsible for communicating with smart-phones and reaching the emergent events effectively. Since the positioning of the mobile sinks has a direct impact to the network performance, we propose physical force based (PF), grid allocation based (GA) and road allocation based (RA) approaches for sink placement and mobility. The proposed approaches are analyzed through extensive network simulations using real theme park maps and a human mobility model for disaster scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve significantly better network coverage and higher rescue success without producing increased communication overhead compared to two random mobile sink movement models.",

abstract = "With advancement in radio frequency identification (RFID), RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting has attracted considerable research interests. Track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting demands a trustworthy electronic pedigree (e-pedigree), which records the movements of product items from manufacturers to retailers, to ensure high supply chain visibility and to provide evidence for product authentication. Creation and synchronization of initial e-pedigrees in the manufacturing stage is particularly crucial to the accuracy and trustworthiness of subsequent processing of the e-pedigrees and authentication of product items. This is a critical yet challenging task, as it involves a number of practical issues, such as incomplete tag writing/locking, environment disturbances, and potential data falsification. This paper first presents an innovative track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting system, and then proposes a tag data processing and synchronization (TDPS) algorithm to generate initial e-pedigrees for general, tangible products during production. An RFID-enabled apparel packaging line is established to validate the performance of TDPS and identify the bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Experiment results show that TDPS can create accurate and secure initial e-pedigrees for fast moving product items, and that tag EPC writing is a major bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Thus, we optimise TDPS by incorporating a block writing method and an integrated verification step to remove the bottleneck. Further experiments demonstrate the optimised TDPS can be adapted to suit different practical requirements to achieve a good balance between tag writing/locking rate and the moving speed of product items in packaging lines without severing the throughput.",

Contrary to existing solutions, which focus on shortening the charging delays, OMC groups incoming charging requests and optimizes the charging tour and the mobile charger energy consumption. Although slightly increasing the waiting time before nodes are charged, this allows taking advantage of multiple simultaneous charges and also reduces node failures. At the tour planning level, a new modeling approach is used. It leverages simultaneous energy transfer to multiple nodes by maximizing the number of sensors that are charged at each stop. Given its NP-hardness, tour planning is approximated through a clique partitioning problem, which is solved using a lightweight heuristic approach. The proposed schemes are evaluated in offline and on-demand scenarios and compared against relevant state-of-the-art protocols. The results in the offline scenario show that the path planning strategy reduces the number of stops and the energy consumed by the mobile charger, compared to existing offline solutions. This is with further reduction in time complexity, due to the simple heuristics that are used. The results in the on-demand scenario confirm the effectiveness of the path planning strategy. More importantly, they show the impact of path planning, TTL and multi-node charging on the efficiency of handling the requests, in a way that reduces node failures and the mobile charger energy expenditure.",

The approach considers risks in all phases of the business process management lifecycle, from process design, where risks are defined on top of process models, through to process diagnosis, where risks are detected during process execution. The approach has been realized via a distributed, sensor-based architecture. At design-time, sensors are defined to specify risk conditions which when fulfilled, are a likely indicator of negative process states (faults) to eventuate. Both historical and current process execution data can be used to compose such conditions. At run-time, each sensor independently notifies a sensor manager when a risk is detected. In turn, the sensor manager interacts with the monitoring component of a business process management system to prompt the results to process administrators who may take remedial actions. The proposed architecture has been implemented on top of the YAWL system, and evaluated through performance measurements and usability tests with students. The results show that risk conditions can be computed efficiently and that the approach is perceived as useful by the participants in the tests.",

We propose Pump-and-Nap, a packet train forwarding technique that maximizes throughput while simultaneously enforcing compliance to dynamic duty cycle limitations. A node using Pump-and-Nap operates by pumping a train of packets followed by a napping period where the node forgoes any transmission. Pump-and-Nap employs an adaptive controller to periodically compute the optimal capacity, that is, the maximum number of packets a node can receive and transmit in a train, given its duty cycle constraint. The controller uses prior input-output observations (capacity allocations and their corresponding duty cycle usage) to continuously tune its performance and adapt to wireless link quality variations. Its use of local information makes the controller easily deployable in a distributed fashion. We implemented Pump-and-Nap in TinyOS and evaluated its performance through experiments and testbed simulations. Results show that Pump-and-Nap provides high transfer throughput while it simultaneously tracks the target duty cycle. More importantly, Pump-and-Nap enables sustainable bulk transfer compared to state-of-the-art techniques that greedily maximize throughput at the expense of downtime due to energy depletion.",

Web applications have become the most popular way to deliver essential services to customers, and the increasing dependency of individuals on web applications makes them an attractive target for adversaries. The adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the database-driven applications to craft injection attacks which include SQL, XQuery and XPath injections. A large amount of work has been done on identification of SQL injection vulnerabilities resulting in several tools available for the purpose. However, a limited work has been done so far for the identification of XML injection vulnerabilities and the existing tools only identify XML injection vulnerabilities which could lead to a specific type of attack. Hence, this work proposes a black-box fuzzing approach to detect different types of XQuery injection vulnerabilities in web applications driven by native XML databases. A prototype XQueryFuzzer is developed and tested on various vulnerable applications developed with BaseX as the native XML database. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the prototype is effective against detection of XQuery injection vulnerabilities.

abstract = "Corporate credit ratings are one of the key problems of the credit risk management, which has attracted much research attention since the credit crisis in 2007. Scorecards are the most widely used approaches for corporate credit ratings nowadays. However, they have heavy dependency on the involvement of users. AI technologies, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance on automatic corporate credit ratings. Corporate credit ratings involve various rating models, and their outputs can scale to multiple levels and be used for various applications. Such inherent complexity gives rise to the requirement of higher demands on the effectiveness of learning algorithms regarding the accuracy, overfitness, error distribution, and output distribution. Most research works show that SVMs have better performance than ANNs on accuracy. This paper carries out a comprehensive experimental comparison study over the effectiveness of four learning algorithms, i.e., BP, ELM, I-ELM, and SVM over a data set consisting of real financial data for corporate credit ratings. The results are presented and discussed in the paper.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel disease-specific feature selection method which consists of a one-versus-one (OvO) features ranking stage and a feature search stage wrapped in the same OvO-rule support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier. The proposed method differs from traditional approaches in that it focuses on the selection of effective feature subsets for distinguishing a class from others by making OvO comparison. The electrocardiograms (ECG) from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH-AR) are used to evaluate the proposed feature selection method. The ECG features adopted include inter-beat and intra-beat intervals, amplitude morphology, area morphology and morphological distance. Following the recommendation of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), all the heartbeat samples of MIT-BIH-AR are grouped into four classes, namely, normal or bundle branch block (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). The division of training and testing data complies with the inter-patient schema. Experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed feature selection method is 86.66%, outperforming those methods without feature selection. The sensitivities for the classes N, S, V and F are 88.94%, 79.06%, 85.48% and 93.81% respectively, and the corresponding positive predictive values are 98.98%, 35.98%, 92.75% and 13.74% respectively. In terms of geometric means of sensitivity and positive predictivity, the proposed method also demonstrates better performance than other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.",

Malicious users can collaborate to break forward and backward secrecy. Solutions have been proposed to prevent collusion attacks on OFT scheme. In this paper, we first demonstrate how existing solutions only partially consider collusion attacks. Current models surmise scenarios where malicious users may obtain node secrets unknown through collusion. They do not, however, consider that malicious users can decrypt extra blinded node secrets using known node secrets. As a result, the malicious users can collude to obtain far more information than expected. We use theoretical evidence to identify the exact node secrets which can be obtain by malicious users. Finally, we propose two improved schemes named repeated one-way function tree (ROFT) and node one-way function tree (NOFT). Compared to previous solutions, ROFT and NOFT require less adjustments to make the OFT scheme resilient to collusion attacks. Performance analysis shows that ROFT and NOFT do not incur extra communication overhead compared to the original OFT scheme. The proposed ROFT and NOFT schemes effectively solve the security problem of the OFT scheme at the cost of a minimal increase in computational cost and storage overhead.",

Novel solutions are, therefore, required, which aim at drastically reducing the collision probability of devices with critical level of residual battery energy. In this paper, we propose a virtual code resource allocation (VCRA) approach which extends the code-expanded strategy to support a high number of devices simultaneously accessing the system. Besides, a virtual resource allocation scheme to guarantee energy-priority in the access procedure is introduced. The idea behind our proposal is the definition of different access levels that exploit disjoint sets of access codewords, properly tailored to guarantee high capacity for each access level. Simulation results show to the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of (i) reducing the collision probability of machines with limited battery capabilities also in scenarios with very high cell load and (ii) enhancing the efficiency with respect to legacy code-expanded strategy.",

abstract = "Recent software engineering paradigms such as software product lines, supporting development techniques like feature modeling, and cloud provisioning models such as platform and infrastructure as a service, allow for great flexibility during both software design and deployment, resulting in potentially large cost savings. However, all this flexibility comes with a catch: as the combinatorial complexity of optional design features and deployment variability increases, the difficulty of assessing system qualities such as scalability and quality of service increases too. And if the software itself is not scalable (for instance, because of a specific set of selected features), deploying additional service instances is a futile endeavor. Clearly there is a need to systematically measure the impact of feature selection on scalability, as the potential cost savings can be completely mitigated by the risk of having a system that is unable to meet service demand. In this work, we document our results on systematic load testing for automated quality of service and scalability analysis. The major contribution of our work is tool support and a methodology to analyze the scalability of these distributed, feature oriented multi-tenant software systems in a continuous integration process. We discuss our approach to select features for load testing such that a representative set of feature combinations is used to elicit valuable information on the performance impact and feature interactions. Additionally, we highlight how our methodology and framework for performance and scalability prediction differs from state-of-practice solutions. We take the viewpoint of both the tenant of the service and the service provider, and report on our experiences applying the approach to an industrial use case in the domain of electronic payments. We conclude that the integration of systematic scalability tests in a continuous integration process offers strong advantages to software developers and service providers, such as the ability to quantify the impact of new features in existing service compositions, and the early detection of hidden feature interactions that may negatively affect the overall performance of multi-tenant services.",

The WirelessHART protocol is the first open and interoperable industrial wireless sensor network standard, which proposes a combination of time division multiple access (TDMA) and channel hopping as a medium access control (MAC) protocol. TDMA is a schedule-based protocol, which is suitable for predictable cyclic traffic. However, for burst acyclic traffic, TDMA degenerates into an inefficient slotted ALOHA. In this article, we propose a complementary mechanism to TDMA, CCA-Embedded TDMA, which can be applied to improve the transmission efficiency and system stability of TDMA-based systems such as the WirelessHART protocol. A Markov model is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of system throughput and expected delay of CCA-Embedded TDMA. Furthermore, we show by analytical and simulation results that our proposed CCA-Embedded TDMA scheme can increase the throughput by 100% and reduce the expected delay by 75% for a common scenario. We also implement CCA-Embedded TDMA into an embedded system as a part of the WirelessHART MAC protocol. The experimental results verify the efficiency of CCA-Embedded TDMA and its backward compatibility with the WirelessHART protocol.",

abstract = "With an increase in the capabilities of sensors, wireless visual sensor networks (WVSNs) are being researched to perform more complicated tasks as each visual sensor performs video capture, processing and sharing. Because each visual sensor operates by using its own resources including computation and communication under a limited power supply, it is necessary to develop an energy management scheme suitable for WVSNs. In particular, when multiple camera modules of visual sensors are aimed at some regions with different fields of views (FOVs), undesirable power consumption for encoding may occur among distributed visual sensors. Because some overlapped FOVs among captured images give rise to encoding redundancy, this leads to an increase in data quantity and power consumption for the encoding and communication. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel strategy for lifetime maximization of the WVSN. In order to estimate overlapped FOVs without using complicated procedures such as pattern or object recognition, we propose a geographical model to estimate overlapped FOVs based on location and visual direction. Based on this model, the power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) is determined and used to construct an optimization problem for minimizing the power consumption of each node. Through the proposed scheme, including distributed power allocation and node scheduling under simple information sharing, the network lifetime is maximized. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

abstract = "The Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) conjugates the identification potential of the RFID technology and the sensing and computing capability of the wireless sensors. Practical issues, such as the need of periodically recharging WISPs, challenge the effective deployment of large-scale RFID sensor networks (RSNs) consisting of RFID readers and WISP nodes. In this view, the paper proposes cooperative solutions to energize the WISP devices in a wide-area sensing network while reducing the data collection delay. The main novelty is the fact that both data transmissions and energy transfer are based on the RFID technology only: RFID mobile readers gather data from the WISP devices, wirelessly recharge them, and mutually cooperate to reduce the data delivery delay to the sink. Communication between mobile readers relies on two proposed solutions: a tag-based relay scheme, where RFID tags are exploited to temporarily store sensed data at pre-determined contact points between the readers; and a tag-based data channel scheme, where the WISPs are used as a virtual communication channel for real time data transfer between the readers. Both solutions require: (i) clustering the WISP nodes; (ii) dimensioning the number of required RFID mobile readers; (iii) planning the tour of the readers under the energy and time constraints of the nodes. A simulative analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solutions when compared to non-cooperative approaches. Differently from classic schemes in the literature, the solutions proposed in this paper better cope with scalability issues, which is of utmost importance for wide area networks.",

abstract = "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of networks composed of tiny devices equipped with sensing, processing, storage, and wireless communication capabilities. WSN nodes have limited computing resources and are usually powered by batteries. First generations of WSNs were designed to attend requirements of a unique target application usually with a single user, who was also the infrastructure owner. However, the rapid evolution in this area and the increasing of the complexity of the sensors and applications pose new challenges to WSN solutions, which can be addressed by specific middleware platforms for these networks. Existing middleware systems provide suitable mechanisms to define the high-level application logic and to deal with heterogeneity and distribution issues of WSN, but most of them do not provide explicit mechanisms to define the underlying autonomic behavior of the system, an essential feature of this kind of network. In this perspective, Autonomic Computing (AC) appears as a promising option to meet autonomic requirements in WSN middleware design. This paper presents the consolidated specification of RAMSES, a reference architecture of a self-adaptive middleware for WSNs. RAMSES was conceived in light of a well-stablished Reference Architecture Model, the RAModel. It follows the autonomic computing model MAPE-K, and presents a mapping of AC conceptual model to a set of software components. We claim that, with the aid of a middleware that supports the autonomic computing principles, a WSN becomes an autonomous WSN by design. RAMSES realizes our vision by providing: (i) an architectural template with core aspects of the self-adaptive systems from which is possible to build concrete middleware instances for self-adaptive WSNs, and (ii) a specification of the reference architecture using a formal architecture description language (Pi-ADL), which enables the representation of dynamic software architectures as required by WSNs. A scenario-based qualitative analysis and a checklist survey conducted with experts demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMSES. Moreover, a concrete WSN middleware instance derived from RAMSES was implemented as a proof of concept.",

A security and cost-aware workflow scheduling algorithm was selected to evaluate the performance of the metaheuristics. Three algorithms were evaluated in three real-world workflows with a risk rate constraint that ranged between 0 and 1 with a 0.1 step. The findings indicate that GA-based algorithms significantly outperformed the PSO both in term of cost-effectiveness and response time.",

An essential operation in such environment is the parallel join, the performance of which is critical for data intensive operations. In many real-world workloads, data skew is omnipresent. Techniques that do not cater for the possibility of data skew often suffer from performance failures and memory problems. State-of-the-art methods designed to handle data skew propose new ways to distribute computation that avoid hotspots. However, this comes at the expense of global collection of statistics, redundant computation, duplication of data or increased network communication. In this light, performance could be further improved by removing the dependency on global skew knowledge and broadcasting. In this paper, we propose a new method called PRPQ (partial redistribution & partial query), with targets for efficient and robust joins with large datasets over high performance clusters. We present the detailed implementation of our approach and compare its performance with current implementations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is scalable and robust and can also outperform the state-of-the-art approach with less network communication, figures that confirm our theoretical analysis.",

abstract = "Client/server routing forwards data samples from the source nodes to the sink through single or multi-hop paths which are formed over a flat or hierarchical infrastructure. Depending on the routing infrastructure, the intermediate nodes may perform in-network data aggregation to collect and combine the data samples which are measures of the environmental events. Minimising energy consumption is a vital requirement due to resource constraints in wireless sensor networks. Data collection delay should be minimised as it is the key to data freshness. At the same time, the number of collected data samples should be maximised, as it should lead to increased accuracy and robustness in data collection. Owing to these, we define the system objective to be maximising the number of delivered data samples, while minimising energy consumption and data collection delay. We propose a cluster-based client/server data aggregation routing protocol called Cluster-Based client/server data Aggregation routing protocol (CBA). It dynamically partitions the network into a set of data-centric clusters using a lightweight clustering approach based on the Hamming distance. The cluster-heads then form a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) as the network backbone to forward aggregated results to the sink. A parallel collision-guided technique is used to minimise the establishment cost of the tree infrastructure. Compared with the conventional routing protocols like MR-LEACH and Directed DiFFusion, CBA reduces energy consumption and data collection delay and increases accuracy (the number of captured data samples). In addition, our protocol reduces the impacts of the network architecture and the event source distribution model (distributed and centralised) on the performance of data aggregation routing.",

In this synergy, the cloud service providers provide various services, namely, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) to their clients. In such a provision, both the end parties demand proper auditing so that the resources can be legitimately utilized, and meanwhile the privacy is also preserved. In order to achieve this goal, there is a need for designing an efficient and robust authentication mechanism. Though other existing authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, Open Authorization (OAuth) and OpenID are proposed in the literature, they are vulnerable to various security threats such as replay, online dictionary, offline dictionary, stolen-verifier, impersonation, denial-of-service, privileged-insider and man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, we aim to propose an authentication protocol which overcomes these security loopholes in the existing protocols. In the proposed protocol, a new dynamic password-based two-server authentication and key exchange mechanism is proposed with the help of both public and private key cryptography. Moreover, to achieve strong user anonymity property, a new multi-factor authentication scheme with identity preservation has been also introduced. The security analysis using both the formal security using the broadly-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and the informal security show that the proposed protocol protects several well-known attacks. In addition, the formal security verification using the widely-used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) ensures that the scheme is resilient against replay as well as man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, the performance study contemplates that the overheads incurred in the protocol is reasonable and comparable to that of other existing state-of-art authentication protocols. High security along with comparable overheads make the proposed protocol to be robust and practical for a secure access to the cloud services.",

The number of malware has skyrocketed through the use of enormous malware development toolkit. Run-time analysis has recently been used to overcome the limitations of current detection engines due to code obfuscation techniques such as polymorphism and metamorphism. However run-time approaches face a critical challenge of processing a large number of run-time malware features which may fail to provide real time protection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework by using more than one complementary filters and a wrapper feature selection approach to identify the most significant run-time behavioural characteristics of malware. The novelty of the proposed framework is that it exploits the complementary characteristics of within-filters and between wrapper-filters by hybridizing discriminant, minimum redundant, and maximum relevant filters with the wrapper approach to integrate the knowledge from the intrinsic characteristics of the run-time behaviour of malware obtained by the filters into the wrapper selection process. We have verified the performance of the proposed approach through extensive experiments using large real malware datasets. The results of the experiments show that the proposed framework finds the most significant run-time characteristics of malware. When these are used in the detection engine, the computational performances and detection accuracies are also improved up to 99.499% compared to any existing techniques.",

Current wireless communication systems work at half duplex mode in an either time-division or frequency-division approach to transmit and receive wireless signals. Half duplex results in poor spectral efficiency because only unidirectional communications are allowed. Recent research has aimed at enabling In-band full duplex wireless communication that allows a wireless node for simultaneous transmission and reception of signals. The benefits of in-band full duplex includes the doubled spectra efficiency which is in great need in the rapidly growing IoT devices and the potentials to solve the hidden terminals, unfairness and the exposed problems presented in the current single channel half duplex wireless communications. This paper investigates the research background and progress of in-band full duplex wireless. It also presents the research problems as well as opportunities. In addition, this paper summarizes the performance of literature solutions with experiment results in achieving in-band full duplex wireless communications.

On-demand computing resources of Public Clouds have become a natural host for these MapReduce applications. However, the decision of what type and in what amount computing and storage resources should be rented is still a user’s responsibility. This is not a trivial task particularly when users may have performance constraints such as deadline and have several Cloud product types to choose with the intention of not spending much money. Even though there are several existing scheduling systems, however, most of them are not developed to manage the scheduling of MapReduce applications. That is, they do not consider things such as number of map and reduce tasks that are needed to be scheduled and heterogeneity of Virtual Machines (VMs) available. This paper proposes a novel greedy-based MapReduce application scheduling algorithm (MASA) that considers the user’s constraints in order to minimize cost of renting Cloud resources while considering Service Level Agreements (SLA) in terms of the user given budget and deadline constraints. The simulation results show that MASA can achieve 25–50% cost reduction in comparison to current SLA agnostic methods and there is only 10% performance disparity between MASA and an exhaustive search algorithm.",

abstract = "In recent years, Mobile Social Networks (MSNs) have been arising a growing interest in both scientific and industrial fields for its potential value. The effective data transmission of MSNs is generally achieved through opportunistic forwarding and node collaboration. However, malicious nodes may illegally intercept and drop the data packets which should be forwarded. Therefore, it is very challenging to detect these malicious nodes. In this paper, we proposed a new Resisting On–Off Attack Data Forwarding Mechanism (OADM) for MSNs to detect the on–off attack, which not only prevents malicious nodes from intercepting data packets, but also exploits the node collaboration to forward data packets. Our major contribution includes: (1) Exploiting Hidden Markov Model (HMM) model to learn node behaviors for the evaluation of attacking probabilities and node states; (2) Effective relay node selection based the estimation of node capability. Results show the proposed OADM can effectively identify the attacking behavior and collaborating states of nodes and significantly improve the data delivery rate of MSNs.",

As the TbDyFe acts as a magnetic field transducer and PS-FBG as a strain sensor, the magnetic field strength distribution of two permanent magnets can be measured by monitoring the reflected intensity variations of the PS-FBG probe.

abstract = "Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are vulnerable to various kinds of threats due to their dynamic nature and lack of a central point of control. Collaborative attacks occur when multiple attackers synchronize their actions to disrupt a target network. A wormhole attack is one of the most severe collaborative attacks, as it can harm a network in several ways. Wormhole attacks are very difficult to detect, as they are launched by two or more nodes in collaboration with each other and they work in two phases. In the first phase, malicious nodes try to convince legitimate nodes to transfer data through them in order to get acces to more routes. In the second phase, malicious nodes exploit the received data in a variety of ways. In this paper, we propose a Detection and Prevention System (DPS) to detect and block malicious nodes in MANETs. For this purpose, special nodes called DPS nodes, which continuously monitor the behavior of other nodes, are deployed in a network. When a DPS node finds a node exhibiting pre-defined suspicious behavior, it declares that suspicious node as a wormhole node by broadcasting a message. All data and control messages from a node that has been declared as wormhole node are discarded by the network. NS-2 simulations show that the proposed DPS considerably reduces the number of packets dropped by malicious nodes with very low false positive rate.",

It provides dynamic, on-demand and scalable resources that enable the processing of complex workflow-based experiments. With the ever growing size of the experimental data and increasingly complex processing workflows, the need for reproducibility has also become essential. Provenance has been thought of a mechanism to verify a workflow and to provide workflow reproducibility. One of the obstacles in reproducing an experiment execution is the lack of information about the execution infrastructure in the collected provenance. This information becomes critical in the context of Cloud in which resources are provisioned on-demand and by specifying resource configurations. Therefore, a mechanism is required that enables capturing of infrastructure information along with the provenance of workflows executing on the Cloud to facilitate the re-creation of execution environment on the Cloud. This paper presents a framework to Reproduce Scientific Workflow Execution using Cloud-Aware Provenance (ReCAP), along with the proposed mapping approaches that aid in capturing the Cloud-aware provenance information and help in re-provisioning the execution resource on the Cloud with similar configurations. Experimental evaluation has shown the impact of different resource configurations on the workflow execution performance, therefore justifies the need for collecting such provenance information in the context of Cloud. The evaluation has also demonstrated that the proposed mapping approaches can capture Cloud information in various Cloud usage scenarios without causing performance overhead and can also enable the re-provisioning of resources on Cloud. Experiments were conducted using workflows from different scientific domains such as astronomy and neuroscience to demonstrate the applicability of this research for different workflows.",

Cryptographer prefers to secure algorithms against known attacks; however designer focuses on efficient implementation. It has been established in several researches that an attack on implementation of a cipher requires far less effort than exploiting mathematical weakness of the structure. Implementation vulnerabilities are utilized by side channel attacks (SCA). In practical environment a block cipher is implemented in one of the modes of encryption like ECB, CBC, CTR. Our research focuses on finding leakage points in different modes of encryption including GCM to build hypothetical power consumption model for correlation power analysis (CPA) attack. CPA is simulated on AES-128-ECB in PIC18F4520 which yields secret key extraction in 2346 traces. Algorithmic level countermeasures for Counter mode and GCM mode are also presented. Proposed Counter and GCM mode implementation in FPGA yields 0.179% and 6.66% area overhead respectively. Authentication structure of proposed GCM is tolerant against fault injection attacks and propagates error with high probability. Single bit modifies approximately 51% bits in subsequent multiplications and disturbing the Tag by 48%.

To demonstrate the advantages of this combined measurement we chose a well-known gasochromic system. For testing the benefits and limitations of the concept, we used a phenol red based film with known sensitivity to CO2. Getting in contact with CO2 the phenol red based sensitive layer shows changes in absorption spectra and in contact potential difference (CPD). Due to the combination of both measurement techniques the influence of temperature and humidity, which is always a challenge in gas detection, can be identified and eliminated. We see different signal behaviour of the two measurement methods at humidity and temperature changes. In dry conditions the optical signal response towards CO2 is reduced, whereas the electrical signal is increased. Whereas the optical signal response is strongly dependent on the temperature, the electrical signal seems to be independent. These reactions look promising for future gas sensor applications in the field of gasochromic sensor dye evaluation.",

This increase is due to the active presence of social media in these mobile devices. The convergence of social media and mobile communication networks generates a considerable amount of trending media contents (e.g., texts, audio, videos, and images) on the Internet while exchanging or sharing contents. However, while exchanging messages or trending contents through social networks, there is a serious concern to identify whether the contents or the images are real or belong to the claimed context using associated descriptive tags. In this paper, we propose a collaborative analysis model to identify if any trending image is altered or modified, and whether the content used to describe it is actually accurate. It is a challenge to provide the desired trending media content in a short time from the vast amount of trending images on the social networks. Online social network environment is heterogeneous in nature, which demands computational Intelligent (CI) techniques to deliver the required media content in an acceptable time to the users. To this end, a collaborative search algorithm is used to utilize the descriptive tags, and user interaction history. The collaboration of tags powers the investigation of a trending images. Accordingly, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed model by performing experiments on the online collected data set using the proposed collaborative analysis model.",

In order to achieve these benefits we have to face the challenges of high practical relevance during application. We deploy and evaluate the concrete example of a fence monitoring task to reveal how our distributed event detection system is able to perform under real application conditions. The challenge is to bring both opposing aspects—high event detection accuracy and long service life—into one applicable ubiquitous system. If sensor nodes compose parts of events cooperatively, a comprehensive event assessment with low energy demands is possible. We propose a classifier based distributed event detection system consisting of two frameworks. The evaluation framework delivers a classification model and enables the theoretical evaluation of a given training set. The distributed event detection framework subsequently applies the classification model to assess, filter and classify events within the network. We evaluate our system by training and detecting events with our WSN composed of 49 nodes which are integrated in construction site fence elements. We compare four different data application scenarios with varying data processing concepts and varying network sizes to analyze the resulting communication load as well as the system lifetime. We compare the results of our evaluation framework with the results of our application to show that the evaluation framework reflects the real world deployment results in a credible way. We show the full applicability of our approach by comparing the resulting increased event detection accuracy against our previous work. Compared to other information fusion scenarios, our distributed event detection system reduces energy consumption beyond a communication distance of two hops which yields a prolonged lifetime of the network while additionally achieving an improved event detection accuracy.",

abstract = "Soft subspace clustering algorithms have been successfully used for high dimensional data in recent years. However, the existing algorithms often utilize only one distance function to evaluate the distance between data items on each feature, which cannot deal with datasets with complex inner structures. In this paper, a composite kernel space (CKS) is constructed based on a set of basis kernels and a novel framework of soft subspace clustering is proposed by integrating distance metric learning in the CKS. Two soft subspace clustering algorithms, i.e., entropy weighting fuzzy clustering in CKS for kernel space (CKS-EWFC-K) and feature space (CKS-EWFC-F) are thus developed. In both algorithms, the prototype in the feature space is mapped into the CKS by multiple simultaneous mappings, one mapping for each cluster, which is distinct from existing kernel-based clustering algorithms. By evaluating the distance on each feature in the CKS, both CKS-EWFC-K and CKS-EWFC-F learn the distance function adaptively during the clustering process. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms in general outperform classical clustering algorithms and are immune to ineffective kernels and irrelevant features in soft subspace.",

abstract = "Patent data provide technological information essential to define strategies and decisions in the context of firm innovative processes. At present, information regarding patents is usually represented and stored in large databases. Information from these databases is commonly retrieved in the form of files with a CSV- or XML-based codification but with little semantics that enable the inference of further relationships among patents. In these databases, each patent is associated with a technological field by a code. Although the codes assume a hierarchical classification approach, inclusion/subsumption relationships are not explicitly specified such that computers can process them automatically. In recent years, ontologies have been proven to facilitate the exchange of information between people and systems. In this context, the Web Ontology Language (OWL), whose formal semantics are based on description logics, has become the most widely used language for the representation of ontologies. Certain patent ontologies have already been developed in OWL to benefit from the semantics of patent information. However, none have fully exploited the information that can be derived from the formal representation of patent code classification hierarchies through description-logics-based reasoning. This paper presents an approach to automatically translate the hierarchies found in the patent classification codes into concept hierarchies. This proposal also enables the automatic inference of implicit knowledge based on reclassification techniques and relationships between different application domains without changing the applications that make use of patent information. Several examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposal and how it can assist firms in patent information management.",

The optimal operating temperature was determined to be ca. 350°C and so easily within the range of a MEMS based SOI CMOS substrate. The response was sensitive to significant changes in ambient humidity, but was found to have low cross-sensitivity to CO, hydrogen, methane, and acetone even at much higher ppm levels. We believe that these tungsten oxide gas sensors could be exploited in harsh applications, i.e. with a low oxygen (lean) environment often associated in the exhaust gases from combustion systems.",

In this article, we propose a big-data-driven approach named TOLA for online learning evolution to discover students’ learning pattern and guide courses improvement. Specifically, topic feature is extracted from MOOC forum through Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which is incorporated with other hybrid features. Through experiments, TOLA exhibits good performance in terms of complexity, efficiency and accuracy, facilitating the improvement of the quality of online education.",

Different types of research methodologies have been proposed to solve this problem; hence, there are varied solutions. Most of the work on OSNs has focused on trust, distrust to detect and preventing these types of attacks. Some researchers have found that a suspected node can generate private/public keys to prevent its identity from being stolen by an adversary; however, they have not explained how these keys are generated and managed. We propose a new and efficient centralized key management protocol to prevent Sybil attack and to provide a secure communication service among users in OSNs. The core tenet of this method is the existence of a ‘roadblock’ that any user intending to join a group must go through, which includes a task that only a human user can accomplish. Hence, automatically controlled accounts are prevented from joining, and the group will consist only of users that have been confirmed as genuine. The mechanism is very effective in recognizing bot accounts, which enables it to guard the network against malicious behavior by fake accounts.",

Further, a centralized Suboptimal Traffic Engineering (SOTE) solution is proposed by employing Lagrangian dual decomposition on the COTE problem, to ensure a resolution in polynomial time. Finally, a Distributed Greedy Traffic Engineering (DGTE) method is proposed to ensure fast convergence to the dynamic changing network behavior and to improve scalability.

abstract = "This work addresses a unique data fusion problem in Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) arising from Human Factors (HF) considerations. Typically, a VCPS message intended for human drivers is composed of many data elements (DEs), and different messages can be fused by the sender before transmission e.g., by eliminating identical (or redundant) DEs in order to save transmission bandwidth in the wireless network. Still, not all distinct DEs can be received properly due to the limited transmission resources available to the sender and/or transmission errors. Subsequently, some of the messages intended for a driver cannot be delivered. On the other hand, a partially delivered message may still be beneficial (in terms of generating some utility) to a driver. More specifically, when considering HF, the DEs can be grouped into two distinct parts: essential and auxiliary. While a partially reconstructed message missing even a single essential DE fails to produce any benefit (or utility) for a driver, each auxiliary DE can independently produce an additional utility so long as all the essential DEs of the message are also available. In this paper, we deal with a new Driver-in-the-Loop Data Fusion Problem (DDFP) with the primary issue being: given a list of out-going messages and a limit on the number of DEs that can be transmitted, how does the sender choose which DEs (each carrying a different utility) to transmit, in order to maximize the system-wide utility at the receiver. We formulate DDFP mathematically, and prove it to be NP-Complete. We study DDFP in both ideal and lossy communication networks, and propose several efficient algorithms for them. Besides the Single-Sender-Single-Receiver model, we also look into DDFP in Multiple-Sender-Single-Receiver and Single-Sender-Multiple-Receiver models with several practical considerations. Numerical results from large scale simulations are also presented.",

We address the following three fundamental, non-trivial issues and associated challenges: (1) how to dynamically allocate Wi-Fi bandwidth within each AP’s coverage; (2) how to dynamically allocate cellular bandwidth subject to data usage limits; and (3) how to jointly optimize the solutions to the former two issues. In particular, we focus on a new optimization problem called On-road Video Delivery (OVD) with integrated heterogeneous networks. Our whole objective is to maximize the system-wide User Experience Index (UEI), which is a performance metric used to evaluate the user experience of such on-road video services. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that focuses on on-road video delivery with both cellular and Wi-Fi networks. We prove OVD to be NP-Complete and propose two efficient solutions to deal with the above issues. We also design an online version of one proposed algorithm by considering the dynamic arrival of users.

We offer a structured approach to the application of the platforms that underpin GaaP, encompassing not only their technical architecture, but also the other essential aspects of market dynamics and organisational form. Based on a review of information systems platforms literature, we develop a Platform Appraisal Framework (PAF) incorporating the various dimensions that characterise business models based on digital platforms. We propose this PAF as a general contribution to the strategy and audit of platform initiatives and more specifically as an assessment framework to provide consistency of thinking in GaaP initiatives. We demonstrate the utility of our PAF by applying it to UK Government platform initiatives over two distinct periods, 1999–2010 and 2010 to the present day, drawing practical conclusions concerning implementation of platforms within the unique and complex environment of the public sector.",

A cloud platform enables to share resources among mutually distrusting CC clients and offers cost-effective, on-demand scaling. With the exponential growth of CC environment, vulnerabilities and their corresponding exploitation of the prevailing cloud resources may potentially increase. Although CC provides numerous benefits to the cloud computing tenant. However, features namely resource sharing and Virtual Machine (VM) physical co-residency raising the potential for sensitive information leakages such as Side Channel (SC) attacks. In particular, the physical co-residency feature allows attackers to communicate with another VM on the same physical machine and leak the confidential information due to inadequate logical isolation. Unlike encryption, which protects information from being decoded by unauthorized persons, SC attacks aim to exploit the encryption systems and to hide the occurrence of communication. SC attacks were initially identified as the main threat on multi-level secure systems i.e. OS, database, and networks. More recently, the focus of the researchers has shifted toward SC attacks in CC. Since the last level cache (L2 or L3) is always shared between VM, is the most targeting device for these attacks. Therefore, the aim of this article is to explore cross-VM SC attacks involving the CPU cache and their countermeasures in CC and to compare with the traditional SC attacks and countermeasures. We categorized the SC attacks according to the hardware medium they target and exploit, the ways they access the module and the method they use to extract confidential information. We identified that traditional prevention mechanisms for SC attacks are not appropriate for prevention of cross-VM cache-based SC attacks. We also proposed countermeasures for the prevention of these attacks in order to improve security in CC.",
