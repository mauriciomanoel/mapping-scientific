abstract = "This study constructs an approach to reproduce the real-time falls of humans, which uses a triaxial accelerometer and triaxial gyroscope to detect the occurrence of a fall, and an attitude algorithm to estimate the angles of each part of the human body, where Internet of healthcare things collects the information of each sensor, and a Bayesian Network deduces the next action. Inferential Bayesian probability could present more complete data of a fall to healthcare providers. Even if the data are damaged by the transmission network or equipment, the next action still could be deduced by Bayesian probability, and because the fall could be reproduced in a 3D Model on the client side, the fall occurrence is shown more intuitively, and could thus serve as reference for first aid.",

We make a number of observations, include the lack of publicly available IoT datasets that can be used by the research and practitioner communities. Given the potential sensitive nature of IoT datasets, there is a need to develop a standard for the sharing of IoT datasets among the research and practitioner communities and other relevant stakeholders. We then posit the potential for blockchain technology in facilitating secure sharing of IoT datasets (e.g. using blockchain to ensure the integrity of shared datasets) and securing IoT systems, before presenting two conceptual blockchain-based approaches. We then conclude this paper with nine potential research questions.",

abstract = "Progress in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is shaping more and more the healthcare domain. ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

This data can be badly expressed, understood, and exploited by other systems and devices. Additionally, the huge amount of connected objects embeds with resource-constrained devices (sensors, actuators, RFIDS, etc.) are also challenging. Consequently, semantic representation of both medical connected objects and their data becomes important. Furthermore, the semantic reasoning of this data requires the definition of diverse rules in order to provide adequate and efficient results. This paper suggests two main contributions. The first one focuses on the semantic representation of both the medical connected objects and their data by proposing a HealthIoT ontology. The second contribution is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of this ontology. In fact, an IoT Medicare system is proposed to evaluate the HealthIoT ontology.",

Also, a growing number of consumer electronic and mobile devices are becoming capable of taking the role of a health gateway, thus operating as a data collector for PHDs. In this context, we present a system that enables PHDs to share information in home networks and with the Internet based on a new Internet of Things protocol, namely the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is used along with the IEEE 11073 family of standards, which is the main exchange data model for PHD communication. We discuss how the proposed system can be integrated to other connected health systems, such as a Universal Plug and Play healthcare system. We detail how the CoAP communication model was adapted to the IEEE 11073 model. We also present a real PHD prototype and its evaluation results. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution, showing how its network overhead is around 50% lighter when compared to other protocols. Finally, we tested the proposed solution based on different scenarios, including a proof-of-concept integration with a service in the cloud, using different wireless physical interfaces.",

abstract = "This study examines the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) based innovations by urban poor communities. In recent years, IoT applications in social networking, smart cities and m-health have been explored, but the social acceptance of such applications remain largely unknown. A consumer segment on which IoT can have a major positive impact is the urban poor, where IoT can provide access to services such as healthcare, education and food security. However, to facilitate adoption among the poor, IoT-based innovations must incorporate the unique characteristics of this segment viz. low levels of technology awareness, social acceptance and consumer need. The Disruption of Things refers to the process of distribution the innovations that are based on IoT and replacing existing market leaders and prevalent systems. The study was conducted in four stages ‚Äì a literature review, a survey with the target users, interviews with experts (both technological and sociological) and a usability test with a prototype technology system. The results from the surveys, interviews and usability tests were used to develop a model for adoption of IoT-based innovations by the urban poor. The model identifies five sources of innovation ‚Äì nutrition, healthcare, employment, education and finances. Based on these sources, a participative design process is undertaken. Once developed the innovation must provide excellent service based on three parameters ‚Äì benefits (value of using the system to the users), support provided to the users, and training/instructions given to them regarding system use. Satisfied system's users would then be leveraged through three channels ‚Äì advertising, social media and word-of-mouth, in order to spur greater adoption of the innovation among the urban poor. Accomplishing these systematic processes would enable the Disruption of Things ‚Äì replacement of existing market leaders by an IoT-based innovation.",

Further, research challenges have been investigated to incorporate the lacuna inside the current trends of architectures to motivate the academics and industries get involved into seeking the possible way outs to apt the exact power of Internet of Things.
