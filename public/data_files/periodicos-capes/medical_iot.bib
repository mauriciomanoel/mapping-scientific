abstract = "With the soaring interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), some healthcare providers are facilitating remote care delivery through the use of wearable devices. These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

The requirement for self-health monitoring and preventive medicine is increasing due to the projected dramatic increase in the number of elderly people until 2020. Developed technologies are truly able to reduce the overall costs for prevention and monitoring. This is possible by constantly monitoring health indicators in various areas, and in particular, wearable devices are considered to carry this task out. These wearable devices and mobile apps now have been integrated with telemedicine and telehealth efficiently, to structure the medical Internet of Things. This paper reviews wearable health care devices both in scientific papers and commercial efforts. Methods MIoT is demonstrated through a defined architecture design, including hardware and software dealing with wearable devices, sensors, smart phones, medical application, and medical station analyzers for further diagnosis and data storage. Results Wearables, with the help of improved technology have been developed greatly and are considered reliable tools for long-term health monitoring systems. These are applied in the observation of a large variety of health monitoring indicators in the environment, vital signs, and fitness. Conclusions Wearable devices are now used for a wide range of healthcare observation. One of the most important elements essential in data collection is the sensor.

However, the previous studies have not yet been proven reliable. In addition, most of the products are designed for healthy customers rather than for patients with sleep disorder. We present a novel approach to classify sleep stages via low cost and noncontact multi-modal sensor fusion, which extracts sleep-related vital signals from radar signals and a sound-based context-awareness technique. This work is uniquely designed based on the PSG data of sleep disorder patients, which were received and certified by professionals at Hanyang University Hospital. The proposed algorithm further incorporates medical/statistical knowledge to determine personal-adjusted thresholds and devise post-processing. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is highlighted by contrasting sleep stage classification performance between single sensor and sensor-fusion algorithms. To validate the possibility of commercializing this work, the classification results of this algorithm were compared with the commercialized sleep monitoring device, ResMed S+. The proposed algorithm was investigated with random patients following PSG examination, and results show a promising novel approach for determining sleep stages in a low cost and unobtrusive manner.",

abstract = "Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) are deadly infectious diseases those transmit quickly through infected mosquitoes to human or from one infected person to another, resulting in substantial increase in worldwide morbidity and mortality rate. The symptoms of MBDs are almost similar to each other which makes it quite difficult to diagnose the specific disease. However, it is required to diagnose the patient for proper treatment and continuous monitoring of infected patients to control the infection of MBDs. Healthcare services based on fog-cloud assisted cyber-physical system are emerging as a proactive and efficacious solution to provide remote monitoring and early detection of infected users suffering from MBDs. Fog-cloud based cyber-physical system facilitates the alliance of devices in the physical space i.e. smart wearables, IoT sensors and smart cameras with cyber space to generate the required information. Afterwards, it uses cyber space to assimilate, analyze and share medical information amongst users and healthcare service providers. A novel system based on IoT sensors, cloud computing and fog computing is proposed to distinguish, classify and monitor the users infected with MBDs. The objective of this system is to control the outbreak of MBDs at an early stage. In the proposed system, similarity factor is calculated to differentiate among MBDs and then J48 decision tree classifier is used to classify the category of infection for each user. The alerts are instantly generated and sent on user’s mobile from fog layer in case of any abnormality. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used to sense the close proximity between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to monitor and represent the current state of the MBDs outbreak using close proximity data. The experimental evaluations of the proposed system resulted in high accuracy and low error rate to distinguish the MBDs and also provided 94% classification accuracy. The results also reveal that the TNA is an efficient tool to evaluate the state of MBDs outbreak using various statistical parameters. •Proposing a framework for distinguishing and classifying mosquito borne diseases.•Similarity factor is calculated to differentiate among mosquito borne diseases.•J48 decision tree classifier is used to classify the category of infection of each user.•In case of any abnormality, alerts are immediately generated on user’s mobile.•Temporal Network Analysis is used to represent the state of mosquito borne diseases outbreak.",

We investigated whether pattern matching of QRS loops in the 3-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) will improve the grouping of patients whose space-time electrical activity akin to each other, thereby assisting in clinical decision making. First, pattern dissimilarity of VCG QRS loops is qualitatively measured and characterized among patients, resulting in a 93×93 distance matrix of patient-to-patient dissimilarity. Each patient is then represented as a node in the network (or a star in the galaxy), but node locations are optimized to preserve the dissimilarity matrix. The optimization is achieved with a self-organizing algorithm that iteratively minimizes the network energy. Experimental results showed that patients’ locations converge as the representation error reaches a stable phase. The convergence is independent of initial locations of network nodes. Most importantly, 93 patients are automatically organized into 3 clusters of healthy control, LBBB, and infarction. Spatial coordinates of nodes (or patients) are evidently novel predictors that can be used in the computer-assisted detection of cardiac disorders. Self-organizing pattern matching is shown to have strong potentials for large-scale unsupervised learning of patient groups. •Thisdevelops a new self-organizing method to visualize pattern similarity between 3-lead VCG signals.•This work performs pattern matching of VCG signals to cluster subjects with similar space-time cardiac electrical activity.•This work derives a large-scale network by representing each subject as a node and optimizing node locations to identify community structures.•Self-organizing pattern matching shows strong potentials for large-scale unsupervised learning of patient groups.",

Even the simplest objects will become “smart” because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios.In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities.A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.",

In this paper, we build the case that 5G wireless technology, along with concomitant emerging technologies (such as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning), will transform global healthcare systems in the near future. Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other significant factors include the democratization of computing through cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (e.g., IBM Watson); and the commoditization of data through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled health revolution.",

Based on a new hybrid distance, novel Gaussian kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets (FRS) for HIS were constructed in our previous study. In real-world applications, with the deepening of cognition and improvements in technology, attribute values in an information system often evolve over time; in particular, there are three cases: when missing values are imputed, error values are corrected, and the values are coarsened or refined. This has posed challenges to developing efficient data analysis algorithms. In this paper, the changing mechanisms of the attribute values and fuzzy equivalence relations in FRS are analyzed. FRS approaches for incrementally updating approximations in HIS are presented. Moreover, two corresponding incremental algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experiments on eight data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an artificial data set show that incremental approaches can effectively improve the performance of updating approximations and not only significantly shorten the computational time, but also increase approximation classification accuracies.",

The medical IoT network monitors patient’s physiological data, which are aggregated to electronic health record (EHR). The medical big data that contains a large amount of EHRs are outsourced to cloud platform. In the proposed system, the patient distributes an IoT group key to the medical nodes in an authenticated way without interaction round. The IoT messages are encrypted using the IoT group key and transmitted to the patient, which can be batch authenticated by the patient. The encrypted EHRs are shared among patient and different data users in a fine-grained access control manner. A novel keyword match based policy update mechanism is designed to enable flexible access policy updating without privacy leakage. Extensive comparison and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms in the proposed system are efficient. Comprehensive analysis is provided to prove its security. •Anonymity and traceability of patient and medical node: In this system, anonymous identities are assigned for both patient and medical nodes, which is calculated from their real identities. If an anonymous patient is found dishonest or misbehaving, the trusted authority is capable to trace his real identity. If an anonymous medical node is compromised and utilized to launch attack in patient’s IoT network, the patient can also recover the node’s real identity.•Authenticated IoT key distribution: In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the messages transmitted in the health IoT network, the patient generates a symmetric key and sends it to all the medical nodes (in patient’s IoT network) in a privacy-preserving way. A key extraction auxiliary message is created by the patient to encapsulate the IoT key. Receiving the message, the medical nodes authenticate that whether the auxiliary message is indeed sent by the patient to prevent impersonation attack.•Authenticated IoT ciphertext transmission: After the IoT key is extracted by the medical nodes, the generated IoT messages are encrypted by the key and sends to the patient. To ensure the reliability of the source, the patient authenticates the IoT ciphertext and then decrypt it. A large amount of IoT ciphertexts may arrive at the same time period, our system also provides a batch verification algorithm to improve the efficiency.•Lightweight fine-grained access control: The e-health big data are encrypted and stored in a cloud platform. To prevent unauthorized data access, our system designs an expressive and lightweight fine-grained access control mechanism. The patient controls the electronic health record (EHR) encryption procedure, and defines an access policy such that the data users with specific attributes can decrypt patient’s medical files. The algorithms in the access control mechanism are lightweight constructions.•Flexible subset keyword match based access policy update: We design a novel access policy update mechanism based on keyword match. When the patient wants to change the access policy, he does not need to download all his EHR ciphertexts, decrypt them and re-encrypt them with a new access policy. In our system, the patient generates a privacy-preserving policy update query, which is sent to the cloud server. Then, the cloud server updates the match files without knowing the plaintext. A highlight is that the policy update process is keyword match based. If the patient wants to update the access policy of the EHRs that contains certain keywords, the query keywords are embedded in the policy update query. Only the access policy match files that contains these query keywords as subset keywords will be updated.",

To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access.

abstract = "The flexibility of new age wireless networks and the variety of sensors to measure a high number of variables, lead to new scenarios where anything can be monitored by small electronic devices, thereby implementing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Thanks to ZigBee, RFID or WiFi networks the precise location of humans or animals as well as some biological parameters can be known in real-time. However, since wireless sensors must be attached to biological tissues and they are highly dispersive, propagation of electromagnetic waves must be studied to deploy an efficient and well-working network. The main goal of this work is to study the influence of wireless channel limitations in the operation of a specific pet monitoring system, validated at physical channel as well as at functional level. In this sense, radio wave propagation produced by ZigBee devices operating at the ISM 2.4 GHz band is studied through an in-house developed 3D Ray Launching simulation tool, in order to analyze coverage/capacity relations for the optimal system selection as well as deployment strategy in terms of number of transceivers and location. Furthermore, a simplified dog model is developed for simulation code, considering not only its morphology but also its dielectric properties. Relevant wireless channel information such as power distribution, power delay profile and delay spread graphs are obtained providing an extensive wireless channel analysis. A functional dog monitoring system is presented, operating over the implemented ZigBee network and providing real time information to Android based devices. The proposed system can be scaled in order to consider different types of domestic pets as well as new user based functionalities.",

However, the energy hungry video transmission and slow progress in battery technologies have become a major and serious problem for the evolution of video technology in WBSNs. Therefore, the need arose to conduct research on sustainable, {"}Green{"}, i.e., energy-efficient and {"}Friendly{"}, i.e., battery-friendly technologies to cater the need of upcoming mobile and portable devices. The main challenge addressed in this research is how to increase the battery lifetime during on-demand Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video transmission from medical video server to base station in WBSNs. In order to overcome this problem, sustainable, Green and Friendly frame transmission algorithms are enunciated i.e. Lazy Algorithm (LA) and Battery-friendly Smoothing Algorithm (BSA) with analytical battery model. The proposed algorithms minimize transmission energy consumption, battery charge consumption and high current profile. These algorithms also prolongs the battery lifetime of those sensor nodes during video transmission. Experimental results demonstrates that BSA outperforms LA to minimize battery drain by improving its lifetime up to 19.8 %. However, the LA performs better than BSA in context of transmission energy saving up to 49.49 %.

It has had many positive effects, including medical access convenience, timeliness of service, and cost reduction. The speed of research and development in remote medical technology has been gradually accelerating. Therefore, it is expected to expand to enable various high-tech information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote medical services. However, the current state lacks an appropriate security framework that can resolve security issues centered on the Internet of things (IoT) environment that will be utilized significantly in telemedicine. Methods This study developed a medical service-oriented frame work for secure remote medical services, possessing flexibility regarding new service and security elements through its service-oriented structure. First, the common architecture of remote medical services is defined. Next medical-oriented secu rity threats and requirements within the IoT environment are identified. Finally, we propose a {"}service-oriented security frame work for remote medical services{"} based on previous work and requirements for secure remote medical services in the IoT. Results The proposed framework is a secure framework based on service-oriented cases in the medical environment. A com parative analysis focusing on the security elements (confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy) was conducted, and the analysis results demonstrate the security of the proposed framework for remote medical services with IoT. Conclusions The proposed framework is service-oriented structure. It can support dynamic security elements in accordance with demands related to new remote medical services which will be diversely generated in the IoT environment.

In particular, the reliability and effectiveness of the packets transmission will be directly related to the timely rescue of critically ill patients with life-threatening injuries. However, traditional fault-tolerant schemes either have the deficiency of underutilised resources or react too slowly to failures. In future healthcare systems, the medical Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring can integrate sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data techniques to address these problems. It can collect and send patient’s vital parameter signal and safety monitoring information to intelligent terminals and enhance transmission reliability and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a design in healthcare monitoring systems for a proactive reliable data transmission mechanism with resilience requirements in a many-to-one stream model. This Network Coding-based Fault-tolerant Mechanism (NCFM) first proposes a greedy grouping algorithm to divide the topology into small logical units; it then constructs a spanning tree based on random linear network coding to generate linearly independent coding combinations. Numerical results indicate that this transmission scheme works better than traditional methods in reducing the probability of packet loss, the resource redundant rate, and average delay, and can increase the effective throughput rate.",

Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.",
