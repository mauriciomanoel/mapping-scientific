abstract={Lately, Internet-based solutions, brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computation and storage technologies, have been driving revolutionary approaches in innumerable domains, including the sensitive domain of healthcare. Indicatively, real-time diagnosis of medical issues, telemedicine, remote monitoring of patients, as well as computer-assisted smart transportation in case of emergencies, are anticipated as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) that can execute several applications of different criticality, thus necessitating mission-critical and non-critical peripheral components. Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system. The main cricalities anticipated in such systems are described, as well as open areas for future research are also identified.},

pages={239-243},
abstract={The authentication models are utilized among the various network based applications, between various homogeneous and heterogeneous network appliances, Internet of things (IoT) applications, Healthcare applications, etc. The authentication models relies upon the encryption models for the protection of data during the propagation of the keys over the communication media. A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm. The proposed model has been undergone various experimental scenarios, where it has been found improved than the existing model in the terms of bit difference, overall time and average time.},

abstract={With the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of IoT devices and sensors is increasing tremendously. This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility.},

In the proposed scheme a certificate based DTLS handshake takes place for mutual authentication between Smart e-Health Gateway and client. The end-to-end communication between client and medical sensors is susceptible to replay and DDoS attacks, and the communication is made secure by ensuring all requests to the medical sensor are sent through the Smart e-Health Gateways in the fog layer. This model not only makes the communication more secure, but also reduces the load on the resource-constrained medical sensors.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology and infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Networked body sensing devices coupled with sensors in our living environment enable the real-time and continuous collection of information related to an individual's physical and mental health and related behaviors. Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques. A set of representative health applications that take advantage of such tools is also described. Finally, various challenges and opportunities that arise during the realization of smart and connected healthcare IoT are highlighted.},

abstract={It is expected that the Internet of Things (IoT) applications for medical services can be one of the most remarkable solution for taking care of aging population which is in the rapid growth. IoT consists of communications and sensors to accomplish purpose. In the diverse kinds of networks, wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN construction scheme that is consists of 4 operations, the clustered topology setup, mobility support, and transmission efficiency enhancement. As an auxiliary benefit, the proposed scheme achieves an energy efficient feature by reducing the number of total control messages. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed scheme remarkably improves the performance of WBAN.},

abstract={Massive medical and health care data has been generated, asking for research and development of cloud storage system. In order to improve its scalability and reliability at the same time shorten user access time, the multiple data replica scheme should be adopted and the proper location for each replica should be determined. In this paper, a multiple data replica placement scheme for cloud storage under health-care IoT environment is proposed. It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica. We have implemented the proposed scheme based on CloudSim and have done performance evaluation. Simulation results have shown that it can not only improve user access time and promote load balance but also enhance system scalability and reliability.},

There are several proposals for the implementation of NBIoT in the healthcare sector. NBIoT has been standardized and it has perfect compatibility with cellular platforms such as LTE. Therefore in the recent times, NBIoT is a good choice for healthcare related applications. However, the security measures and other system related challenges are the biggest threats for NBIoT. If these issues and challenges are handled properly it can be one of the most suitable and popular choices for the low power wide area implementations of healthcare.

Real time monitoring for analyzing vital signs to early detect or predict life threatening adverse events and frequent checks if the prescribed medicine is taken in time or not is required. In the existing system there is a need of another person for monitoring the patient condition. The proposed system eliminates the need of such manual observation of the patient. This system mainly consists of three components iMed box, iMed pack, Bio_patch which plays an important role. The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position. GSM is used to send and receive the information from the Doctor. Implementaton of this system will monitor the patient condition regularly and thus reduces sudden deaths.},

abstract={With the increasing availability of medical sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for personal use, it becomes feasible to maintain a repository of measurements for personal health conditions. Consequently, it is tempting to analyze in-progress diseases and to identify the development of potential diseases with the measurement repository. However, there are a number of technical challenges in developing such applications, modeling the relationships between diseases and acquired measurements, representing medical expertise in machine-readable forms, and high complexity in diagnosing disease methods. We adopt a semantic-based approach to resolve the first two challenges, and utilize the concept of cloud computing to tackle with the last challenge. In this paper, we present a cloud platform which provides a core set of functionality needed to enable personal medical diagnosis over the network. We believe that the presented platform provides a comprehensive core functionality needed for various types of personal healthcare IoT applications.},

abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},

abstract={Healthcare Internet of things (IoT) has been proposed as a promising means to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and access by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while prevent unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system which supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},

abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},

The integration of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) with power delivery infrastructure into Smart Grid (SG) will highly automate the production, distribution, monitoring and management of electric power, but will also introduce issues regarding consumer privacy. Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging scientific area with many practical applications to a vast variety of domains such as smart cities, home automation, autonomous vehicles, assistive technologies and healthcare. IoT is able to facilitate electric power management, by monitoring and controlling energy production and consumption, leading to significant savings. However, the IoT concept introduces several challenges and questions, with security, privacy and interoperability to be among them.

abstract={With the increasingly serious problem of the aging population, creating an efficient and real-time health management and feedback system based on the healthcare Internet of Things (HealthIoT) is an urgent need. Specifically, wearable technology and robotics can enable a user to collect the required human signals in a comfortable way. HealthIoT is the basic infrastructure for realizing health surveillance, and should be flexible to support multiple application demands and facilitate the management of infrastructure. Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device. This article discusses the background, advantages, and design details of the architecture proposed, which is achieved by an open-ended question and a potential solution. It opens a new research direction of HealthIoT and smart homes.},

title={Session Resumption-Based End-to-End Security for Healthcare Internet-of-Things},
year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={581-588},
abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},
