abstract={The effective integration of Community Medical Internet of Things (CMIoT) and the core technology IPv6 about the next generation of Internet will create a new pattern for the medical field. However, as a heterogeneous network system, the interconnection of different CMIoT components is the primary problem which needs to be solved. Traditional protocol conversion gateway in the Internet of Things only implements the packet format conversion. When the network environment changes, it is difficult to effectively implement the data path. We propose a CMIoT architecture with the assist of the communication auxiliary gateway, and design the simplified protocol message format under the premise of satisfying the functional requirements. At the same time, the CMIoT architecture model is built based on the Ptolemy II modeling environment and implemented in a community, and it is proved that the interconnection between the IPv6 network and the physical network can be realized more effectively.},

abstract={Forgetting our medical file while visiting the doctor or misplacing out on some important medical reports, regular visits to a remotely located hospital or inability to meet the doctor in an alarming situation - all these seemingly far-stretched complicated issues only get simplified using an IOT / ICT enabled system. The Internet of Things (IoT) can be described asa smart network of devices that are interconnected and embedded with sensors and software used to collect data and exchange information. The IoT has a variety of application domains, including health care as one of its chief research area. Our project eliminates the traditional system of preserving patient's medical health literature by introducing a portable web server which stores and synchronizes all kinds of patient information (reports, findings, scans, prescriptions, medical history, etc.) thereby making the system go paperless and hassle free. Further, this paper demonstrates the various functionalities implemented inorder to devise portable medical records and discusses on the scope of the core idea in the near future revolutionizing the field of healthcare.},

abstract={Internet enabled medical devices offer patients with a level of convenience. In recent years, the healthcare industry has seen a surge in the number of cyber-attacks. Given the potentially fatal impact of a compromised medical device, this study aims to identify vulnerabilities of medical devices. Our approach uses Shodan to obtain a large collection of IP addresses that will be passed through Nessus to verify if any vulnerabilities exist. We determined some devices manufactured by primary vendors such as Omron Corporation, FORA, Roche, and Bionet contain serious vulnerabilities such as Dropbear SSH Server and MS17-010. These allow remote execution of code and authentication bypassing potentially giving attackers control of their systems.},

abstract={Remote patient monitoring is essential for many patients that are suffering from acute diseases such as different heart conditions. Continuous health monitoring can provide medical services that consider the current medical state of the patient and to predict or early-detect future potentially critical situations. In this regard, Internet of Things as a multidisciplinary paradigm can provide profound impacts. However, the current IoT-based systems may encounter difficulties to provide continuous and real time patient monitoring due to issues in data analytics. In this paper, we introduce a new IoT-based approach to offer smart medical warning in personalized patient monitoring.

abstract={The recent advancements in technology and the availability of the Internet make it possible to connect various devices that can communicate with each other and share data. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows users to connect various sensors and smart devices to collect real-time data from the environment. However, it has been observed that a comprehensive platform is still missing in the e-Health and m-Health architectures to use smartphone sensors to sense and transmit important data related to a patient's health. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we critically evaluate the existing literature, which discusses the effective ways to deploy IoT in the field of medical and smart health care. Secondly, we propose a new semantic model for patients' e-Health. The proposed model named as `k-Healthcare' makes use of 4 layers; the sensor layer, the network layer, the Internet layer and the services layer. All layers cooperate with each other effectively and efficiently to provide a platform for accessing patients' health data using smart phones.},

abstract={The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) in medical health care is bound to generate the massive volume of heterogeneous data due to the millions of medical sensors attached with various patients' body. Therefore, to process such amount of heterogeneous data in real-time to take emergency actions in critical health situation is a challenging task. Therefore, to address such issues, we proposed Hadoop-based medical emergency management system using IoT technology, which involves a network architecture with the enhanced processing features for collecting data received from millions of medical sensors attached to the human body. The amount of collected data is then forwarded to the Intelligent Building to process and perform necessary actions using various units such as, collection unit, Hadoop Processing Unit (HPU), and Analysis and decision unit. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Sample medical, sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered to evaluate the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system efficiently process WBAN sensory data.},

The PMDs will essentially become part of the Internet of Things (IoTs) for medical devices providing almost seem less communication capabilities. This will expose the PMDs to new cyber threats.

This paradigm has the potential to revolutionize global industry and daily life. Healthcare is once such industry where the Internet of Things may provide great advantages to patients, care givers, and medical institutions. As the number of radio frequency emitters increases under this new paradigm public health and safety must also be taken into account. This paper explores the electromagnetic interference on implantable cardiac rhythm management devices caused by RFID interrogators. A standard electromagnetic compatibility test framework is proposed in order to diagnose the possibility of interference. Also, a mitigation method is proposed and tested. It is shown that the proposed method can reduce the incidence of clinically significant interference by nearly 60%.},

To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},

abstract={Nowadays, the market of healthcare is experiencing a rapid growth and is believed to be dramatically massive due to the upcoming global aging. The medical internet of things (IoTs) is endowed with expectation to fulfil the rigid demand, which requires the all kinds of digital medical devices linked and accessed to the internet to acquire all the parameters related to the personalized health, such as medical images, biochemical and biophysical parameters. The acquisition and transmission of the tremendous amount of biomedical information required high bandwidth and fast speed. The next generation communication technology-5G is capable of providing the suitable information infrastructure for the emerging IoTs application. The ubiquitous smartphone is the best information transfer station and considered as the point of personalized medical data acquisition. In this manuscript, we presented a medical dongle powered by the smartphone as a miniaturized electrochemical analyzer for blood glucose and uric acid monitoring. The family doctor can access the related biomedical information of his patient and give the precise, personalized and preventive healthcare consults. In addition, the accuracy and reliability of the proposed system were verified with good agreement as compared to the bulky biochemical analyzer in clinical use. In the emerging medical IoTs application, the proposed system is significantly promising solution since it united the biosensors, internet communication, information processing and family doctor together to provide the completed health care for each user.},

abstract={In this paper, we evaluate performance of an error control scheme in a multihop wireless body area network (WBAN) based on IEEE Std. 802.15.6, which is an international standard of WBAN. In the field of medical internet of things (m-IoT) systems, the WBAN is one of the most important key technology. As our previous work, we have proposed an optimal QoS control scheme that employs a multiplexing layer for priority scheduling and a decomposable error control coding scheme for WBAN. However, a two-hop extension supported in IEEE Std. 802.15.6 has not been considered. In this paper, we apply the two-hop extension, and then packet error ratio (PER), the number of transmissions and energy efficiency of our proposed system and the standard scheme are evaluated in that case. Numeral results show our proposed scheme has better performances than the standard scheme at many points. Particularly, our proposed system obtains over 3dB than the standard about PER.},

abstract={This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading from medical cloud storage to medical Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The medical cloud can distribute its own medical data to medical IoT devices via access points. Therefore, network disconnection can happen between the medical cloud and medical IoT devices when power/energy management in each access point is not efficient. This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance.},

abstract={The implementation of forensics in IOT has made investigations much easy then the traditional investigation. The mission in investigating an IoT crime is delivered by the dynamic nature of IOT solutions. Many predominant generation areas, which incorporates cloud computing, cellular gadgets, computer systems, sensors and RFID (Radio Frequency identification) technology are the combination of IOT. Forensic science is a mix of two Latin phrases: forensics and science. Forensic, relating to examination accomplished in public as trials in the ancient international were commonly held in public, it also consists of a robust judicial connotation. The second one termed as science, which is nowadays closely tied to the medical technique, also a systematic manner of obtaining knowledge. Collectively, forensic technology may be seen as the usage of the medical approaches and resources in crime solving. No matter its historical etymology, forensic science is something concrete but old fashioned. Branches of forensic science are rooted in nearly each department of technological knowledge and many different elements of current society. Due to its capability to discover nowadays it is identified as a critical part of the judicial world. At the same time as the key evidence in crook cases may additionally have come from witnesses or other subjective manner simply meaning forensic evidence, based as it is at the scientific method, is seen as more decisive than even eyewitness’ testimony. Especially in a judicial system like ours the accused is considered harmless till tested guilty, evidence gathered by forensic scientists is regularly utilized by both the protection and the prosecution in many of the judicial cases. The internet of things (IOT) accompanies both the central security and protection issues. Forensics for digital world although has been considered in every scholarly community and industry, portability crime scene investigation is phenomenally new an- unexplored. Crime scene investigation manages rigging and methods that work towards forensically stable recuperation of data and confirmation from our cell phones or mobile devices.},

However, recent years have witnessed the rapid growth and adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the advent of miniature wearable biosensors, and research advances in Big Data techniques for effective manipulation of large, multiscale, multimodal, distributed and heterogeneous data sets. These advances have generated new opportunities for personalized precision eHealth and mHealth services. IoT heralds a paradigm shift in the healthcare horizon by providing many advantages, including availability and accessibility, ability to personalize and tailor content, and cost-effective delivery. Although IoT eHealth has vastly expanded the possibilities to fulfill a number of existing healthcare needs, many challenges must still be addressed in order to develop consistent, suitable, safe, flexible and power-efficient systems that are suitable fit for medical needs. To enable this transformation, it is necessary for a large number of significant technological advancements in the hardware and software communities to come together. This keynote paper addresses all these important aspects of novel IoT technologies for smart healthcare-wearable sensors, body area sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and Big Data analytics. It identifies new perspectives and highlights compelling research issues and challenges such as scalability, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, and security, with various case studies.

It helps to enable preventive care and promote automation to reduce the risk of human error. In Indonesia, mother and child health care is still an important agenda of the government because the maternal and child mortality rate is still high. This paper describes a preliminary design of IoT applications for supporting mother and child healthcare program. We reviewed government regulations and guidelines to determine the needs and used them as a starting point. Then we defined the networks (topology, architectures, and platform), service and application, security and technology used in the design. This multi-platform system design constitutes portable medical devices with multiple sensors for collecting medical data and sending them to server. A mobile application works as mobile gateway for the devices and as a portal for accessing context-aware personalized information related to patient's condition. It also works as communication tool for teleconsultation. All of these functionalities are supported by service applications in a cloud so that patients and caregivers can access them from anywhere at anytime. This system is designed to enable remote monitoring and early detection by medical specialist and physicians at the clinic for mother and child preventive care.},

Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. In other words, the focus of this Blue Skies piece is to analyze the research challenges involved with developing a new class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are “resource and data aware”, and which are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data and data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models and data availability while executing – trading accuracy for execution time, etc.},

With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},

abstract={In hospitals and daily lives, a lot of patients have to carry certain medical equipment with them, this can include dragging it, wearing bag packs or strapping to themselves. Carrying such equipment is a necessity for recovery or survival, however, it is a cumbersome process. This hinders their daily activities and affects both, their physical and mental state. The objective of this paper is to tackle this problem. In this paper, we design a medical assistant robot which helps the patient in carrying medical equipment necessary for him. Our objective is to create a person following assistant which helps to drag this equipment and also provide support to the patient. This robot will take all the weight of the equipment and let the patient be free, and it will also provide support in terms of balance and assistance. It will make the patient independent and speed the recovery by improving their physical as well as mental state. It will autonomously follow the person using a unique color coded marker on them and avoid obstacles in its way. It will also function as an Internet of Things based medical reminder system.},

abstract={The widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart wearables, will play an important role in improving the quality of medical care, bringing convenience for patients and improving the management level of hospitals. However, due to the limitation of communication protocols, there exists non unified architecture that can connect all intelligent things in smart hospitals, which is made possible by the emergence of the Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). In light of this, we propose an architecture to connect intelligent things in smart hospitals based on NB-IoT, and introduce edge computing to deal with the requirement of latency in medical process. As a case study, we develop an infusion monitoring system to monitor the real-time drop rate and the volume of remaining drug during the intravenous infusion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for building a smart hospital by connecting intelligent things.},

System analysis is given about: Big Data market in Health Care, ways of Medical Information Systems development, and the direction of hospitals transition to new condition based on three “whales” (hybrid Cloud computing, supercomputer and data center). The Internet of Things ecosystem foregrounds some important aspects related to gerontology, genetics, biorhythmology, and gravitational biology. Sociological understanding of people's role in formation of the new high IT dependence reality allows to determine the main vectors of farsighted forecast. The technological evolution can be described as subsequent stages: distribution of IT — automation — Digital transformation and Internet of Things — Big Data analytics — Artificial Intelligence solutions — people connection to Augmented Reality — Context-as-A-Service — NBIC- and GRAIN-technologies — Humanity Plus. The essence of concept “patient” is changing. Patient transforms into an e-patient (all records about patient have been digitized) and then into Internet-patient with monitoring of health parameters within the Internet of Things surrounding people. Getting Augmented Reality patient is becoming a Digital patient. Augmented Reality methods are already being developed to treat patients.

abstract={The explosive growth in home, wearable, and wireless devices has not been matched by the growth in radio spectrum bands to accommodate them. The inter-networking of all of these devices known as “the internet of things (IoT)” is expected to have tens of billions of devices, mostly wireless, definitely incurring a coexistence or interference problem. The ubiquitous industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio band at 2.4GHz, in particular, one of the candidate band for IoT is heavily oversubscribed due to its unlicensed nature and could become all but unusable for priority systems in a densely populated area in the future at the present rate of growth of 2.4GHz transmitters and networks. In our study, the communications of the “last 100 meters” of an IoT network, i.e., from devices to an access point (AP) are considered. The interference suppression algorithms using the probability of false alarm PFA based methods, i.e., the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion and the localization algorithm based on double-thresholding (LAD) are applied to enhance the transmission bit error rate (BER) performances in various scenarios. Besides the traditional fixed threshold approach, an adaptive threshold approaches are proposed to enhance the performances in frequency selective fading channels. The simulation results show that the proposed methods excellently work even in an IoT network, which contains a large number of devices.},

abstract={Lately, Internet-based solutions, brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computation and storage technologies, have been driving revolutionary approaches in innumerable domains, including the sensitive domain of healthcare. Indicatively, real-time diagnosis of medical issues, telemedicine, remote monitoring of patients, as well as computer-assisted smart transportation in case of emergencies, are anticipated as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) that can execute several applications of different criticality, thus necessitating mission-critical and non-critical peripheral components. Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system. The main cricalities anticipated in such systems are described, as well as open areas for future research are also identified.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is becoming an integral part of today's solutions to critical issues. In this paper, we consider applications to the field of Zika outbreaks. Current solutions are limited to preventative measures such as spraying pesticides, destruction of mosquito breeding grounds, and avoiding the outdoors in the evening. However, these current methods have significant limitations because the geographic areas of Zika-carrying mosquito infestation are not known in fine-grained detail and testing for these locations is difficult. However, through crowdsensing techniques there are ways to better identify and narrow location determination. Devices such as smartphones are very common among the majority of citizens, and these devices can collect a plethora of information. This paper will focus on the use of crowdsensing techniques coupled with medical professional's diagnosis of Zika virus to impute possible vector data to provide more fine-grained and sophisticated location determination for Zika outbreaks.},

abstract={Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internet-of-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from scratch upon any changes in the configuration. Retraining of these algorithms requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose an approach for automatic retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. Our multi-view learning approach can be used in both online and batch modes. By applying the autonomous multi-view learning in the batch mode, we achieve an accuracy of 83.7% in activity recognition which is an improvement of 9.3% due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node. In addition to gain the less computation advantage of incremental training, the online learning algorithm results in an accuracy of 82.2% in activity recognition.},

IoT is used in many application areas like entertainment, medical, transport, agriculture, security, E-health, etc. even though there are many issues in IoT, one of the main issues during recent years is power management. The need for power management in smart homes focuses on reducing electricity cost and avoiding the high peak demand problems. For reducing electricity cost, another source of power can be used. The most preferable primary power unit will be solar power due to its availability in nature. This paper prioritizes the operation of power units. The proposed system consists of a controller, a photovoltaic system with battery, smart electrical appliance and smart communication network. The main use of the controller is to schedule the power units which may be solar power, battery power and grid supply. The proposed system uses Battery Energy Storage and Management (BESM) algorithm, which helped to reduce electricity cost. The smart controller works on BESM algorithm which picks up power units according to demand. There will be energy conversion from DC to AC so to improve quality of power, Selective Harmonic Elimination(SHE) method. This paper focuses on end user's income level and also the users' difficulty in managing power usage with time varying prices. The proposed system will consider environmental factors like room temperature, outside temperature and user habits like appliance usage frequency, appliance usage characteristics.},

abstract={The world of medical science is an emerging area that has accelerated with new technologies and this is the time when the vision of “The internet of things (IoT)” has turned into reality. IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors. The readings are shown in the form of graphs at IBM Watson IoT platform.},

abstract={The constant rapid growth and development of modern medical technology has resulted in an ever-growing demand for higher quality health monitoring systems. This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) considers interconnected things e.g., devices that consumes web services through the internet. Such kind of devices may vary from smart phones, smart TVs, medical devices or industrial devices. Thanks to the development of the ICT field, many standards supports the existence of the IoT devices: HTTP (Hypertext Transferring Protocol), MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), and EtherCAT, among others. The challenge is to allow these devices to communicate with cloud applications wherein the mismatch of communication protocols may occur. In this context, this research work presents an approach for connecting industrial Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) with the Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project cloud-based platform for publishing the factory shopfloor data. In this manner, the C2NET platform exploits data that is generated by industrial equipment for further actions, such as the optimization of production plans. The presented approach is tested within the deployment of web-service enabled controllers in a real industrial case known as the FASTory line.},

abstract={Medical education is the practice of being a medical practitioner, which varies considerably across the world. It is an active research area and has evolved tremendously in recent decades. The learning activities are commonly explored using patient cases. Among multiple medical education methodologies, Case-Based Learning (CBL) is considered as an effective methodology for small-group of medical students. Normally in CBL, the medical experts give the legacy fixed medical cases to students during their class for group discussions and their learning. In this practice, due to lack of beforehand practice or knowledge about that particular case, students hesitate to participate due to lack of confidence. Internet of Things (IoTs) is one of the well-known emerging technology and this hesitation can be dealt with creating real-world clinical cases using IoTs data and user-friendly environment for case-based learning. In this paper, an IoT-based CBL methodology is introduced, which records realworld patient data using IoTs, analyzes the imperative signs' data, creates the real-world clinical case for students practicing, and finally provides feedback to medical students. For case study purposes, our developed CBL tool is simulated on patient's data to realize the proposed methodology.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is the prelude to new technological innovation. It expands with different applications such as smart home, smart city, smart grids, smart car, smart healthcare and smart retail. The application of IoT in Healthcare system brings high value for the elderly, victims of chronic disease and those who require constant supervision. But there are many security issues in such application. Moreover, the medical devices used in the IoT enabled Healthcare System are resource constrained devices. So, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for authenticating such resource constrained medical devices. New algorithm for secure authentication and key agreement of the medical devices is also presented. This mechanism is resistance against various security attacks such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and Denial of Service attacks. Formal security analysis and the comparative study presented in this paper have proved that the proposed mechanism has many security features and highly secure among the already existing authentication mechanisms.},

abstract={With advances in Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent data sensors are being added to more and more devices that interact with human’s daily life in areas, such as medical services, smart grids, and financial services. IoT has made big contributions to data growth, requiring highly reliable data storage solutions. Storage area networks (SANs) are one of such solutions. To meet high reliability and availability requirements, SANs have to provide fault tolerance through redundancy to minimize or eliminate system downtime, thus preventing business discontinuity due to catastrophic events. Mesh is one of the common SAN topologies that have been applied to implement a fault tolerant SAN in practice. In this paper, failure behavior of a mesh SAN is modeled using a dynamic fault tree (DFT) in the case of perfect links, or a network graph in the case of imperfect links. Based on the constructed DFT or network graph model, reliability of the mesh SAN is evaluated using a binary decision diagram-based method. Results obtained from the case study can provide insights into the behavior of general mesh SAN systems, providing guidelines in the reliable design and operation of SANs.},

Information and communication security is of utmost important as medical devices or sensors deployed to monitor and collect personal medical data are highly vulnerable to malicious hacker attacks. Moreover, compliance with industry standards and government regulations mandate security and privacy protection of health and medical information.

The used frequency bands belong to the unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) frequency band. Thus, the parameters analyzed are: ToA (Time on Air), the bitrate and the Spreading Factor (SF) influence on performance level. From the obtained results, can be observed that with the increase of the SF parameter the time that the LoRa communication packet spends in the air is increased.

Digitizing currency can solve many problems in physical currency, such as the rampant counterfeit banknotes. Thus, not only the transparency can be cost-effectively preserved in store's ledger, but also customer's rights and interests can be protected while using the digital wallet. For the government, the regulation and auditing of financial transaction can be made simpler and more convenient for tax collection issue. Digitized transaction details can be much easier to audit by any computing device than manually audit the conventional ledger books. Furthermore, to make merchandise store to use digitized currency much easier, in this paper, we propose and deploy a Bitcoin collection supervision system called BPCSS based on blockchain technology with cloud databases for customers and merchandise stores.

abstract={The exponentially increasing number of Internet of things (IoT) devices introduces spectrum crisis to the widely used industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. Since IoT devices use heterogeneous radios with different bandwidths (e.g., 20 MHz for WiFi and 2 MHz for ZigBee), traditional interference avoidance methods, such as time-division multiple access (TDMA) and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA), have very low spectrum utilization. This is because TDMA and CSMA allocate the packets at time domain, without considering the bandwidth difference of different IoT radios. To address this issue, we propose PMC, a novel communication system that enables parallel multi-protocol communication to heterogeneous IoT radios (i.e., WiFi and ZigBee) within a single WiFi channel. Our extensive evaluations show that PMC achieves the throughput of up to 121.02 kbit/s and 319.76 Mbit/s for parallel communication to ZigBee and WiFi, respectively. Compared with TDMA and CSMA, the spectrum utilization of PMC is increased by 2.3 and 1.8 times, respectively.},

Stochastic computing is one potential solution for neural networks implemented in low-power back-end devices such as solar-powered devices and Internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we investigate a new architecture of stochastic neural networks with a hardware-oriented approximate activation function. The new proposed approximate activation function can be omitted while keeping the functionality well. Thus, it reduces the stochastic implementation complexity and hardware costs. Moreover, the new architecture significantly improves recognition error rates compared to previous stochastic neural networks with sigmoid function. Three classical types of neural networks are explored, multiple layer perceptron (MLP), restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The experimental results indicate the new proposed architecture achieves more than 25%, 60% and 3× reduction than previous stochastic neural networks, and more than 30×, 30× and 52% reduction than conventional binary neural networks, in terms of area, power and energy, respectively, while maintaining the similar error rates compared to the conventional neural networks.},

abstract={Providing low cost, reliable and efficient applications become the major pillars of Internet of Things. According to coverage range, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) take a prominent place at the expense of cellular networks based applications. Based on real-life measurements, we evaluate the LoRa (Long Range) coverage within Dakar peninsula covering a ground area of 83Km2. The measurements were performed with LoRa stations working in the 868MHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio bands using 14dBm transmit power and a spreading factor of 12. During our tests, we criss-crossed more than 40km in Dakar peninsula where we observed a good coverage as well as a good Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) up to a maximum communication range equals to 10km. Furthermore, the obtained average packet loss ratio is less than 30%.},

abstract={Advances in wireless communications, embedded systems, and integrated circuit technologies have enabled the wireless body area network (WBAN) to become a promising networking paradigm. Over the last decade, as an important part of the Internet of Things, we have witnessed WBANs playing an increasing role in modern medical systems because of its capabilities to collect real-time biomedical data through intelligent medical sensors in or around the patients' body and send the collected data to remote medical personnel for clinical diagnostics. WBANs not only bring us conveniences but also bring along the challenge of keeping data's confidentiality and preserving patients' privacy. In the past few years, several anonymous authentication (AA) schemes for WBANs were proposed to enhance security by protecting patients' identities and by encrypting medical data. However, many of these schemes are not secure enough. First, we review the most recent AA scheme for WBANs and point out that it is not secure for medical applications by proposing an impersonation attack. After that, we propose a new AA scheme for WBANs and prove that it is provably secure. Our detailed analysis results demonstrate that our proposed AA scheme not only overcomes the security weaknesses in previous schemes but also has the same computation costs at a client side.},

abstract={Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is assumed to provide health services by incorporating social networks and the internet of things (IoT). Although much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the m-Therapy framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.},

In developed countries, special attention is paid to monitoring and providing medical services to the elderly. In EU, the number of persons dealing with cardiovascular diseases is increasing. The number of persons needing special medical services depends on the economic and financial situation of each state. Romania is one of the poorest countries in EU, and this is reflected in health status of the population. This paper approaches the matter of improving the health of the population by presenting an e-Health system that has been implemented. The system in question was implemented by using the latest technologies and devices in the IoT (Internet of Things) field of research.

abstract={As the number of devices (things) connected to the Internet (Internet of things: IoT) is growing, achieving robust security and privacy (S&P) is becoming increasingly challenging. With the heavy use of medical things (MT), the S&P in the medical domain poses a serious issue that continues to grow. Due to the criticality and sensitivity of the data in the healthcare domain, ensuring the S&P of the Internet of medical things (IoMT) makes matters even more problematic. Lack of proper S&P in IoMT will not only leave patients' privacy at risk but may also put patients' lives at risk. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the S&P issues of IoMT. We also provide an approach to quantify IoMT risks and demonstrate how to assess risks in two IoMT devices. This work aims to increase the S&P awareness among IoMT stakeholders by enabling them to identify and quantify potential IoMT S&P risks.},

The proposed system will allow health care centers and doctors to securely and efficiently monitor patients' health at their homes using secure integration of medical devices and healthcare systems such as: body sensor networks, wearable devices, and the Internet of Things. The incremental patient data will be captured in real time and sent to the cloud/data center asynchronously to be analyzed and stored. Cloud based medical advice, then, can be provided to ensure accessibility of patient's data from anywhere and via almost any computing devices. The system will also be able to follow the progress of patient's recovery and determine if further care is necessary. In this system, the mobile communication is authenticated and stored in an encrypted database that is isolated from the Internet. The information security service will be provided by highly trusted cloud network that allows exchanging and sharing sensitive medical information.},

abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to - ake appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},

abstract={Indoor wireless communication using Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) is becoming a major need for the success of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud robotics in both developed and developing countries. With different operating conditions, interference, obstacles and type of building materials used, it is difficult to predict the path loss components in an indoor environment, which are crucial for the network design. It has been observed that the indoor path loss models proposed for western countries cannot be directly used in Indian scenarios due to variations in building materials utilized, floor plans, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a non-deterministic statistical indoor path loss model-Tata Indoor Path Loss Model (T-IPLM) which can be used for the 2.4-2.5 GHz, Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. To propose and validate, we have conducted several drive tests with different conditions such as busy office premise with obstacles, open office premise, corridor, canteen, and multistorey office locations, etc. We have also compared T-IPLM with popular path loss models such as ITU-R and Log-distance; T-IPLM matches closely with the drive test results as compared to other models. We believe that T-IPLM model can be used extensively to design accurate indoor communication networks required for regular WiFi communications and deployment and operations of IoT and cloud robotics.},

abstract={With the advent of the Internet of Things (IOT) technology, we will be expecting all the smart devices around us to provide various services in real-time. When this IoT technology is combined with Augmented Reality (AR), it will provide end users with real time as well as real world information. One of the prime advantages of AR combining with IoT is the bridging of the gap between the real and digital worlds around us. The ease of downloading features and scope of dynamic usage which AR brings to the smart devices and is expected to bring to the IoT is beyond human imagination! The education sector is expected to gain significantly using these technologies. The goal of technology in education is to make, learning easier, faster and more engaging for the students and to equip the instructor with powerful tools to provide more relevant courseware to their students. With introducing AR in education, we shall be able to provide contextually aware, more relevant, engaging and interactive courseware to the students, which would keep them interested in subject. Also, through IoT, the physical devices can provide context that the AR ecosystem would use for contextually aware rendering of multimedia content. Medical education domain is expected to gain significantly using IOT and AR. It is also observed that the training in the areas of equipment maintenance could gain significantly by applying these technologies judiciously. For eg. The conventional software virtual lab solution does not provide a real feel of performing an experiment. However, using IOT and AR technology, a sensor enabled Hardware based real lab environment can be created for performing the volumetric analysis experiments in chemistry by using WATER instead of Chemicals. C-DAC has developed few AR products in education domain - AR Board, AR Book and AR Game. AR Board is a virtual writing board on which a user can write with a laser pointer. It uses projection based AR Technology by creating a virtual env- ronment for contextual information presentation, and facilitates real-time interaction with the content. AR Book is a standard book that has been instrumented with AR markers printed, which when scanned would show augmented, 3D interactive content, videos, audio and animations contextually, on a printed book, thus adding new dimensionality to it. AR Game is a game based learning mobile application that can be used by students for learning through playing, and for evaluating their knowledge. The technology of these products has been transferred to industry for their further development and proliferation to various educational institutes.},

abstract={Beginning with the recent availability of wireless medical sensor prototype and growing, the need for E-health care application record databases, we analyze the requirement of a unified communication framework over a fifth generation network. The introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) and latest developments or improvements in E-health, pointed towards the fifth generation (5G) paradigm of health care application and services. This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data. Further, we propose a protocol stack for 5G-CCN WBAN to provide a secure, efficient and reliable E-health application services to meet the required needs of the current IP protocol stack and IoT devices.},

Healthcare management is one of the most promising applications of Information Technology. In the existing system patient is monitored using bedside monitoring station with wired sensors, which makes the patients to be periodically monitored by doctors/nurses. It is impossible to collect data for wider range and coverage of wireless network is not available. This paper proposes a cooperative approach for an automated Healthcare Monitoring System which uses sensors to measure various parameters of the patient like temperature, pulse and body movement using wireless communications. The patient's status will be recorded and stored on the cloud.

abstract={Ageing populations and the increase in chronic diseases all over the world demand efficient healthcare solutions for maintaining well-being of people. One strategy that has drawn significant research attention is a focus on remote health monitoring systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This concept can help decrease pressure on hospital systems and healthcare providers, reduce healthcare costs, and improve homecare especially for patients with chronic diseases and the elderly. This paper explores the use of IoT-based applications in medical field and proposes an IoT Tiered Architecture (IoTTA) towards an approach for transforming sensor data into real-time clinical feedback. This approach considers a range of aspects including sensing, sending, processing, storing, and mining and learning. Using this approach will help to develop useful and effective solutions for pursuing systems development in IoT healthcare applications. The result of the review found that the growth of IoT applications for healthcare is in areas of self-care, data mining, and machine learning.},

abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered a- d relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},

abstract={The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting every single object to the Internet with the purpose to automate every aspect of daily life. The IoT relies heavily on wireless low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) that collect information from the physical world and send the measurements to data aggregation and processing nodes. Most LLNs operate in the non-licensed industrial, scientific, and medical radio band, which is shared by a considerable number of systems. Coexisting wireless systems cause interference to each other, limiting their achievable performance. Multichannel communications enable frequency diversity, which in turn provides robustness against interference as well as increased network capacity. There is a considerable interest in multichannel medium access control (MAC) protocols for LLNs, including an evolving standard for the MAC layer of LLNs. In this paper, we review the latest advances in the topic and introduce a new classification framework for multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs. While our framework builds on previous review and classification studies, it adds aspects of a MAC protocol that reflect its interactions with the surrounding network stack. Seeing the resource constraints of the LLN devices, the study of such interactions-which is missing in prior classification efforts-can be the key for improving future designs. Relevant protocols published since 2006 are discussed and classified using the presented framework, including the recent multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs, such as the latest version of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for time slotted channel hopping.},

abstract={The idea of making use of the metal zipper on the handbag to serve as an off-body antenna is proposed, and the simulations together with measurements have been carried out. The feeding point can be located at the bottom of the zipper, and to be more specific, around one of the teeth. The excitation at certain tooth of the zipper would bring variations in the reflection coefficients as well as the radiation patterns. No matter the zipper is totally closed, quarterly opened, half opened, or is even totally opened, the antenna can operate with acceptable performance, though the common status of the handbag zipper is closed. Thus, it is to some extent reconfigurable, especially for radiation patterns. A fractional bandwidth of 4.92% at 2.44 GHz of the industrial, scientific, and medical band with a gain of about 5 dBi has been achieved. The impact of the human body has been evaluated. It is noticeable but affordable. The measured results indicate reasonable agreements to that of the simulations in both the matching performance and the radiation feature for the zipper antenna, which seems to be a promising candidate for body-centric wireless communications and the Internet of Things.},

abstract={Telemonitoring of diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) signal in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) hold the promise to be an evolving direction in personalized medicine. The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care especially for the respiratory diseases. However, when design such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency and etc to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data-acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different with the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps towards these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in the time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi. In order to satisfy the requirements of applications of personal medical care in WSNs and IoT, this study proposes an approximated $l_0$ (AL0) norm based method to search the solution via the gradient descent method, then projects the searched solution to the reconstruction feasible set. Meanwhile, this study adopts a new wavelet threshold (NWT) based method to denoise the electrocardiographic (ECG) interference. Experimental results are provided to testify the performance of the proposed methods.},

Medical device hacks are slowly becoming a reality and it becomes more critical than ever to defend and protect these devices from security attacks. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using machine learning models to efficiently determine attacks targeted on a medical device.

This makes it even harder to match personal data from incoming devices. This paper proposes a traceability route formation using a network graph based on techniques such as tuple of inputs and the Büchi automaton. This enabled the work to provide proper trace routes for the personal data from the originating source to the destination, which can be a health information system (HIS).

abstract={Healthcare Internet of things (IoT) has been proposed as a promising means to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and access by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while prevent unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system which supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},

In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes. The system is flexible and can incorporate more policy rules, professionals, and data classes.},

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the health-care sector through remote, continuous, and non-invasive monitoring of patients. However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.},

abstract={Wireless power transfer (WPT) is an old subject, introduced for the first time by Nikola Tesla in the twentieth century [1]. His patent proposal was based on the magnetic resonance of two coils to distribute large amounts of energy to distant places of consumption. The subject returned to the mainstream in the last decade due to the exponential growth in the number of electronic devices. Currently, the main goal is to achieve ubiquity of WPT with the consolidation of the Internet of Things (IoT). How to supply the energy necessary to operate this huge network of gadgets is still a problem waiting for a solution. Three main aspects must be considered when outlining the powering strategy of those forthcoming technologies: small physical volume, high energy efficiency, and compatible aesthetics. Other emerging topics have similar requirements, such as battery-less medical implanted devices, remote contactless, and radio frequency identification (RFID), to mention a few. Current techniques envisaged for WPT are founded on the transmission of energy by electromagnetic fields. Both far- and near-field strategies have been studied; however, in this paper we focus on the latter, specifically on inductive power transfer (IPT). A typical IPT system can be thought of as an aircore transformer connected to a load and a source by passive networks. These networks provide the necessary impedance transformation for maximizing the power transfer from source to load. The key to achieving high transfer efficiency is to minimize the losses on the passives, including the transformer inductors. Moreover, the magnetic coupling factor between the inductances should be as high as possible. In this article, we review the modeling of a typical IPT link and discuss the criteria for maximizing the power transferred to the load as well as the power transfer efficiency. In addition, we report application-specific IPT designs and characterization which have been addressed by Brazilian- researchers.},

abstract={Electrocardiography (ECG) devices are considered essential medical tools for detecting and preventing cardiovascular diseases. These devices are used to obtain information about the structure and function of the human heart. Given the various medical uses of the information from ECG devices, it is essential that these devices provide accurate information about the heart in a precise manner. Although many advances in ECG devices have been made over the years, the literature reveals not only limitations in conventional devices but also highlights how the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to improve medical applications in ECG devices. This paper reviews previous works on ECG devices to identify their limitations as well as provides some insights into the development of IoT-based ECG devices.},

abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback. This data, which pertains to bicortical drilling conditions, will provide teaching surgeons and their surgical residents evaluation tools beyond those currently available.},

Starting from the overall scenario of this service, the paper proposes an HM oriented Sensing Service scenario (HM-SS) with the aim to improve the service quality and accessibility, considering the increasing interest for this service which comes not only from large medical facilities but also from small ones (clinics, general practitioners) where the outpatient setting is specific.

abstract={Recent developments in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have already put a huge impact on the medical and health sector. Thus, the patient treatment can be performed in more efficient ways compared with traditional methods. Secure identification is a key system requirement for patients to acquire these health related services. Fast and convenient identification is important in the case of critical and elderly or disabled patients who required frequent health services. In this paper, we are presenting concept of the Naked environment where patients can get health services from smart and intelligent surroundings of hospital without using explicit gadgets. Patients would have direct interaction with the environment and get identified through it. We propose a biometric based authentication scheme for the Naked hospital environment that also protects the patients identity privacy. In addition, we show that this authentication scheme can resist various well known attacks such as insider attacks, replay attacks and identity privacy among others.},

The medical industry has many complex and strict environmental control process (e.g., temperature and humidity) to ensure quality control and regulatory compliance over the transport of medical products. The sensor devices monitor the temperature of each parcel during the shipment to fully ensure GDP regulations. All data is transferred to the blockchain where a smart contract assesses against the product attributes.

In IoT vision, each and every 'thing' has the ability of talking to each other that brings the idea of Internet of Everything in reality. Numerous IoT services can make our daily life easier, smarter, and even safer. Using IoT in designing some special services can make a lifesaver system. In this paper, we have presented an IoT enabled approach that can provide emergency communication and location tracking services in a remote car that meets an unfortunate accident or any other emergency situation. Immediately after an accident or an emergency, the system either starts automatically or may be triggered manually. Depending upon type of emergency (police and security, fire and rescue, medical, or civil) it initiates communication and shares critical information e.g. location information, a set of relevant images taken from prefixed angles etc. with appropriate server/authority. Provision of interactive real-time multimedia communication, real-time location tracking etc. have also been integrated to the proposed system to monitor the exact condition in real-time basis.

Taking advantage of the capabilities of modern heterogeneous System-on-Chip devices to run cores in asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) configuration, we developed a methodology to showcase dynamic updating of real-time applications in a novel secure way when executing on a Xilinx ZYNQ-based platform. As an exemplary implementation we demonstrate a bio-signal monitoring use case that reads accelerometer data to determine if a person has fallen, while a distant medical management system can dynamically perform firmware updates. Even sophisticated code injection or reuse attacks can be subverted with the proposed defenses that ensure a practically isolated environment for the critical firmware with negligible overhead to the device in terms of performance and cost.},

abstract={Wearable Internet-of-Things (WIoT) environments have demonstrated great potential in a broad range of applications in healthcare and well-being. Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements. We conclude the paper with a list of insights into what capabilities constrained WIoT platforms should provide developers so as to make the inclusion of data-driven security primitives in such systems.},

abstract={Recently, various types of medical applications of electromagnetic waves have widely been investigated and reported. Typical recent medical applications include: (1) Information / Wireless power transfer: - Wearable or implantable vital data sensor / monitor - Wireless telemedicine / Mobile health system using IoT (Internet of Things) - Wireless capsule endoscopy (2) Diagnosis: - High intensity MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) - Microwave CT (Computed Tomography) for cancer detection - Wireless sleep monitor / ECG (electrocardiogram) monitor (3) Treatment: - Thermal therapy (hyperthermia, ablation, etc) - Wireless brain stimulator - Surgical device (coagulation device, microwave knife, etc) In this presentation, some practical medical applications of electromagnetic waves are introduced. Firstly, a wearable dual-mode antenna for vital data monitoring systems is presented. A key technology for the antenna is body-centric wireless communications. Secondly, an X-band antenna for a microwave sleep monitor is demonstrated with human-body phantom experiments. A “dynamic” phantom played an important role for the study. Thirdly, a coaxial-slot antenna and an array applicator composed of several coaxial-slot antennas for minimally invasive microwave thermal therapy are overviewed. A few results of actual clinical trials by use of coaxial-slot antennas are demonstrated from a technical point of view. Finally, a few different types of surgical devices using high power microwave energy are introduced. Heating characteristics of such microwave surgical devices are evaluated by numerical calculation as well as experiments using phantoms, meat and animals. In addition, some future works are briefly discussed.},

abstract={The advances and fast spread of mobile devices and technologies, we witness today, have extended its advantages over medical and health practice supported by mobile devices, giving rise to the growing research of Internet of Things (IoT), especially the e-Health field. The features provided by mobile technologies revealed to be of major importance when we consider the continuous aging of population and the consequent increase of its debilities. In addition to the increase of lifetime span of population, also the increase of health risks and their locomotive impairments increases, requiring a close monitoring and continuous evaluation. Such monitoring should be as non-invasive as possible, in order not to compromise the mobility and the day-to-day activities of citizens. Therefore, we present the development of a non-invasive optical fiber sensor architecture adaptable to a shoe sole for plantar pressure remote monitoring, which is suitable to be integrated in an IoT e-Health solution to monitor the wellbeing of individuals. The paper explores the production of the optical fiber sensor multiplexed network (using Fiber Bragg Gratings) to monitor the foot plantar pressure distribution during gait (walking movement). From the acquired gait data, it is possible to infer health conditions of the patient’s foot and spine posture. To guarantee the patients mobility, the proposed system consists of an optical fiber sensor network integrated with a wireless transceiver to enable efficient ubiquitous monitoring of patients. The paper shows the calibration and measurement results, which reflect the accuracy of the proposed system, under normal walking in controlled area.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technological paradigm that can connect things from various fields through the Internet. For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.},

abstract={A number of governmental and non-governmental bodies are visiting the rural parts of India on a regular basis to provide quality health care facilities. But due to the remoteness of the areas, the follow up of patients has become a major challenge. In this work we propose an Internet of things based patient health monitoring system as a solution to afore mentioned problem. The system monitors vital health parameters of a patient and uploads the data to server using a software based gateway. The data is processed real-time and doctor is alerted when anomalies are detected. There is provision for bi-directional data flow, allowing the doctor to send clinical advice to the patient. The system was tested in a rural healthcare unit and real-time data was generated. The results were confirmed by qualified medical practitioner.},

abstract={Process management is practical in the state-of-the-art of Internet of things research. However, this has become a bottleneck in recent years since an extreme amount of heterogeneous items have to be recorded and traced with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. In a typical application of process synthesis management, each item will be involved with multiple processes but when those processes are interconnected, an extremely complex network emerges and has to be managed. Existing works on processing management systems, however, are always case-based and only focus on specific application domains. Thus, the general applied processing management model is rather limited. In this paper, we summarize the characteristics of the RFID application domains, and by abstraction, we propose an innovation of the RFID processing model. In this model, each RFID data were deemed as an operation record and all their processing services are logically interconnected and organized as a procedure graph. In addition, we abstract and summarize the basic RFID data processes into a few types. The advantage of this design is that the basic RFID data processing logic can be preprogrammed and in a real domain, the system can be dynamically programmed by automatically constructing the procedure graph nodes with those basic processes and mapping the interconnection logic according to the topology of the graph. As the last part of this paper, we designed a prototype system for medical instruments infection control to demonstrate our approach.},

abstract={There are many recent revolutionary advances in information technology that include: wireless communication, the spread of mobile devices, and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). IoT will have an important role in connecting almost everything (mobile devices, cameras, home appliances, healthcare devices, military equipments, ..., etc) to the Internet via different communication technologies such as Wi-Fi. This connection will have impact on many sectors of our life such as industry, economy, social life, and ICT sector. Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT. Then, we present the recent timing and fault Side Channel Attacks on cryptosystem implementations for the most secure encryption algorithms (AES, ECC, and RSA). Also, the countermeasures to protect these cryptosystems from such attacks are also presented.},

abstract={The recent proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and wearable devices has given rise to crowdsourcing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure threefactor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card, 2) password and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Burrows- Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. With the combination of high security and appreciably low communication and computational overheads, our scheme is very much practical for battery limited devices for the healthcare applications as compared to other existing related schemes.},

year={2017},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of variation in the time interval between consecutive heart beats. HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.},

To address these problems, a healthcare system (HES) framework is designed that collects medical data from WBANs, transmits them through an extensive wireless sensor network infrastructure, and finally, publishes them into wireless personal-area networks via a gateway. Furthermore, HES involves the groups of send-receive model scheme to realize key distribution and secure data transmission, the homomorphic encryption based on matrix scheme to ensure privacy, and an expert system able to analyze the scrambled medical data and feedback the results automatically.

abstract={The rapid advances in modern wireless technology opens the door for new applications using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In the medical field, staff members of a certain hospital are in need for a system that tracks where patients/medical staff/devices are at any given time. LoCATE, which is Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment, provides a near-real time tracking tool for medical systems using the existing 802.11 WiFi infrastructure. The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara® RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions. While implications for an IoT system such as LoCATE are wide-ranging; its primary objective is to provide an easy to use, low-cost solution to track the location of medical assets in real-time.},

abstract={The vision of future networking is that not only people but also all things, services, and media will be connected and integrated, creating an Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems aim to connect and scale billions of devices in various domains such as transportation, industry, smart home/city, medical services, and energy systems. Different wireless and wired technologies link sensors and systems together, through wireless access points, gateways, and routers that in turn connect to the web and cloud-based intelligence. IoT architectures make great demands on network control methods for the efficient management of massive amounts of nodes and data. Therefore, some of the cloud's management tasks should be distributed around the edges of networked systems, utilizing fog computing to control and manage, e.g., network resources, quality, traffic prioritizations, and security. In this work, we present adaptive edge computing solutions based on regressive admission control (REAC) and fuzzy weighted queueing (FWQ) that monitor and react to network quality-of-service (QoS) changes within heterogeneous networks, and in a vehicular use case scenario utilizing IEEE 802.11p technology.

abstract={Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global healthcare system. A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},

abstract={Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses. To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard.},

In the healthcare environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to physicians and patients as they can be applied to various medical areas (such as constant real-time monitoring, patient information management, medical emergency management, blood information management, and health management). The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment. In this paper, we discuss the security requirements of RFID authentication schemes, and in particular, we present a review of ECC-based RFID authentication schemes in terms of performance and security. Although most of them cannot satisfy all security requirements and have satisfactory performance, we found that there are three recently proposed ECC-based authentication schemes suitable for the healthcare environment in terms of their performance and security.},

This provides a set of services for both patients and their caregivers that support the full continuum of the multidimensional care approach of diabetes. The platform’s software architecture pattern enables the development of various applications without knowing low-level details of the platform. This is achieved through unifying the access interface and mechanism of handling service requests through a layered approach based on object virtualization and automatic service delivery. A fully functional prototype is developed, and its end-to-end functionality and acceptability are tested successfully through a clinician-led pilot study, providing evidence that both patients and caregivers are receptive to the introduction of the proposed platform.},

abstract={Machine to machine (M2M) communications enable autonomous communication between devices and are an integral part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper evaluates the feasibility of opportunistic M2M communication in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band and its coexistence with existing WiFi networks. Using a BMAP/G/1/K queuing model, we evaluate the duration and frequency of idle periods or “white spaces” in WiFi networks, that may be opportunistically used for M2M communication. Our results show that white spaces occur frequently and are sufficiently long to facilitate opportunistic M2M communications.},

abstract={With the advent of the Internet of Things, body-worn sensor nodes are continuously becoming more important. In case of bio-medical, rescue-worker or military applications sensitive data are often transmitted, requiring the need for encryption. The distribution of symmetric encryption keys is often an issue leading to security risks. Body-worn sensor nodes are generally employed in quickly varying channel conditions due to body movement. The radio-communication channel between such nodes is however reciprocal, allowing the extraction of an array of similar channel measurements at both ends of the link. These data can be used to build equal encryption keys at both link ends without the need for actual over-the-air key distribution. This paper studies the practical performance of an enhanced channel-based key generation system with a very short round-trip delay, allowing reciprocal channel assessment with increased accuracy. Measurements were performed using the new system and the results of the enhanced key generation are evaluated. Although the performance is slightly increased thanks to the shorter round-trip delay, the accuracy of the signal level detector still imposes limits.},

abstract={In this paper we analyze and discuss the coverage and capacity of Sigfox and LoRaWAN in a large scale urban environments covering 150 km2 in Northern Denmark. First, the study measures and analyzes interference in the European 868 MHz license free industrial, scientific, and medical band, creating a model for the interference. The measured interference in downtown Aalborg has an occurrence rate of 22 % and a generalized extreme value distributed power level. Next, the study compares the coverage of the two Internet of Things network solutions using the existing Telenor cellular site grid both with and without interference from the measured external sources. The study concludes that without interference, both LoRaWAN and Sigfox provides very good indoor coverage of more than 99 %. Furthermore, Sigfox and LoRaWAN can provide uplink and downlink failure rates of less than 1 % for the 95 percentile of the devices for all cells without external interference. Adding the external interference results in an outdoor coverage of 90-95 % and indoor coverage of 50-80 %. Finally, the uplink and downlink 95 percentile failure rate increases significantly to 50 % for LoRaWAN and exceeds 60 % for Sigfox.},

abstract={In this measurement study the signal activity and power levels are measured in the European Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band 863-870 MHz in the city of Aalborg, Denmark. The target is to determine if there is any interference, which may impact deployment of Internet of Things devices. The focus is on the Low Power Wide Area technologies LoRa and SigFox. The measurements show that there is a 22-33 % probability of interfering signals above -105 dBm within the mandatory LoRa and SigFox 868.0-868.6 MHz band in a shopping area and a business park in downtown Aalborg, which thus limits the potential coverage and capacity of LoRa and SigFox. However, the probability of interference is less than 3 % in the three other measurement locations in Aalborg. Finally, a hospital and an industrial area are shown to experience high activity in the RFID subband 865-868 MHz, while the wireless audio band 863-865 MHz has less activity.},

abstract={Traditional Chinese medicine is a time-honored medical science. With slight side effect and irritation, traditional Chinese medicine has successfully made its own way in strengthening, diagnosing and curing. But shortcomings still exist. Its teaching and diagnosing pattern with subjectivity has made it truly hard to standardize and systematize, citizens find it increasingly inconvenient to see a doctor, especially in area with dense population and poor medical condition, etc. However, with the rapid development of cyber techniques nowadays, projecting the theory of traditional Chinese medicine into cyber space, which is also called as cyber-enabled, would be very likely to solve these problems. We recommend a new therapy method, which we name as cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine. It would enable people to diagnose and cure disease by themselves. Sensors embedded in wearable devices could be used to continuously collect and transmit data, while terminator could analyze data and give diagnostic results and prescriptions. During the whole process, the idea of traditional Chinese medicine are considered and applied, which is the crux of our method. Cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine's advantages would be generally demonstrated in two aspects: first, taken copious factors into consideration, cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine would become more efficient and accurate, second, people could easily diagnose and cure diseases by themselves. Thus, everyone would have access to high-quality medical service without going to hospital. Besides, taking advantages of the Internet of things and big data, based on traditional therapy, adding into accurate data and efficient algorithm, this new method would promote traditional Chinese medicine, providing a new way for existing medical system.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Things once considered as ingredients to the science fiction movies are quickly becoming a reality. The future Internet will be capable of connecting & communicating with almost all physical and virtual objects around us to the existing Internet. The Internet of Things is a vision that entails connectivity among different physical and virtual objects in order to understand how the life would change when things, homes and cities become smart. In this sense, IoT is an integral part of the `future Internet' that counsels individuals, public and private organizations, research and educational institutes about how the `smart things' can be active participants in business, information and social processes by interacting with themselves and with the environment. Thus `smart things' are expected to exchange/process the sensed data, while reacting autonomously to the events with or without any human intervention and self configuring themselves. The application domain of IoT is spreading out over the time. To name a few, IoT would revolutionize fields such as telemedicine (or the future `medical tourism'), irrigation, smart buildings & industries, ecommerce, auto vehicle systems, monitoring & surveillance, etc. However, all these charismatic and pleasing aspects of IoT can be envisioned in reality only if a `well-defined' standard can be constituted that could deal with the complexity, size, security, privacy, time, cost, peaceful co-existence and better integration among the things/objects, and the socio-economic implications. This talk would brief, among others, the novel IoT architectures and enabling technologies such as WSNs, WMNs, MANETs, RFID, WPANs, LiFi, etc. that could deal with the mentioned challenges.},

abstract={Many Technology experts consider Internet of things as major step for the future endeavors that are going to happen in computer network field. According to CISCO, IoT can be considered as a situation or time where more things are connected to internet than human beings. Things represent the physical objects which are provided with unique identification numbers and their purpose is to collect and transmit the data which are relevant to the scenario in which things are placed. From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification. In RFID system, proper authentication has to be performed between RFID tags and RFID reader. In this paper describes a authentication scheme which performs authentication between RFID tag and RFID reader with help of a server which contains some pre shared information about tag and reader.},

Further, the applications of IoT in sensing the glucose level, ECG monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, wheelchair management, medication management and rehabilitation system are analyzed.

The introduction of medical IoT is not without security challenges. Hence, the security threats such as confidentiality, authentication, privacy, access control, trust, and policy enforcement are analyzed. The presence of these threats affect the performance of IoT, thus, the cryptographic algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) are used.

abstract={Wireless power transfer using near-field inductive coupling is the predominating technology to power up wireless devices such as radio frequency identification tags, sensors, and medical implants. Miniaturization is a new key requirement for the application in the internet of things and implantable medical devices. Realization of efficient RF power transfer using conventional techniques based on 900 MHz and 2.4GHz is difficult, mainly due to the relatively large wavelength in these bands. On the other hand, conventional inductive coupling is very inefficient as the device becomes very small, limited by the small coupling factor and operating frequency. In this paper, we utilize a multicoil transmitting (Tx) array to power up very small receiving (Rx) devices in the near field by boosting the power gain to a much higher level. The power gain boosting is achieved by operating the array close to its self-resonance frequency and optimizing the phase relationship of the array elements. To validate the proposed technique, we implemented a prototype printed circuit board (PCB) to power a 1 cm × 1 cm small Rx coil at a distance of 20 cm. To demonstrate the improvement on power gain, we designed a 3 × 3 Tx coil array composed of nine 3 cm × 3 cm elements, as well as an individual large Tx coil with the same dimension of the array for fair comparison. Measured results show that the transducer power gain can be increased by 16.4 dB with the proposed technique.},

abstract={This project describes the development of a gait shoe system that's capable to continuous monitoring the gait analysis by using the Internet of Things (IoT) or wireless system approach. The system consists of two bend sensors, one ultrasound sensor, Intel Edison, Minnow board, Bluetooth module, mobile application and a database system. Currently, gait analysis is carried out in a motion laboratory that provides a full analysis of the motion body segments using a super highly accurate computer. This method is expensive and not affordable for everyone, indeed it requires quite a lot of maintenances. Furthermore, gait analysis requires a specialist to conduct and examine the patients, which means patients have to pay a lot of visits to hospital just only to get a treatment and feedback from the doctor that resulted waste of time, energy and money. Thus, this project will introduce a new and advance ways solution in order to evaluate the gait parameters. In this project, it will focus on two types of gait parameters, which is plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. One of the bend sensors is intended to be place under the sole and another one is around the ankle. The ultrasound sensor it will be assembled at the side of the shoe. The advantages of the completed system are when both of these sensors recorded all the gait information the subject or the patient still can do the daily routine life without interruption. The designed gait shoe is also able to display results from the analysis and sent it directly to the medical specialist through database to the data center analysis or online monitoring and at the same time the patient also can monitor via mobile phone.},

Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-qu- lity expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology and infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Networked body sensing devices coupled with sensors in our living environment enable the real-time and continuous collection of information related to an individual's physical and mental health and related behaviors. Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques. A set of representative health applications that take advantage of such tools is also described. Finally, various challenges and opportunities that arise during the realization of smart and connected healthcare IoT are highlighted.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly important for traffic monitoring, medical treatment and other industrial applications. With the continuous development of the IoT, more and more “things” will be able to access to the IoT. Considering a large number of heterogeneous “things”, how to provide a unified access mechanism to the IoT is a fundamental and key issue. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT access architecture based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) and system on chip (SoC), which can provide a unified access to the IoT for a wide variety of low-speed and high-speed devices with associated extendibility and configurability. We have adopted IEEE1451.2 standard for this design and applied the proposed design to vehicle monitoring system. The results indicate that the system can provide good performance in practical application.},

abstract={In an environment that is only now addressing the security issues of medical devices as a constituent part of IT networks, a new wave of technological development is threatening to swamp healthcare. The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery. Making security the enabler of safe and protected data transfer, exchange, and use, is fundamental to using this technology.},

The importance of this specific ISM frequency band is increasing over the time as it is utilized by data acquisition from increasing number of sensors in IoT, industrial automation and logistics segment. As the number of network devices in ISM frequency band is rapidly increasing, the identification of technology limits is crucial for future deployment of IoT networks in areas with a high interference potential. The interference is the main cause of the degradation in communication stability among IoT devices and decreasing QoS (Quality of Service).

abstract={Human-centered Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications utilize computational algorithms such as machine learning and signal processing techniques to infer knowledge about important events such as physical activities and medical complications. The inference is typically based on data collected with wearable sensors or those embedded in the environment. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of these systems is that the computational algorithms cannot be shared between users or reused in contexts different than the setting in which the training data are collected. For example, an activity recognition algorithm trained for a wrist-band sensor cannot be used on a smartphone worn on the waist. We propose an approach for automatic detection of physical sensor-contexts (e.g., on-body sensor location) without need for collecting new labeled training data. Our techniques enable system designers and end-users to share and reuse computational algorithms that are trained under different contexts and data collection settings. We develop a framework to autonomously identify sensor-context. We propose a gating function to automatically activate the most accurate computational algorithm among a set of shared expert models. Our analysis based on real data collected with human subjects while performing 12 physical activities demonstrate that the accuracy of our multi-view learning is only 7.9% less than the experimental upper bound for activity recognition using a dynamic sensor constantly migrating from one on-body location to another. We also compare our approach with several mixture-of-experts models and transfer learning techniques and demonstrate that our approach outperforms algorithms in both categories.},

volume={},

pages={1-8},
abstract={Fault tolerance (FT) is essential in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, in particular in the domains such as medical devices and automotive systems where a single fault in the system can lead to serious consequences. Non-volatile memory (NVM), on the other hand, is commonly used to improve system reliability due to its unique properties to retain data even if the power supply is lost. However, one of the most important drawbacks of NVM is that it imposes significant overhead regarding timing and energy. In this paper, we have proposed a unique technique with the use of NVM to create FT application specific architecture with almost no timing overhead and low energy overhead. We address the implementation of applications that are specified using synchronous data flow model of computation. We combine the use of NVM and classical CMOS transistors so that NVM judiciously stores selected complete states of the pertinent program. It allows the program to resume from the saved state in NVM when faults occur. The frequency of the state selection can be flexibly adjusted for an arbitrarily specified FT timing/energy overhead. Moreover, to find an optimal state selection (with low overhead), we have applied an improved min-cut max-flow algorithm. On a variety of typical benchmarks, the simulation results indicate that our approach incurs only a small overhead over lower bounds. It is also generic in a sense that it can be applied to a wide spectrum of underlying IoT architectures and computational models.},

abstract={Browser based simulators for wireless networks remain an unheard concept. Although wireless networks are utilized in various applications and are providing the backbone for the Internet of Things (IoT), it remains fairly difficult to quickly prototype a visualization. The need for an easily accessible simulator is a necessity, sparked by the alarming growth of sensor networks and the IoT. The development of a reliable and robust large-scale wireless system requires that design concepts are visualized in some digital form, before implementation. Simulations provide a cost effective and feasible method of examining the correctness and scalability of the system before deployment. This work presents a lightweight and interactive topology generator as part of a novel web based network simulator. The simulation framework, to the best of our knowledge, is unlike any other, as it renders and generates graphs in the browser. A simple GUI allows the user to generate isotropic and anisotropic topologies of different shapes, and provides tools that help manipulate complex graphs on client browsers and mobile devices. This tool has its application in several domains including computer network configuration and management, sensor and ad-hoc networks, medical infrastructure, biological and social media visualizations. This application can also facilitate research and education in the related areas.},

Maternal and child mortality remains a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, with one of its leading cause being inadequate provision of nutrients (or under-nutrition). This paper presents an indigenous mobile health (or mHealth) solution, named GRAVID, to address the gap of unavailability of context-based information on nutrition, medical, drug and substance use appropriate to meet identified needs of gravid women and subsequently their babies (for 5 years); within the African context. GRAVID also provides a monitoring tool for healthcare givers to track the progress of the gravid woman they oversee. The project was implemented with Android software development kit (SDK) for cost-effective development and widespread community coverage.

While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications. In this work, we present dynamic Fog, a high level programming model for time-sensitive applications that are geospatially distributed, large-scale, and latency-sensitive. We also analyze our fog model with healthcare data, more specifically with Heartrate data that is one of the most time-sensitive medical data which deals with life and death situations.

Advanced medical diagnostics will utilize biosensors for biological data acquisition. This paper introduces the forecasting of biosensors that have the potential to be used in POC and IoT applications. For this research three types of biosensors were selected. These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively. Bibliometrics with annual publication count did not appear to provide much value in forecasting the maturity growth of the three biosensors.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks are becoming even more a key element in networking and telecommunications especially with the advent of the Internet of Things paradigm, where each single device obtains a unique IPv6 address and is potentially reachable from everywhere through the Internet. Such technologies can be applied in many application fields with great success in terms of optimization of costs and resources, variety of implemented features, level of customization and expandability of each solution. Ambient Assisted Living is definitely one of the most interesting area for WSN and IoT application. In this scenery we propose an applicative example of the use of a IPv6 self configuring WSN with mesh topology. The network is formed by low cost and low power sensor nodes that integrate sub-GHz radio connectivity, belonging to the so-called LLN (Low Power and Lossy Network) scenery. The network stack is fully compatible with the major RFCs about Internet and wireless communications (CSMA, 6LowPAN, uIP, UDP, CoAP, etc.). The case study is a localization system using RSSI feature and does not need additional expensive hardware to be integrated into the nodes. The system proves to be fundamental in indoor environments (houses, clinics, nursing homes) for AAL systems that require localization or tracking of patients and medical equipments. Our tests are performed in extremely complex environment and shown good results localizing targets with an average error of about 2 meters that allows to properly detect the room where targets are located.},

abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming a reality, power-efficient techniques are crucial to achieve sufficient battery lifetimes. Whereas current medical IoT devices typically acquire data with a constant quality, we propose an architecture that dynamically adjusts the data quality adaptively based on the current medical condition of the subject being monitored. Since transmission and processing make up a large fraction of the energy consumption, the reduction of the link traffic and processing effort caused by such an adjustment results in a decreased energy consumption of the devices. For example, if anomalies in the monitored data are detected, the monitoring is performed with an increased granularity and more exhaustive processing. Further, not all data generated by the medical sensors needs to be transmitted during all times. Only if certain events are detected, the transmission of the complete data needs to be activated. In this paper, we present a novel approach for body-worn medical IoT devices. In particular, a generic, distributed architecture for the power-management of the whole system, which is based on dynamically switching services, is presented. We show that such an architecture can reduce the energy-consumption of medical sensors by up to 80 % in real-world measurements.},

abstract={Molecular programming of DNA makes use of computer-aided design, a programming language to encode the design, and a a compiler that compiles the code into a list of corresponding DNA strands. To implement the code, the developer orders the DNA from a supplier and then runs the molecular program in the laboratory. Instruments such as spectrofluorometers and atomic force microscopes help verify that the molecular program ran correctly, self-assembling to achieve the intended structure and behavior. Applications of molecular programming that are on the horizon for commercial production include targeted and personalized medical applications, biosensors for air and water, molecular robots that can navigate in cells, and biocompatible computational devices. In this talk I describe the experiences and results of our interdisciplinary team in applying goal-oriented requirements techniques, reaction network modeling, and probabilistic model checking to molecular programmed nanosystems. Requirements challenges include handling scalability to very large numbers of devices or services (roughly similar to the internet of things), dealing with probabilistic behavior, and understanding the limits of safe operation in changing (literally fluid) environments. I discuss how computational tools and thinking assist the development efforts and what limitations currently hamper our requirements analysis in practice. More broadly, I suggest that the approaches useful for molecular programming may help with understanding the requirements for other large, distributed, autonomous systems.},

While using the computer for long hours, little is cared about posture, resulting in body ache and some harmful everlasting effects on the body. Computer users can protect themselves from those health risks by implementing proper workplace design and good posture. Ergonomics is the science of designing the workplace, with respect to the capabilities and limitations of the worker. Computer vision syndrome is a term used specifically to describe vision related problems and the other symptoms caused by continuous computer use. Work stress also results in an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Remotely monitoring a patient's health condition is now easily possible with the use of sensors, actuators and mobile communication devices, combined together called as Internet of Things for Medical Devices. The Arduino Yun is a Microcontroller board having built-in Ethernet and Wi-Fi support and can be connected to a vast array of web-based Resource and services with the use of Temboo, a cloud-based platform with processes for APIs, databases, and more. The parameters considered under Ergonomic workspace like distance between user and computer, angle with which the computer screen should be positioned can be analysed using Ultrasonic and Accelerometer sensors; while pulse sensor to analyse heart rate under work pressure.

abstract={Internet of Things is a new generation of network service platform that allows everyday objects including small devices in sensor networks to be capable of connecting to the internet. Such an innovative technology can lead to positive changes in human life. An e-health service based on the Internet of Things has great potential. The popularity of intelligent mobile medical devices, wearable bio-medical sensor devices, cloud computing, and big data analysis have dramatically changed the usage pattern and business rule of e-health services based on the Internet of Things. The rapid development of e-health services based on the Internet of Things poses risks in security and privacy. In this study, we propose a new security scheme for an e-health service. This scheme allows both the local base station and hospital cloud server to authenticate each other, to secure the collection of health data. Our scheme uses the crypto hash function to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides mutual authentication with anonymity and terminates with a session key agreement between each local base station and the hospital cloud server. To assess our scheme, we conduct performance and security analysis. Results show that our scheme is secure, lightweight, and resistant to different types of attacks.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) system application for remote medical monitoring. The body pressure distribution is acquired through a pressure sensing mattress under the person's body, data is sent to a computer workstation for processing, and results are communicated for monitoring and diagnosis. The area of application of such system is large in the medical domain making the system convenient for clinical use such as in sleep studies, non or partial anesthetic surgical procedures, medical-imaging techniques, and other areas involving the determination of the body-posture on a mattress. In this vein, a novel method for human body posture recognition that consists in providing an optimal combination of signal acquisition, processing, and data storage to perform the recognition task in a quasi-real-time basis. A supervised learning approach was used to build a model using a robust synthetic data. The data has been generated beforehand, in a way to enhance and generalize the recognition capability while maintaining both geometrical and spatial performance. Low-cost and fast computation per sample processing along with autonomy, make the system suitable for long-term operation and IoT applications. The recognition results with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient κ = 0.866 was satisfactorily encouraging for further investigation in this field.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT), our surrounding will include a large variety of devices from different manufacturers. One of its promising branches, the medical IoT, will also be accompanied by heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures. However, the efficacy of a medical IoT application will depend on how well the surrounding smart devices collaborate with it to serve the individual needs of the users. Pre-programmed solutions lack flexibility to adapt to each need and environment, and fail to make full use of the capabilities of a set of smart devices. In this paper, we propose a concept based on the flexible and user-friendly synthesis and switching of services for medical IoT applications. The crux of the concept is to provide a methodology in which non-experts can dynamically define services based on their needs. We describe a potential scenario, discuss the associated challenges, and present preliminary results on the feasibility of this approach. Particularly, we focus on design aspects for realizing the concept and propose the use of interpreters on the smart devices as alternative solution. We show that such an approach is feasible in terms of implementation and energy consumption while still maintaining the full flexibility of the service synthesis.},

abstract={Modern smart phones are becoming helpful in the areas of Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and ambient health intelligence. By learning data from several mobile sensors, we detect nearness of the human body to a mobile device in a three-dimensional space with no physical contact with the device for non-invasive health diagnostics. We show that the human body generates wave patterns that interact with other naturally occurring ambient signals that could be measured by mobile sensors, such as, temperature, humidity, magnetic field, acceleration, gravity, and light. This interaction consequentially alters the patterns of the naturally occurring signals, and thus, exhibits characteristics that could be learned to predict the nearness of the human body to a mobile device, hence provide diagnostic information for medical practitioners. Our prediction technique achieved 88.75% accuracy and 88.3% specificity.},

abstract={Secrecy and integrity of communication, as well as the authenticity of messages must be ensured by the security primitives and is critical element in Internet of Things (IoT). Devices in IoT applications such as smart healthcare applications deal with sensitive data of our health and daily lives and thus can execute malicious actuating commands with serious safety consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure secure communication channel establishment among the medical sensors or devices and the remote servers. In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is energy efficient.},

abstract={Connected data has always been considered as a primary source to knowledge. Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly.

abstract={The past few decades have witnessed incredible advances in human health care, owing to the invention of devices such as MRI scanners, which allow physicians to monitor personal health in more detail than was ever previously possible. Such advances have drastically improved diagnostic quality and patient health care. Central to this incredible progress was the uncanny ability of technologists and academics to invent ever more useful tools to help physicians, be it the X-ray machine, CT, or MRI scanner. Whereas the aforementioned past-decades' tools aimed at acquiring personal data, the advent of the Internet-of-Things, vast computational power available in the cloud, and new data analytics algorithms will completely change the way we acquire and process medical data to improve health care going forward. In this paper, we conduct a quantitative feasibility study of a Digital Health (D-Health) system that is aimed at acquiring and processing health data using the emerging Internet-of-Everything paradigm. We specifically investigate the technological feasibility of communication, software, and data privacy aspects.},

abstract={Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internet-of-Things applications. Wearables leverage computational and machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from scratch upon any changes in the configuration of the network. Retraining of these algorithms requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and infeasible. We propose an approach for automatic retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our real-time multi-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an accuracy of 80.66% in activity recognition, which is an improvement of 15.96% in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node. This performance is only 7.96% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.},

abstract={In the teletransmission of images or medical imaging, image reconstruction or enhancement (denoising) is a significant topic. We can consider it as a typical issue of the Blind Source Separation (BSS) which interfere with transmission and cause blurs in images. Denoising and reconstruction refer to the removal of the unknown signals which lead to interference from the signals we intend to receive. Independent component analysis (ICA) has prominent performance in this field. This paper proposed to apply particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to conduct accelerated computing of the rate of convergence of demixing matrix in ICA. Besides, it used Borel Regular Measure (BRM) based on Infomax to put forward a simple algorithm which was potential to be realized on a circuit chip. Our results of experiment have proved that after the separation of noises, the PSNR of the images has an apparent good effect. In addition, in the era of the Internet of Things, image and video perceptive products are facing the noises generated in transmission or by hardware interference. This paper will serve as an effective solution.},

abstract={Summary form only given. As people get excited about the latest idea for "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things", computer people often shake our heads and say "It won't scale." Pessimism isn't always justified: we have been able to scale up quite a number of tasks, from connectivity through search to social media. But other applications are recalcitrant, from energy management to medical records. The conventional computer-science view is that scaling systems is about computational complexity; about whether the storage or communications required for a task grows more than linearly in the number of users. Over the past thirty years we've developed a pretty good theory of that, but we're learning that it's nowhere near enough. In this talk I present a complementary view, based on over thirty years' experience of security engineering, that the real limits to scale are usually elsewhere. Even where the data are manageable and the algorithms straightforward, things can fail because of the scaling properties of the social context, the economic model or the regulatory environment. This makes some automation projects much harder than they seem. When it comes to safety and privacy many of the attacks that are easy to do in the lab are rare in the wild, as they don't scale either. But others surprise us; no-one in the intelligence community anticipated a leak on the Snowden scale. In short, scaling is now a problem not of computer science but of systems engineering, economics, governance and much else. Conceiving problems too narrowly makes failure likely, while good engineering will require ever more awareness of context. The implications for research, education and policy bear some thought.},

abstract={Internet of Things based health care systems promise a significant contribution towards improvement of medical information systems through automation of routine monitoring of patients and real-time transmission of medical records. However, digitisation of identification, tracking and monitoring of patients remains a challenge in rural areas of Africa, not to mention of associated power and internet connectivity constraints. This paper proposes a general architecture for monitoring of growth and vital parameters of under-five children. The system alerts medical personnel in real time about under-weight cases or abnormal readings of vital parameters in order to take further medical diagnosis. Furthermore, the system saves the child's personalised measurements to a cloud-based data store in real time. Preliminary tests of network performance of the IoT application design resulted in an average latency of 1.7s and system availability of 99.96%, thus validating its usability.},

abstract={Modern day computing paradigms foster for a huge community of involved participants from almost the entire spectrum of human endeavour. For computing and data processing there are individual Computers, their Clusters, Grids, and, finally, the Clouds. For pure data communication there is the Internet, and for the Human-understandable Information Communication for example the World Wide Web. The rapid development of hand-held mobile devices with high computational capabilities and Internet connectivity enabled certain parts of Clouds to be “lowered” into the so called “thin clients”. This led to development of the Fog-Computing Paradigm as well as development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) concepts. However, the most significant amount of information processing all around us is done on the lowest possible computing level, outright connected to the physical environment and mostly directly controlling our human immediate surroundings. These “invisible” information processing devices we find in our car's motor, in the refrigerator, the gas boiler, air-conditioners, wending machines, musical instruments, radio-receivers, home entertainment systems, traffic-controls, theatres, lights, wood-burning stoves, and ubiquitously all over the industry and in industrial products. These devices, which are neither at the cloud/fog edge, nor even at the mobile edge, but rather at the physical edge of computing are the basis of the Dew Computing Paradigm. The merits of seamlessly integrating those “dew” devices into the Cloud - Fog - Dew Computing hierarchy are enormous, for individuals, the public and industrial sectors, the scientific community and the commercial sector, by bettering the physical and communicational, as well as the intellectual, immediate human environment. In the possibility of dev- loping integrated home management/entertainment/maintenance systems, self-organising traffic-control systems, intelligent driver suggestion systems, coordinated building/car/traffic pollution control systems, real-time hospital systems with all patient and equipment status and control collaborating with the medical staff, fully consistent synaesthetic artistic performances including artists and independent individuals (“active public”) from wide apart, power distribution peek filtering, self-reorganisation and mutual cooperation systems based on informed behaviour of individual power consumption elements, emergency systems which cooperate with the town traffic, etc., etc., the Dew-Computing paradigm shows the way towards the Distributed Information Services Environment (DISE), and finally towards the present civilisation's aim of establishment of a Global Information Processing Environment (GIPE). It is therefore essential, through Research, Innovation and Development, to explore the realm of possibilities of Dew Computing, solve the basic problems of integration of the “dew” level with the higher level Dew-Fog-Cloud hierarchy, with special attention to the necessity of information (not only data) processing and communication, and demonstrate the viability and high effectiveness of the developed architecture in several areas of human endeavour through real life implementations. The present scientific and technological main objective is to provide the concepts, methods and proof-of-concept implementations that are moving Dew Computing from a theoretical/experimental concept to a validated technology. Finally, it will be necessary to define and standardise the basics of the Dew Computing Architecture, Language and Ontology, which is a necessity for the seamless integration of the emerging new Global Information Processing Architecture into the Fog and Cloud Paradigms, as a way towards the ab},

abstract={One of the challenges faced by today's Internet of Things (IoT) is to efficiently support machine-to-machine communication, given that the remote sensors and the gateway devices are connected through low bandwidth, unreliable, or intermittent wireless communication links. In this paper, we quantitatively compare the performance of IoT protocols, namely MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), DDS (Data Distribution Service) and a custom UDP-based protocol in a medical setting. The performance of the protocols was evaluated using a network emulator, allowing us to emulate a low bandwidth, high system latency, and high packet loss wireless access network. This paper reports the observed performance of the protocols and arrives at the conclusion that although DDS results in higher bandwidth usage than MQTT, its superior performance with regard to data latency and reliability makes it an attractive choice for medical IoT applications and beyond.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a computing process, where each physical object is equipped with sensors, microcontrollers and transceivers for empowering communication and is built with suitable protocol stacks which help them interacting with each other and communicating with the users. In IoT based healthcare, diverse distributed devices aggregate, analyse and communicate real time medical information to the cloud, thus making it possible to collect, store and analyse the large amount of data in several new forms and activate context based alarms. This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system.

abstract={Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN's) are becoming more and more promising and applicable to a variety of fields: military, environmental, medical, wild life habitat, and transportation as well wearable devices, target-tracking. WSN are expected to be a main player in the Internet of Things technology. Power management is very important factor in considering WSN's and it has been demonstrated that communication cost is higher than the computational as nodes consume most of the energy in communication. Added to the fact that sensors could be closely deployed and report the same reading, the data aggregation concept was introduced to resolve those issues and for the sake of better performance at a reduced cost. Nonetheless, sensing devices are prone to failure due to several aspects such as node failure or low batteries as well as being compromised. In this paper, we are introducing a novel method Secure Data Aggregation Model (SDAM) aiming at assuring a secure aggregate communication at a low cost (in terms of resources). Our simulation results showed that implementing SDAM resulted into an increase in the energy efficiency as well as a considerable reduction in cross-layering overhead.},

abstract={Nowadays, ageing related diseases represent one of the most relevant challenges for developed countries. The use of healthcare remote technology may allow reducing most of the management of the chronic diseases meanwhile it may also contribute to the improvement of elderly people's quality of life. Unfortunately, despite the advent of Internet of things and the even decreasing price of sensors, current proposals are not extensible during runtime meaning that they need to be maintained offline by engineers. Therefore, in this paper we discuss how to build an ad-hoc extensible (during runtime) healthcare monitoring system by using low cost wireless sensors and already existent Internet of things technology as communication platform. Moreover, we present a prototype of a basic healthcare remote monitoring system, which alerts, in real time, patients' relatives or medical doctors that an elderly people is experienced a problem that could need medical attention or hospitalization.},

Flexible electronics is enabling a technology base that has the opportunity for the next high-tech manufacturing job creation. Early silicon CMOS manufacturing created high paying manufacturing jobs in US fabrication lines. Today, many of these jobs are moving to foreign Countries. Flexible electronics manufacturing approaches open the opportunity for innovative, low-cost fabrication techniques combining traditional US-strengths in plate-to-plate semiconductor manufacturing with roll-to-roll printing. Such approaches will enable mid-size companies to enter into manufacturing thereby broadening the job creation within the US. These innovative approaches to achieve the low-cost and high volume products will enable a US manufacturing dominance in an emerging Global industry.

abstract={Advances in information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). In the modern health care environment, the usage of IoT technologies brings convenience of physicians and patients, since they are applied to various medical areas (such as real-time monitoring, patient information management, and healthcare management). The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT developments in healthcare system, where a patient can be monitored using a collection of tiny-powered and lightweight wireless sensor nodes. However, the development of this new technology in healthcare applications without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. In this paper, at first, we highlight the major security requirements in BSN-based modern healthcare system. Subsequently, we propose a secure IoT-based healthcare system using BSN, called BSN-Care, which can efficiently accomplish those requirements.},

abstract={Cloud computing paradigm is becoming very popular these days. However, it does not include wireless sensors and mobile phones which are needed to enable new emerging applications such as remote home medical monitoring. Therefore, a combined Cloud-Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provides scalable on-demand data storage and resilient computation power at the cloud side as well as anytime, anywhere health data monitoring at the IoT side. As both the privacy of personal medical data and flexible data access should be provided, the data in the Cloud are always encrypted and access control must be operated upon encrypted data together with being fine-grained to support diverse accessibility. Since a plain combination of encryption before access control is not robust and flexible, we propose a scheme with tailored design. The scheme makes use of cipher-policy attributes based encryption to empower robustness and flexibility. The scheme describes a general framework to solve the secure requirements, and leaves the flexibility of concrete constructions intentionally.},

This paper attempts to classify smart appliances such as micro oven as health devices and explains the importance of data from this set of devices for monitoring user health goals. Fully distributed health systems operate in a peer-to-peer manner, where they both store and manage health information locally on each device.

abstract={In the upcoming Internet of Things era there is a strong demand for smart miniaturized sensors, which can be integrated in all kinds of environments, from industry to medical. Microcameras with real time image processing can serve a wide range of applications like face or gesture recognition as well as traffic sign detection or lane departure warning. Today's microcameras consist of an optics module with lenses and image sensor, which is attached by a flex cable or connector to one or more PCB's with image processor and other required components. Drawback of this construction is limited reliability, relatively large size and high cost. This paper describes the development and realization of an extremely compact microcamera module using a highly efficient Panel Level Packaging (PLP) technology. Most components are embedded into a PCB of 16×16 mm2 size and 3.6 mm thickness with a weight of only 2 g. On top of the PCB a 3 MPixel image sensor is soldered. The basis of the module is a Cognivue image processor. Additionally the module contains 256 Mbit Flash Memory, 5 DC/DC converters, an oscillator and several passives. In total 74 components are embedded into the PCB. The module was completely realized on PCB format with in total 77 modules per 12"x9" panel. All process steps, from component assembly to final test, were performed on panel level. The system design and PLP manufacturing process will be described in detail.},

Unquestionably, emergence of IoT (Internet of things) technology contributes to the development of medical healthcare informatization.

Consequently, how to protect the privacy of users' information in a smart healthcare system remains a pending problem. Under this background, this paper analyses the main problems in current smart healthcare system. Furthermore, a lightweight private homomorphism algorithm and an encryption algorithm improved from DES are designed when considering the characteristic of IoT and privacy protection.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technologies interconnect broad ranges of network devices irrespective of their resource capabilities and local networks. In order to upgrade the standard of life of elderly people, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems are also widely deployed in the context of IoT applications. To preserve user security and privacy in AAL systems, it is significant to ensure secure communication link establishment among the medical devices and the remote hosts or servers that are interested in accessing the critical health data. However, due to the limited resources available in such constrained devices, it is challenging to exploit expensive cryptographic operations in the conventional security protocols. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel proxy-based authentication and key establishment protocol, which is lightweight and suitable to safeguard sensitive data generated by resource-constrained devices in IoT-enabled AAL systems.},

year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={581-588},
abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},

On the other hand, construction and delivery of a smart service benefit from additional intelligence attributes, beyond a fixed set of healthcare services of a given medical information system. For this promising class of m-Health services, we introduce reference scenarios of personalized assistance for a mobile patient with focus on emergency cases.

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a research field whose main objective is to develop health monitoring systems for elderly patients at home, increasing the degree of patient independence during chronic diseases treatment. AAL systems are composed by several technologies: medical sensors and actuators, computer and mobile devices, Wireress Sensors Networks (WSN), computer networks, software infrastructure and applications. A comprehensive software infrastructure for AAL systems should use these technologies in an integrated manner and be able to cover scenarios involving several patient mobility level, patient locations, and levels of physical and cognitive abilities. The integration of AAL with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies expands the scope of these systems with the ability to connect various sensors and actuators, integrating them into a single network that serves the purpose of patient health monitoring. In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive Cloud based IoT softwre infrastructure for Ambient Assisted Living. The main components of this software infrastructure are the M-Hub and the SDDL middleware. Preliminary results show that the proposed infrastructure has the potential to be applied in a wide range of health monitoring scenarios.},

Our system is made up of distributed software agents (within incubator's data hubs, medical servers and mobile terminals of medical staff and parents) based on Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP). The use of CoAP based agents, as well as URIs for data IDs, enables the integration of our proposed NIMS system and its collected data into an Internet of Things (IoT) wide scenario.

abstract={Body Area Networks (BANs) are considered as the key building blocks for the emerging application of upcoming generation of networks that would be extended towards the wearable technology as well as the Internet of Things. Starting from the traditional network scenarios to today's advanced network infrastructure, BANs have played a very significant role in developing the computer network industry and specifically the medical sector as well. This paper/ article describe several composite research-based approaches for Topology Control (TC) for BANs while considering the network performance. TC considered being major network parameters that profoundly influence different network metrics including the network traffic. Also we discuss on different BAN topologies that should be selected according to the foreseen medical application and the deployment environment. TC techniques have been widely used in Wireless Sensor Network (BANs are one kind of sensor network) so as to reduce the energy consumption, to extend the network operational time, to reduce radio interference and to prove a positive effect on the network traffic carrying capacity etc. In this paper, we also state several problems that are related to the topology control particularly in BANs environment and outline how TC largely influences several parameters on network performances. Our survey also explains about how TC techniques can be intelligently used to enhance and increase the network performance in BANs according to relevant medical application.},

abstract={The current trend of population growth demands a more flexible and readily available healthcare services compared to traditional centralized approach. Mobile and wearable devices that have sensing and Internet access capabilities offer the opportunity of changing how medical services are delivered to the patients. The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology. The protocol stacks of the edge router and router are validated through successful connectivity tests and packet drop tests. The single-hop communication latency is also measured to give an indication of the overheads introduced by the stack.},

abstract={With the increasing availability of medical sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for personal use, it becomes feasible to maintain a repository of measurements for personal health conditions. Consequently, it is tempting to analyze in-progress diseases and to identify the development of potential diseases with the measurement repository. However, there are a number of technical challenges in developing such applications, modeling the relationships between diseases and acquired measurements, representing medical expertise in machine-readable forms, and high complexity in diagnosing disease methods. We adopt a semantic-based approach to resolve the first two challenges, and utilize the concept of cloud computing to tackle with the last challenge. In this paper, we present a cloud platform which provides a core set of functionality needed to enable personal medical diagnosis over the network. We believe that the presented platform provides a comprehensive core functionality needed for various types of personal healthcare IoT applications.},

Even though there is a vast development of traffic management system and automotive technologies, the number of accidents increases day to day. In most of the cases of accidents, lack of providing quick first aid and timely medical service is the cause for loss of life. Hence it is necessary to develop a common framework for accident detection, avoiding secondary accidents, timely alert of first responder and optimizing the traffic for the first responder (ambulance). In our approach we combine emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and VANET to propose a framework for accident alerting and traffic optimization for ambulances Our approach provides reliable, autonomous framework which allows vehicles, ambulances, and hospitals to establish and maintain their network themselves. Our approach reduces the amount of time lacks in alerting ambulance and due to traffic congestion and increases the chance of saving the lives of the accident victims.},

abstract={The eHealth trend has spread globally. Internet of Things(IoT) devices for medical service and pervasive Personal Health Information (PHI) systems play important roles in the eHealth environment. A cloud-based PHIsystem appears promising but raises privacy and information security concerns. We propose a cloud-based fine-grained health information access control framework for lightweight IoT devices with data dynamics auditing and attribute revocation functions. Only symmetric cryptographyis required for IoT devices, such as wireless body sensors. A variant of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, dual encryption, and Merkle hash trees are used to support fine-grained access control, efficient dynamic data auditing, batch auditing, and attribute revocation. Moreover, the proposed scheme also defines and handles the cloud reciprocity problem wherein cloud service providers can help each other avoid fines resulting from data loss. Security analysis and performance comparisons show that the proposed scheme is an excellent candidate for a cloud-based PHI system.},

Traditional sectors such as transportation, medical and avionics, are witnessing fundamental changes in the supply chain and in the content where the interactions between the physical world and the computing world are becoming increasingly tight. Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS. Indeed, low power consumption is an essential requirement for the swarm of devices especially in the domain of wearable devices for healthcare. Coupled with low cost and reliability, power consumption has to be taken into consideration for any CPS deployment.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) describes an ICT based environment that exposes personalized and context-aware intelligent services, thus creating an appropriate experience to the end user to support independent living and improvement of the everyday quality of life of both healthy elderly and disabled people. The social and economic impact of AAL systems have boosted the research activities that combined with the advantages of enabling technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve the performance and the efficiency of such systems. Sensors and actuators inside buildings can create an intelligent sensing environments that help gather realtime data for the patients, monitor their vital signs and identify abnormal situations that need medical attention. AAL applications might be life critical and therefore have very strict requirements for their performance with respect to the reliability of the devices, the ability of the system to gather data from heterogeneous devices, the timeliness of the data transfer and their trustworthiness. This work presents the functional architecture of SOrBet (Marie Curie IAPP project) that provides a framework for interconnecting efficiently smart devices, equipping them with intelligence that helps automating many of the everyday activities of the inhabitants. SOrBet is a paradigm shift of traditional AAL systems based on a hybrid architecture, including both distributed and centralized functionalities, extensible, self-organising, robust and secure, built on the concept of “reliability by design”, thus being capable of meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of demanding applications such as AAL.},

abstract={Demand for medical services is increasing rapidly because of worldwide aging and increase in population. Most countries are trying to introduce and disseminate telemedicine service (TMS) to decrease the necessary budget for health services. However, many doctors are concerned about the security of telemedicine services. Security of medical information should be reinforced for widespread use of telemedicine. This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats. This paper considers the security aspects of telemedicine and the Internet of things (IoT) together, because, after all, healthcare-devices perform a function of telecommunication. This paper reviews the necessity and strategy for enhancing security of medical information systems. The risk of data leak in medical information systems is analyzed quantitatively and is used to support the need for reinforcement of security.},

abstract={Wearables are the next big development in the mobile internet of things. Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide hap tic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.},

abstract={As the Internet of Things becomes a reality, proliferation of wireless devices such as ZigBee nodes has accelerated. Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.1},

abstract={Smart mobile people have a great potential to extend the existing Internet of Things infrastructures by implementing genuine ubiquitous healthcare (U-health) applications, ensuring anywhere and anytime patients connectivity. Through the forwarding of sensing data from person to person until reaching a connected medical server, concrete U-health becomes true with the emerging of future Body-to-Body Networks. Indeed, the coexistence of multiple WBANs (Wireless Body Area Networks), the communication and interactions between them extend the classical concept of WBAN and present the new paradigm referred to as Body-to-Body Network (BBN). This paradigm supports a number of innovative applications such as U-health, entertainment, interactive gaming and military, to cite a few. In this paper, we present a survey of BBNs focusing on three principal axes: energy efficiency, mobility prediction, and quality of service (QoS). Then, we present and discuss different candidate protocols that can be used in BBNs, while illustrating main BBN design challenges and several open issues.},

abstract={Health is the fundamental capability humans require to perceive, feel, and act effectively, and as such, it represents a primary element in the development of the individual, but also of the environment humans belongs to. That is why it is necessary to provide adequate ways and means to ensure the appropriate healthcare delivery based on parameters monitoring and direct providing of the medical assistance. The new technologies development and implementation, especially the Internet and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), enable global approach to the health care system infrastructure development. This leads to e-health system that, in real time manner, supplies a valuable set of information relevant to all of the stakeholders (patients, medical and paramedical stuff, and health insurance) regardless their current location. Commercial systems in this area usually do not meet the general patient needs, and those that do are usually economically unacceptable due to the high operational and development costs. In this paper, based on well-known low-cost technologies, there is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solution for a sustainable and adaptable patient oriented infrastructure development, presented.},

abstract={The connecting of physical units, such as thermostats, medical devices and self-driving vehicles, to the Internet is happening very quickly and will most likely continue to increase exponentially for some time to come. Valid concerns about security, safety and privacy do not appear to be hampering this rapid growth of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). There have been many popular and technical publications by those in software engineering, cyber security and systems safety describing issues and proposing various “fixes.” In simple terms, they address the “why” and the “what” of IoT security, safety and privacy, but not the “how.” There are many cultural and economic reasons why security and privacy concerns are relegated to lower priorities. Also, when many systems are interconnected, the overall security, safety and privacy of the resulting systems of systems generally have not been fully considered and addressed. In order to arrive at an effective enforcement regime, we will examine the costs of implementing suitable security, safety and privacy and the economic consequences of failing to do so. We evaluated current business, professional and government structures and practices for achieving better IoT security, safety and privacy, and found them lacking. Consequently, we proposed a structure for ensuring that appropriate security, safety and privacy are built into systems from the outset. Within such a structure, enforcement can be achieved by incentives on one hand and penalties on the other. Determining the structures and rules necessary to optimize the mix of penalties and incentives is a major goal of this paper.},

The wireless system is constructed on top of 6LoWPAN energy efficient communication infrastructure to maximize the operation time.

The presented fault tolerance approach covers many fault situations such as malfunction of sink node hardware and traffic bottleneck at a node due to a high receiving data rate. A method for extending the number of medical sensing nodes at a single gateway is presented.

abstract={Energy constrained devices, operating on short-range wireless networking standards such as IEEE802.15.4 and IEEE802.11x, are expected to be deployed for the IoT (Internet of Things) applications. However, co-located deployment of such devices based on different standards using the same 2.4 GHz license free Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) spectrum, introduces coexistence issues, specifically intra-and inter cluster interference. The latter would create a much more adverse impact on these devices than the former, resulting in significant performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel area packet scheduler that allows co-located 802.15.4 and 802.11 devices to share the transmission channel and coexist with minimal inter-cluster interference any inter cluster interference. A new OPNET simulation model was developed to evaluate the performance of this scheduler. Simulation results show that the packet scheduler can mitigate the coexistence problem while maintaining high throughput and low end-to-end delay, thereby increasing the overall network QoS.},

abstract={Machine to machine (M2M) communications are expected to form one of the fundamental building blocks of the future Internet of Things (IoT). In view of the scarcity of spectrum and the service requirements of traditional users, providing network access to the extremely large number of devices in IoT and M2M scenarios is one of the fundamental problems for network designers and operators. As a possible solution to this issue, this paper explores the possibility of using the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band for supporting M2M communications while co-existing with traditional users of this band. Since IEEE 802.11 or WiFi based networks are the most common networking technology in the ISM band, this paper presents an evaluation of “white spaces” in WiFi networks (i.e. periods where the WiFi network is not using the channel) that may be used opportunistically for M2M communications. Using a MMPP/G/1/K queue to model the operation of a WiFi access point, we characterize the WiFi white spaces in terms of their frequency, duration, and their probability distribution. Our results show that WiFi white spaces provide considerable transmission opportunities that may be exploited for M2M communications.},

abstract={If truly thin embedded and human worn flexible electronics are to become a commercial reality for wearable electronics, medical devices, and internet of things tags, effective energy storage technologies that safely and robustly match the mechanical flexibility of the overall system form factor are required. At the same time, the energy and transient power needs of functions such as wireless connectivity, information display, and high sample rate sensing must be supported. These capabilities have time-dependent power and current requirements often not captured in simple energy and capacity metrics. In this paper, a progression of energy storage approaches, challenges and learning experiences will be presented from the perspective of an energy storage technology developer. The essential requirements for energy storage for feature-driven applications in flexible electronics are addressed with the goal of finding the most compelling fit between products needs, consumer safety and the technology capabilities of different energy storage approaches. Micropower modules from supercapacitors to microbatteries and their limitations for flexible electronics will be discussed in terms of capacity, power and charge retention as the starting point. Following this discussion, limitations of lithium technologies in this flexible and thin (<; 1 mm) application space are also outlined. This paper then presents a review of key requirements for energy storage for high functionality flexible electronics prototype systems and some approaches that have been explored to meet those needs. This leads to the conclusion that safe, low cost, flexible electronics energy storage requirements may be most appropriately met using intrinsically stable battery chemistry. Furthermore, such a materials approach allows for simpler lower cost processing and packaging, such as additive printing and roll to roll processing of thin and therefore more mechanically flexible cells. E- amples and performance data from such a zinc polymer battery technology are given and compared to other thin and flexible battery approaches.},

abstract={The attack of `Stuxnet' computer warm on the Iranian nuclear program highlighted the need of cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and embedded systems. The evolution of embedded systems to Internet-of-Things (IoT), where every device from a light-bulb to a medical implant device will be connected over internet. This connected world scenario requires secure communication channels to ensure information-security. OpenSSL is a defacto standard for secure communication over the internet. The memory bound check failure vulnerability CEV-2014-0160 was discovered in OpenSSL on 07th Feb 2014. The vulnerability is commonly known as Heartbleed bug that caused vulnerability in more than 16% of the total webservers. The Heartbleed bug can cause a leakage of 64K memory bytes of memory in plaintext that may contain security keys, X.509 certificates and user's private data. OpenSSL is also used to secure connected embedded devices. The Heartbleed vulnerability has greater impact on embedded systems/IoT because the few KBs or MBs memory of embedded device can be leaked in few seconds during a well-crafted Heartbleed attack. This research demonstrates a Heartbleed attack, and develops a patch for Heartbleed vulnerability. This research proposes an update to RFC-6520 that can be used as Heartbleed patch for embedded systems.

There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service.

year={2014},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is becoming a commonly used terminology due to the idea of Internet of Things (IoT). M2M communication has many areas of application, such as in; medical, transport, environmental monitoring, smart grids among others. As the field of its application expands, the number of M2M devices is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years. Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been identified as one of the suitable wireless communication technologies for M2M communication. Incorporating M2M communication on top of regular Human-to-Human (H2H) communication in LTE is a challenging task due to the expected increase in the number of M2M devices coupled with the unique characteristics of M2M traffic. Therefore, the current scheduling and resource allocation techniques among others being used in LTE need to be refined to efficiently accommodate M2M communication. A scheduling scheme called fixed Access Grant Time Interval (AGTI) time-controlled scheduling scheme was proposed for scheduling M2M traffic in LTE. Resource sharing and utilization under this scheme is inefficient due to fixed AGTI assignment which results into fixed nature of resource allocation. In this work, we propose a scheduling scheme called Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme in which the AGTI is dynamically assigned basing on M2M and H2H traffic intensities. We model the proposed scheme using M/G/m/m queuing technique focusing on resource utilization and Quality of Service (QoS) of both M2M and H2H traffic. The analytical results show that, the Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme achieves; better percentage resource utilization as compared to Fixed AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme while providing optimal blocking probability for both M2M and H2H traffic. However, the monitoring of resource usage and reassignments of AGTI in Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme increases scheduler complexity.},

To reduce these issues the platform integrates the fast, easy-to-use, safe and low-power Near Field Communication protocol for data transmission in proximity, addressing the Internet of Things paradigm. The platform uses the Arduino NANO board and the related open source software libraries, so it could be possible to add new functionalities in a fast way.

We have built an application called 'ECG Android App' which provides the end user with visualization of their Electro Cardiogram (ECG) waves and data logging functionality in the background. The logged data can be uploaded to the user's private centralized cloud or a specific medical cloud, which keeps a record of all the monitored data and can be retrieved for analysis by the medical personnel. Though the idea of building a medical application using IoT and cloud techniques is not totally new, there is a lack of empirical studies in building such a system. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of IoT. Further, the paper presents an infrastructure for the healthcare domain, which consists of various technologies: IOIO microcontroller, signal processing, communication protocols, secure and efficient mechanisms for large file transfer, data base management system, and the centralized cloud. The paper emphasizes on the system and software architecture and design which is essential to overall IoT and cloud based medical applications. The infrastructure presented in the paper can also be applied to other healthcare domains. It concludes with recommendations and extensibilities found for the solution in the healthcare domain.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that considers the pervasive presence of things or objects/equipment that communicate through wireless, cable connections and can interact with each other and can collaborate with other things or objects, to create new services and medical applications in order to achieve common objectives (diagnosis, treatment, patient rehabilitation). Considering that the Android operating system allows data storage, connectivity, Web browser, media support, development environment, we propose to develop an application that will come in support to any patient who is suffering from hypotension/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or other metabolic diseases associated, and even more for patients with vision impairments who are unable to be independent. With the help of such application the patients and physicians can monitor measured values of blood pressure, values of blood glucose, weight, body mass index, cholesterol, etc., having the possibility of creating a database and a medical history, in which the values specified by the medical devices are stored on the smartphone using Bluetooth™ technique. In this paper we developed an application on the Android platform which aims at recording data measured (SBP - Systolic Blood Pressure, DBP - Diastolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate) by the electronic sphygmomanometer which communicates using Bluetooth™ technique. The application offers the possibility of transmitting medical data via mobile Internet or wireless. Data will be compared with standard values and if these values are not in the normal range, the patient is alerted, including family doctor, or in the worst case the emergency service.},

abstract={The number of Non-communicable disease (NCD) patients in China is growing rapidly, which is far beyond the capacity of the national health and social security system. Community health stations do not have enough doctors to take care of their patients in traditional ways. In order to establish a bridge between doctors and patients, we propose eBPlatform, which is an information system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for homecare of the NCD patients. The eBox is a sensor which can be deployed in the patient's home for blood pressure measurement, blood sugar measurement and ECG signals collection. Some services are running on the remote server, which can receive the samples, filter and analyze the ECG signals. The uploaded data will be pushed to a web portal, with which doctors provide treatments online. The system requirements, design and implementation of hardware and software are discussed respectively. Finally, we investigate a case study with 50 NCD patients for half a year in Beijing. The results show that eBPlatform can increase the efficiency of the doctor and make a big progress to eliminate the numerical imbalance between community medical practitioners and NCD patients.},

Our approach facilitates the use of shared information in ways that were not envisioned by the original device manufacturer, thus enabling the continued independent improvement of patient safety and information integration throughout the life cycle of devices.

In this paper the benefits of combining data and power into a single cable that the Power over Ethernet standard provides have been leveraged by designing a Power over Ethernet enabled Internet of Things gateway which delivers both cloud connectivity and energy to medical sensors and smart hospital appliances. In addition, the gateway has been customized for processing and transmission of health related data in order to alleviate the processing overhead that wireless sensors have allowing them to extend the battery lifetime and overall system energy efficiency and performance.},

abstract={Recently it has been observed that internet of things (IoT) technology is being introduced in medical environment to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this global connectivity is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. IPv6, the new Internet Protocol has made every grain of sand on earth addressable and thus emergence of a new technology called IoT. IoT is simply a machine to machine M2M communication and Sensor nodes are proved to be best suited for this new technology. IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) has attracted lots of attention recently as it can be used for communication of IoT. This paper provides a framework for medical environment, for reducing handoff (HO) latency and signaling overhead while the patient is on the move inside the hospital premises and further it can be applied to other domains also where can be applicable. Sensor nodes can be used for collecting the particular parameters of human body which constitutes wireless body area network (WBAN). The proposed framework surely reduces the signaling overhead and thus the HO latency and hence there will be an improvement in QoS.},

abstract={Cloud computing and Internet of things (IOT) technologies can support a new generation of PHR systems which are provided as cloud services that contain patient data (health and social) from various sources, including automatically transmitted data from Internet connected devices of patient living space (e.g. medical devices connected to patients at home care). In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},

abstract={Nowadays ICT technology is infiltrated to all areas of human existence and the number of objects, animate or inanimate, actively acting within Internet services is rapidly growing. The reasons of object monitoring are permanently changing and evolving, following the development of public and non-public sectors. For example using of various tags, stuck on goods, are used for goods identification in stores and for security reasons for many years. Further, the assets identification using passive tags turns to active identification enabling automatic inventorying and permanent assets protection at the same time. Active identification provides also the remote monitoring of objects, moreover, when object's data are safely shared on Internet environment, a number of cloud services can be enabled to allow customers remote monitoring of objects. Based on such ICT environment, the architecture called Internet of Things is ready to come to daily life. The objects considered in such systems can be home appliances, medical devices, building assets, computers, mobile devices, cars, production components, manufacturing tools, building materials and, of course, people. Especially the bindings and relations among objects, for example an identified person having an expensive identified device and passing unauthorized zone is evaluated as a risk transaction resulting to a denied access. Beside the object identification the differentiation of static and moving objects brings a new important parameter to improve the IoT concept.},

As its typical case, IoT-based smart rehabilitation systems are becoming a better way to mitigate problems associated with aging populations and shortage of health professionals. Although it has come into reality, critical problems still exist in automating design and reconfiguration of such a system enabling it to respond to the patient's requirements rapidly. This paper presents an ontology-based automating design methodology (ADM) for smart rehabilitation systems in IoT. Ontology aids computers in further understanding the symptoms and medical resources, which helps to create a rehabilitation strategy and reconfigure medical resources according to patients' specific requirements quickly and automatically. Meanwhile, IoT provides an effective platform to interconnect all the resources and provides immediate information interaction. Preliminary experiments and clinical trials demonstrate valuable information on the feasibility, rapidity, and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

abstract={The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it possible for connecting various smart objects together through the Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely researched over the past decade. Recently, many research results of IoT related to emergency system, smart building and medical system, etc. The key for IoT applications are the ability to interact with physical world through computation, communication, and machine control. However, each sensor device in IoT cannot conveniently communicate with other terminal devices through internet protocol. So, it is necessary to establish protocol translation stack or equipment between two WSN groups. That is very inefficient and high overhead cost of network construction. The development of micro-IP (uIP) solves this problem. The uIP reduce cost of protocol translation and it also realizes the machine to machine (M2M) concept in wireless sensor network. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution for porting uIP library to the wireless sensor network devices and presents the integration of a speaker module and IPv6 ready sensor device. We also propose a safe building application based on the integrated system to help people escaping from disaster environment. In conclusion, our contributions are building an IPv6 ready wireless sensor network environment and develop a safe building system to make the concept of IoT in IPv6 network environment come true.},

abstract={We are witnessing increasing penetration of pervasive computing into business and personal environments. Its advances, among other things, enable new opportunities for better health services but, as a side effect, it introduces new threats to privacy. If anywhere, it is in the health care sector that privacy is of utmost importance. Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most "primitive" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning. This latter contribution also paves the way for further development and for applications of pervasive computing in general.},

abstract={Everyday around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created. There is also a growing trend toward integrating real world data into the Internet, which is provided by sensory devices, smart phones, GPS, and many other sources that capture and communicate real world data. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real world objects (i.e., Things). This paper focuses on how to optimize the data exchange between the sensory devices and applications in IoT and Cyber-Physical systems. In particular, a method to construct higher-level abstractions of data at local gateways is proposed. This will reduce the traffic load imposed on the communication networks that provide the real world data. The proposed method is based on an information processing algorithm where gateways analyze the data collected from the sensors and create higher level abstractions. We enhance the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) algorithm that is used as a building block of the abstraction creation framework, into an optimized version for sensor data, called sensor SAX. We extend the parsimonious covering theory that is usually used for medical purposes with a probabilistic parsimonious criterion in the temporal domain to infer abstractions based on time-dependent sensor data. The proposed method is analyzed and evaluated over a real world data set and the results are discussed in terms of the data size reduction, accuracy, and latency needed to create the abstractions.},

abstract={Computing platforms are expected to be deeply embedded within physical objects and people, creating an Internet of Things. These embedded computing platforms will enable a wide spectrum of applications, including implantable and wearable medical devices, smart homes, smart meters, brain-machine interfaces, physical infrastructure monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems. Unfortunately, the explosion in devices and connectivity creates a much larger attack surface, opening up new opportunities for malicious people and entities. Unless significant attention is paid to security, the Internet of Things could well be turned into an Internet of “Things to be Hacked”! In this paper, we provide an overview of trends in embedded computing and highlight their implications on secure embedded system design. While embedded security is not a new topic, we argue that the characteristics and usage models of emerging embedded computing platforms necessitate a fresh look at embedded security and new approaches to secure embedded system design. We discuss the challenges using two case studies, viz., medical devices and smart homes. We provide examples of hypothetical and real security attacks, discuss the unique security challenges faced by these systems, and describe some initial efforts towards addressing them.},

abstract={A technology has been developed for the extreme miniaturization of lithium ion micro batteries using wafer level processing. These batteries will be used as electronic buffer storage in future miniaturized sensor nodes, data loggers, RFID devices and medical applications. The micro batteries can store the energy generated by energy harvesters which are a prerequisite for energy autarkic wireless sensor nodes and enable the technology for ambient intelligence and the internet of things. Between 2000 and 10000 micro batteries can be fabricated on one 300 mm wafer, being a low cost process. Process optimization of silicon processing was necessary to define cavities for the electrochemical electrodes, current collectors and contacts. The active masses are applied by means of dispensing. Technology development was required to optimize the electrode pastes and electrolyte for application in micro channel structures. Thus a wide variety of state of the art electrode materials can be used and the battery parameters can be tailored according to their application. A novel battery design was tested with anode and cathode fabricated side by side in a planar arrangement. Electrode width and depth as well as electrolyte thickness are the main design parameters to achieve sufficient current capability which is required for wireless sensor nodes.},

abstract={The rapid developments in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication make it necessary to design communication systems operating in different wireless spectrum as an alternative to highly congested wireless access systems. In addition, the deployment of wireless smart meter devices is ramping up and it is expected that such devices will flood the market in the near future competing for the same wireless spectrum. The IEEE 802.11ah standardization task group is developing a global Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard that will allow wireless access using carrier frequencies below 1 GHz in the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band and will help Wi-Fi-enabled devices to get guaranteed access for short-burst data transmissions, such as meter data. In addition to exploiting the underutilized sub 1 GHz spectrum the improved coverage range allows new applications to emerge such as wide area based sensor networks, sensor backhaul systems and potential Wi-Fi off-loading functions. This paper summarizes the IEEE 802.11ah standardization activities in progress and discusses advantages and challenges in the design of physical layer (PHY) and media access control (MAC) schemes in the sub 1 GHz band.},

abstract={A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and evolving concept that provides connectivity to the Internet via sensing devices to achieve intelligent identification and management in a heterogeneous connectivity environment. From the assisted living perspective, this emerging concept will enable new communication connectivity routes between elderly disabled patient and care services through innovative networking architectures in AAL environments. M-health is defined as "mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care" [1]. This evolutionary concept provides both mobility and 'always connected' functionalities for different healthcare applications. In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services.

In this paper, we investigate the application of IoT in the area of pervasive medicine. We propose a practical network architecture for local medicine and health system based on GSM/3G/Internet infrastructure and Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN), called Community Medical Networks (CMN). CMN needs lower cost for deployment, supports user's mobility, can reduce the time and cost of diagnosis and treatment of diseases (especially chronic/paroxysmal diseases) as well as realizes individualization (patient-centered), cooperation and data-sharing in a distributed manner. We describe the implementation of CMN in detail in application level and operation level (business model). We also analyze the requirement of traffic related parameters of CMN when using WCDMA and Zigbee-based WBASN. A promising use case of CMN for heart disease is given to illustrate the feasibility, economical and social benefit of implementing CMN in typical Chinese cities.},

title={A Novel Grading Biomarker for the Prediction of Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease},
year={2017},
volume={64},
number={1},
pages={155-165},
abstract={Objective: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not only crucial in clinical practice, but also has a significant potential to enrich clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD con- ersion.},

abstract={Mobile health (m-Health) is one potential application of cyber-physical systems, where biomedical sensors and mobile devices interact tightly together to transmit medical data to an m-Health server. In this paper, we consider a three-tier hierarchical m-Health system: 1) the sensor network tier capturing vital signals; 2) the mobile computing network tier processing and routing the sensed data to a fixed remote location; and 3) the back-end network tier processing and analyzing the sensed medical data along with patient’s medical history. Based on this architecture, a physical layer security scheme for the second tier is developed and network performance of the introduced scheme is analyzed under different metrics using stochastic geometry. To be specific, secure transmission range and average end-to-end delay are analyzed for two different strategies: the mobile device transmits: 1) to the nearest neighbor and 2) to the furthest neighbor. Furthermore, we consider the cases of full knowledge on eavesdroppers’ locations and when such information is unavailable. Results show that transmitting to the nearest neighbor achieves the highest secure transmission distance with the lowest mean delay when full information on eavesdroppers is available.},

abstract={Nowadays state of the art health care systems are either based on hospital or household environs and its scope is confined to urban areas of a country. Yet traditional healthcare systems are facing challenges such as lack of ubiquity, use of backdated techniques, inadequacies in tracking, observing and reporting status of patients and diseases as well as unaffordability. However, modern updates in IoT, cloud computing, mobile and web development and computer vision technology are offering us a wider scope in providing an effective health care system to everyone. The assistance includes automation in systematic monitoring of patients, transmission of medical data at real-time, saving those data in cloud servers, manipulate data for future use, presenting real time scenario to stake holders and many more. Here we suggest a wireless network infrastructure that will provide useful health and medical services to children and adults as well as assist in distributing vaccines, tablets and personnel to monitor endemic diseases. We have two components in our system, first one is the clinic booth accompanied by health workers. This system assists health workers in their work and acquire personalized data and sends them to an online server for future use. Second is the administration and presentation of the ground data to stake holders. In our preliminary network evaluation of the IoT powered clinic booth design we found average response time of 1.5 seconds with uptime of 98.16%.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage. The analyzed sensor data is sent back to the mobile application on the smartphone for real-time visualization if required.},

abstract={There is a significant increase of strokes, heart diseases and premature death, people need more than ever to be aware of their vital signs such as blood pressure, heart beats, cholesterol level etc. Monitoring and analysing this medical data can help increase the awareness of the risk factor of heart disease. However, there is a huge pressure on medical staff and general practitioners (GPs), therefore this research proposes a medical data analysis based on Nao robots to meet these needs and it will serve as an automated approach towards a robotics real-time interaction with the human body. The proposed research offers a new way to allow users to understand the meaning of their vital signs using a human robot interaction. The developed system has been tested on publicly available data and simulated data. It can predict the future risk of heart disease based on some data attributes. Based on the risk prediction, it can feedback the result and the required lifestyle changes to avoid any related risk.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a competent and structured approach to handle service deliverance aspects of healthcare in terms of mobile health and remote patient monitoring. IoT generates an unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud computing. But for real-time remote health monitoring applications, the delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient’s real-time data at Fog Layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index (THI) of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed BBN classifier based model has high accuracy and response time in determining the state of an event when compared with other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

abstract={It is time for clinician to be more elegant in diagnosis, and at the same time the patient to be taken care of in an all-round way. The improving and opening of the health and medical data, as well as the wide use of the environment and the human body sensors, gives us the opportunity to do so. This paper proposes an "observant clinician and touchable patient" integrated architecture (OCTOPIA), which is for both clinician and patient and extendible. On the basis of integrated medical knowledge, human health and environmental data, OCTOPIA interacts with the patient in a heuristic way to analyze the patient's symptoms and likely diseases. Then, comprehensive data information will be presented to the clinician. In all key links, clinicians will have the opportunity to use their own experience to influence the final diagnosis. Broadly, OCTOPIA consists of five major components: data capture, symptom-disease graph, QA system, ranking likely diseases and visualization. This paper proposes an architecture integrating the environment and human body information, and presents the solutions of an interactive QA system for symptom, a multi-factor calculation model for disease and a visualization design. With the help of OCTOPIA, the patient's information and the state of the environment are more fully perceived, while clinician can make a more detailed diagnosis.},

abstract={Health is closely related to everyone. Integrating different medical data sets will bring tremendous value for human. Basing on Chinese and English disease medical term, we use text mining technique in terms of two dimensions of the disease from the name and text description of the semantic clustering to achieve initial alignment disease terminology. First, we translate the Chinese data set through the API translation. Then we assign weights for each feature item to obtain feature vector for each disease node disease. Finally, we calculate the similarity of diseases and K-means clustering. We conduct experiments to evaluate the method on real-world and authoritative dataset, and the results prove that it has better rationality and superiority. The method can be extended to the initial alignment of multilingual texts with the same concept after improving.},

abstract={The construction of medical database has been constructed to some degrees, but the data redundancy between many medical sets has great influence on searching cross different sets. In this paper, the first step is to use three major domestic medical sets as the foundation of the research. And the Natural Language processing technologies is applied to realize the segmentation of disease description. Then, we use TF-IDF to calculate the weight of the feature words in the disease description, and establish the disease feature vector. Based on this vector, the similarity of disease feature vectors is measured by the cosine similarity method. Finally, the effect of k-means and k-center clustering algorithm on the alignment of the disease text is compared. The experimental results show that the k-center clustering algorithm has better performance compared to k-means. And the result of the clustering is reasonable to some extent.},

abstract={Patients with chronic diseases are required to self-manage their conditions. Patients are normally advised to adapt to healthier life-style, and in the meantime to continuously monitor the relevant biomarkers. Recent technology advances in monitoring devices, such as activities waist bands and glucose sensors, made it much easier for the patients to monitor the level of activities and biomarkers in home environment. The aim is to assist patients in making informed decisions and the key feature to achieve will be based on thoroughly understand the meaning of the collected data with the help of known facts (knowledge). However, interpreting the meaning of the monitored data is a challenging task for an ordinary patient. Data visualization techniques play an important role in helping users to understand and interpret data via exploration. In this paper, we present data visualization diagrams that are used in CARRE project to help both medical professional and patients to understand the disease progressions.},

abstract={Devices used in Internet of Things (IoT) technology are interconnected through internet and continuously send data for storage in disparate databases and files. This poses heterogeneity in data syntax and semantics. In the past few years, researches have been carried out to handle these problems in various information systems such as water and healthcare by applying semantic and syntactic uniformity. This research presents an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework to sustain the interoperability between stakeholders within an information system by applying Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) paradigm and ontology. The major contribution of this research is building software model which is annotated with semantic model to maintain the comprehension between the modelers and the programmers allowing sustainability by adapting to the changing environment. Moreover, the framework offers two types of semantic validation i.e. model and data of the documents to integrate sensor data which we claim as a novelty in this study. The validated IoT data is integrated through RESTful web service interface of SensorThings API. The aim of this paper is to apply the methodology of the framework, on IoT based healthcare system, that has been successful in water information system.},

title={Uncertainty Investigation for Personalised Lifelogging Physical Activity Intensity Pattern Assessment with Mobile Devices},
year={2017},
volume={},

pages={871-876},
abstract={Lifelogging physical activity (PA) assessment is crucial to healthcare technologies and studies for the purpose of treatments and interventions of chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies. Whilst PA activity monitoring by mobile phone is still a challenging issue by far due to much more uncertainties than wearable devices.},

The research applies data mining techniques to the medical literatures and evidences on prostate cancer, with the aim to unravel the relationships between the presence of having multiple lifestyle factors and prostate cancer effective of occurrence of multiple factors. The research is to establish a possible predictive model based on theorized and proven risk factors and associations used in prostate cancer research. This paper describes the use of data mining algorithms on the risk factors to identify hidden knowledge. Firstly, an association rule mining algorithm is employed to identify the significant risk factors for the predictive modeling, based on the support level in terms of research materials used and confidence values. Secondly, the chosen factors were combined, modelled and visually represented to show their probability risks in relation to each other and the disease.},

abstract={In this study, an algorithm for arrhythmia classification that conforms to the recommended practice by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) is presented. Our approach efficiently exploits the inherent sparse representation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. It involves, first, designing a separate dictionary for each Arrhythmia class. To this end, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the K-SVD, a dictionary learning algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD) approach, are applied. Sparse representations, based on new designed dictionaries, of each new test QRS complex are then calculated and assigned to the class associated with the largest Pietra Index (PI) afterwards. Our experiments showed promising results with accuracies ranging between 80 % and 100 %.},

abstract={Designing efficient strategies of reducing health care costs and optimizing facility utilization has long be a pursue of health systems, and stratifying patients into different expenditure/utilization patterns and further profiling these patient groups can provide useful clues for the strategy design. In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases. Overall, this study can usefully promote the development of healthcare-strategy design and implementation.},

abstract={With the widespread use of IoT devices in safety-critical applications, new constraints should be addressed in designing IoT infrastructures. Reliability is one of the most important characteristics of an IoT system which should be satisfied with high consideration. The way how IoT devices communicate with each other in different layers of architecture, plays an important role in building a reliable IoT infrastructure. Maintaining the desired level of reliability in IoT applications through application layer protocols, imposes a noticeable amount of overhead to different characteristics of IoT systems. In this paper, we are going to investigate these overheads through practical evaluations on a conventional IoT infrastructure. To this end, we will compare two well-known application layer protocols, i.e., MQTT with many reliable features and CoAP with fewer reliability mechanisms, from different aspects. Conducted experiments in Arduino test-beds illustrate while MQTT provides more reliable and predictable infrastructure for IoT devices, on average, it imposes 364uW of more power consumption than CoAP for delivering the same amount of data. Furthermore, utilizing MQTT as a reliable application layer protocol, imposes 4.99x of more latency in comparison with CoAP.},

abstract={Mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs) have arisen as a very promising brandnew healthcare system, which will greatly improve the quality of life. Moreover, with the help of Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any Trusted Third Party (TTP). Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching. Finally, we do comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world smartphones to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed schemes.},

abstract={In recent studies Machine Learning is regarded to be one of the disruptive technologies that will transform our future life, business and the global economy. In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs — and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation — are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed. This does not apply to computer science programs alone but also to other fields of study.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel design of an Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine based health monitoring system-The Smart Chair. Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities. The results presented show that the proposed system is definitely a low cost affordable solution for IoT based telemedicine system, as compared to existing systems.},

abstract={Smart Healthcare is envisioned as the combination of traditional healthcare augmented by smart bio-sensors, wearable devices and a plethora of on-body sensors that communicate with smart hospitals, smart emergency response systems, and ambulances, through advanced information and communication technologies. The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. The present paper address some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a Secure Digital Camera (SDC) integrated with the Secure Better Portable Graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this work is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection: concurrent encryption and watermarking which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management (DRM). The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: (1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image, and (2) frequency domain watermarking using block-wise DCT of size 8×8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant incre- se of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.},

abstract={Modern daily activities make some people have difficulty to care about his health. Urban air pollution, work pressure, and irregular diet increase the risk of such a person to become infected. In fact, some of the diseases would not cause any symptoms prior to severe ones. One of them is the coronary heart disease. According to a study conducted by the WHO (World Health Organization), in 2030 an estimated 23 million lives lost each year from cardiovascular disease. This value will continue to grow if no proper solution is found. Internet of Things (IoT) technology developments allow humans to control a variety of high-tech equipment in our daily lives. One of these is the ease of checking health using gadgets, either a phone, tablet or laptop. This paper describes the use of IoT technology for measuring the human heart rate that can be monitored using the gadget. As the result of this application, people can easily monitor their heart rate.},

title={Improved Reconstruction of Low Intensity Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with Weighted Low Rank Hankel Matrix Completion},
year={2018},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) has many important applications in medical imaging, biology and chemistry. The one dimensional MRS is too crowded for complex samples to retrieve chemical or biological information. Two dimensional MRS unfolds the spectrum by introducing another dimension at the cost of much longer data acquisition time. To speed up the data acquisition, one typical way is to sparsely acquire measurements and then reconstruct the spectrum from incomplete observations. Recently, a low rank Hankel matrix (LRHM) approach has shown great potential to reconstruct the spectrum basing on the assumption that the number of spectral peaks is much less than the number of acquired data points. However, low intensity spectral peaks are compromised in the reconstruction when the data are highly undersampled. In this paper, a weighted LRHM approach is proposed to tackle this problem. A weighted nuclear norm is introduced to better approximate the rank constraint and a prior signal space is estimated from the pre-reconstruction to reduce the unknowns in reconstruction. Experimental results on both synthetic and real MRS data demonstrate that the proposed approach can reconstruct low intensity spectral peaks better than the state-of-the-art LRHM method.},

abstract={This paper proposes a framework for the system engineering approach to the Internet of Things (IoT) implementation in a country. The approach utilizes a system of hierarchical levels providing the perspectives of the “world view”, “domain view” and “element view” of IoT service applications. The world view of IoT is further refined into the domain views of the three actors which each have a specific domain of interest in a country-related dimension. These are the domains of the Policy Maker, the Industry, and the Market. Each of the domain views are then elaborated into several element views. The main contribution of this study is that the proposed framework can be used for guidance by policy makers - in particular, in a developing country which has just begun to consider a massive implementation of IoT services. As a new form of technology, IoT has some opportunities, as well as its challenges. This framework may help policy makers to identify crucial issues that need to be addressed.},

abstract={Healthcare industry has proven its technically abundant applications at par other industries with the help of many concepts like IoT and cloud computing. It has transformed its techniques by using intelligent gadgets that can be acquainted with patients in different configurations. The data obtained from devices like pulse rate monitors, weighing scales, blood glucose measuring devices, etc. is to be stocked and tracked as awareness of health statistics is vital for all. A hefty portion of these measures requires a follow-off with a specialist. This commences the preference of using IoT based smart devices to deliver more valuable data to the patient and drop off the necessity for direct patient-doctor interaction. Improving the standard of service, it brings particularly high value for the patients requiring constant supervision and quick data access and analysis. This paper will demonstrate automatic communication between the smart devices and android mobile application via Bluetooth and data storage on Cloud. Also, it shows automatic control over oxygen cylinder using mobile app for admitted patients who require supplementary oxygen. Thus, our system serves the purpose of minimizing doctors' efforts and providing seamless experience to the patient with IoT, Cloud and Wireless Technology like Bluetooth helping in saving millions of lives.},

abstract={The ADHD (Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity) is a brain disorder and whose main characteristics are inattention, restlessness and impulsivity. It has its onset in childhood (it occurs in 3 to 5% of the children in the world), being able to accompany the individual throughout its life, although some symptoms become more soft throughout the life.In adults, most problems are related to the difficulty of organizing, planning, managing time, remembering dates, appointments, objects, among others. With the advancement of technology, several solutions have emerged to help our day-to-day life, as well as for peoples with some type of disability, giving them a greater autonomy.In this context, we have the IoT (Internet of Things), one of the solutions with great potential to provide this autonomy, since we can provide several devices, for example, to monitor our blood pressure or body temperature, without the need to be in a hospital.This work proposes a solution, based on IoT, to help the daily activities of an adult person with ADHD. For this, was developed a tool that is able to remember activities and possible lost objects. The evaluation carried out over the proposed solution was based on a questionnaire applied to specialized professionals. The results obtained so far, show that the tool has demonstrated a great potential to help people with ADHD.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},

abstract={Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of death and disability with over 3.8 million annual cases and 130 daily deaths in the United States alone. Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.},

Specifically, we place all the ECG electrodes behind the ear to enhance the wearability, and weak/noisy ear-ECG is obtained. Then, we use a support vector machine classifier for heartbeat identification, apply an unsupervised learning approach for heartbeat purification, and a regression model to derive the standard chest-ECG QRS durations from the ear-ECG QRS durations. We have evaluated the proof-of-concept system using an ear-ECG dataset acquired by a semi-customized wearable prototype, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.

volume={65},
number={1},
pages={141-153},
abstract={Ultra-low-voltage (ULV) satisfies the energy-constraint on-die acceleration of parallel processing in battery-powered Internet-of-Things applications. However, ULV brings serious leakage energy, throughput reduction, and delay variation issues. Parallel bit-serialization remarkably reduces leakage energy and enhances area efficiency; however, extremely reduced critical path aggravates delay variation makes bit-serial operation not feasible to ULV design. In this paper, we propose a balanced-bit-serial adder (BBSA) as a basic unit of parallel-balanced-bit-serialization (PBBS) operation, which leverages timing borrowing to mitigate delay variation. In addition, we propose two latches to improve the effectiveness of timing borrowing and ease the area and power overhead of BBSA. The proposed BBSA is verified in TSMC 40-nm CMOS technology. Compared with the flip-flop-based bit-serial adder, energy consumption of BBSA is saved by 40% and area efficiency is improved by 15% as well. As a practical demonstration, we present a reconfigurable PBBS single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vector processing tile. The post-layout simulation shows that the proposed design has advantage of overall area efficiency and has significant energy saving as compared with the state-of-art ULV SIMD tile.},

abstract={This paper describes the experimentation architecture of Internet of Things (IoT) in real life. Objective of this work is to design water bottles which intimate a person to intake water on time to keep body temperature in stable. With busy schedules of humans and endless distractions, it's hard to remember to drink enough water by the humans. One of the health issues is not drinking sufficient amount of water properly in a human's daily life. Here the water float sensor can be used to sense the level of the water and it not only helps the users to measure the level of water, but also indicates the human to drink water when it's time to top up their body. This is a user-friendly project, that water bottle or flask can speaks with the person via passing commands as a message to drink sufficient water. The IoT experiment facility describes in this paper is conceived to provide a suitable platform for a large scale experimentation and evaluation of IoT concept under real life conditions.},

abstract={The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.},

These are compiled, optimised, and partitioned to meet the non-functional requirements using database system techniques and cost models extended to meet the needs of IoT analytics. The paper describes the PATH2iot system, illustrated by a real-world digital healthcare analytics example, with sensor battery life as the main non-functional requirement to be optimised. It shows that the tool can automatically partition and distribute the computation across a healthcare wearable, a mobile phone and the cloud - increasing the battery life of the smart watch by 416% when compared to other possible allocations. The PATH2iot system can therefore automatically bring the benefits of fog/edge computing to IoT applications.},

abstract={With the development of medical sensors and IoT, personalized service assisted elder and patient living is a critical service in IoT-based healthcare application. However, the scale and complexity of personalized service is increasing because of ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of medical sensors, which cause response time increase and resource waste. Therefore, leveraging the advantage of complex event processing (CEP) in data stream processing, we propose a hierarchical fog-cloud computing CEP architecture for personalized service to accelerate response time and reduce resource waste. Firstly, we introduce the proposed architecture, which includes sensor layer, fog layer and cloud layer. Secondly, we propose a series of optimizations for the architecture, there are a partitioning and clustering approach and a communication and parallel processing policy to optimize the fog and cloud computing.

abstract={Internet of Things is the new revolution that is going to impact every facet of our lives. Internet of Things (IoT) is the new technology which includes the collection of Sensors, Actuators, processors and other development boards (eg. Raspberry pi, Arduino etc) to collect the data from different sources depending upon domain of application, process the acquired data before sending to distant cloud or mobile application depending upon the requirement[7]. The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe. MQTT is a lightweight protocol which is developed for a machine to machine (M2M) communication.},

abstract={Mobile personal devices, such as smartphones, USB thumb drives, and sensors, are becoming essential elements of our modern lives. Their large-scale pervasive deployment within the population has already attracted many malware authors, cybercriminals, and even governments. Since the first demonstration of mobile malware by Marcos Velasco, millions of these have been developed with very sophisticated capabilities. They infiltrate highly secure networks using air-gap jumping capability (e.g., “Hammer Drill” and “Brutal Kangaroo”) and spread through heterogeneous computing and communication platforms. Some of these cross-platform malware attacks are capable of infiltrating isolated control systems which might be running a variety of operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Linux. This paper investigates cross-platform/heterogeneous mobile malware that uses removable media, such as USB connection, to spread between incompatible computing platforms and operating systems. Deep analysis and modeling of cross-platform mobile malware are conducted at the micro (infection) and macro (spread) levels. The micro-level analysis aims to understand the cross-platform malware states and transitions between these states during node-to-node infection. The micro-level analysis helps derive the parameters essential for macro-level analysis, which are also crucial for the elaboration of suitable detection and prevention solutions. The macro-level analysis aims to identify the most important factors affecting cross-platform mobile malware spread within a digitized population. Through simulation, we show that identifying these factors helps to mitigate any outbreaks.},

abstract={Designing circuits for enhanced IoT (“Internet of Things”) applications is one of the current growth driver for the electronics industry. Optimizing such circuits for lowest power consumption while maximize functionality and performance is key for successful implementation of such circuits in the IoT systems. IoT devices are diverse in nature but are typically constrained by limited power availability, limited area budget and the need for modularity of design. The burden of ultra-low-power budget unfortunately doesn't necessarily mean that other performance requirements are relaxed. The tutorial is therefore geared towards designers of IoT devices including sensors, MEMS, mobile devices, medical sensors, wireless communication devices, near field communication devices, energy harvesting designs, mobile devices, and wireless communication devices. It will focus on how automated circuit sizing and tuning methodologies can be used to enhance existing design expertise to reduce power consumption while trade-off with other circuit performances. Additionally it will be shown how features like circuit sensitivity analysis can be used for confirming design hypotheses. Using such a verification and optimization environment can help systematically and fully explore design's operating, design and statistical design space.},

abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},

abstract={Common hospital monitoring set up includes nurses taking rounds throughout their assigned wards and checking the patient's vital signs. This process is very time consuming and prone to human errors, especially for large scale hospitals. As a solution, an Internet of Things (IoT) based pulmonary monitoring system was proposed. The system uses a single-lead heart rate sensor connected to a microcontroller that is plugged to a computer that has an application which is capable of processing pulmonary rates by passing the data to a C# and MATLAB program and plotting waveforms from the derivation of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings (ECG-Derived Respiration or EDR), and forward the information to the Internet to be stored in a database. The collected information can be viewed in a website and accessed by relevant individuals (doctors and patient's relative). The critical value generated from the t-test is 1.701 and 2.048 for the one-tail and two-tail test, respectively. These values lie in the non-critical region indicating that there was no significant difference between the two sample sets. The average percent difference between the EDR rates is 4.1362%. The percent reliability in detecting respiration conditions is 93.3333%.

abstract={In 2015, Zheng & Carter warned that the Internet of Things (IoT) would have an exponential deployment in all types of industry in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. In the military sphere, it has not been different. The Ecuadorian Armed Forces are trying to equip their soldiers with IoT Technology to monitor and visualize in real time the state of health during combat missions. However, the implementation and research, at least in Ecuador; has been very complex due to two problems: (1) organization in the design and the integration of the components and applications when participate several researchers and engineers of multiple disciplines (e.g, control, software) and (2) the complex implementation due to the technological fragmentation between the military contexts (e.g., air force, army and navy). We propose an approach to the solution to the implementation of real-time military health monitoring in combat missions, using the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm and the research model proposed by Takeuchi & Nonaka. We were able to obtain a meta-model delineated in the 4 domains of the IoT Technology embedded within the 4 contexts of a product line process. The meta-model has solved the problem associated with implementation as a product line while had increasing the comprehensibility between researchers and engineers.},

abstract={An interesting application of the prospective technology called Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is in the territory of the medicine. It's expected that this technology plays the role as tool of surveillance of the functionalities of the human organs. To accomplish that, the deployment of nanodevices very near to organs should be a must. However, the idea to deploy nanodevices should be sustained in basis of basic processes, as the ones of physics for instance. In this paper, a physics model based on electrodynamics describing all those processes of anomalous fluxing of albumin in the very beginning of the diabetes kidney disease (DKD), and tested with the assistance of the Monte Carlo method is presented. According to the simulations, signal can be identified in those scenarios where is assumed that the nanosensor has the capabilities to defeat noise or background substantially. For these studies, we have associated an error of simulation of order of 15%.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a pervasive presence of interconnected and uniquely identifiable physical devices. These devices' goal is to gather data and drive actions in order to improve productivity, and ultimately reduce or eliminate reliance on human intervention for data acquisition, interpretation, and use. The proliferation of these connected low-power devices will result in a data explosion that will significantly increase data transmission costs with respect to energy consumption and latency. Edge computing reduces these costs by performing computations at the edge nodes, prior to data transmission, to interpret and/or utilize the data. While much research has focused on the IoT's connected nature and communication challenges, the challenges of IoT embedded computing with respect to device microprocessors has received much less attention. This paper explores IoT applications' execution characteristics from a microarchitectural perspective and the microarchitectural characteristics that will enable efficient and effective edge computing. To tractably represent a wide variety of next-generation IoT applications, we present a broad IoT application classification methodology based on application functions, to enable quicker workload characterizations for IoT microprocessors. We then survey and discuss potential microarchitectural optimizations and computing paradigms that will enable the design of right-provisioned microprocessors that are efficient, configurable, extensible, and scalable. This paper provides a foundation for the analysis and design of a diverse set of microprocessor architectures for next-generation IoT devices.},

It has always said that Health is Wealth. However, in the recent years people have been spending most of their hard-earned money in Hospitals and medicines. Thus, it proves our negligence towards our health. Not only that, but also many people are moving abroad leaving their old parents in their hometowns and not being able to keep a track of the health of each other. With this thought in our minds, we decided to do something that will make it easier for people to keep a track of their loved one's health as well as their own. With the evolution of internet everything is possible on it, from finding information to tracking locations nearby. Internet has become a savior for the world today. Internet of Things is taking a step ahead in helping the world be even more connected. Therefore, we decided on making an IoT based Health Monitoring System.

abstract={Brain Computer Interface (BCI) has recently gained much popularity due to plethora of its applications. In this paper, we propose a novel system architecture to utilize brain signals for controlling Internet of Things enabled environments. The proposed architecture aids in translating brain signals to commands that interact with or control the environment using IoT actuation networks thus executing user desired actions. It comprises of novel, low complex and low power intelligent signal processing architecture for detection of voluntary eye blinks by isolating involuntary eye blinks and IoT enabled wireless actuation network for controlling the environment using commands generated from EEG signal. For the real time performance analysis of the proposed architecture, we developed a wearable device which acquires dual channel EEG using electrodes at Fp1 and Fp2 locations. From the acquired EEG data, the device detects the voluntary eye blinks of the patient and use this information in controlling the environment such as switching HVAC system, lighting or electric fan etc. Performance analysis shows that the proposed intelligent signal processing architecture detects the voluntary eye blinks with 95.2% accuracy when tested on 10 subjects with a low power consumption of 165 mW.},

IOT based E-Health Systems provides healthcare services across a series of interconnected networks and IoT devices. In such type of systems data security remains to be the major issue as the data generated from the E-health systems are accessed by the variety of users for medication, diagnosis, and research purposes. Even an outbreak of the single GB of the health data creates serious impacts as they are highly confidential in nature. Thus, an effective security measure across the IoT-based E-health systems has become the primary requirement. Further, the underlying architecture of the IoT-based E-health systems also greatly influences the data management and security issues.

One such application, which we will discuss in details, is a ground breaking self-powered IoT SoC platform for wearable health care. More specifically we will present a novel fully integrated ECG signal processing system for the prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using a unique set of ECG features extracted from two consecutive cardiac cycles. Two databases of the heart signal recordings from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the MIT PhysioNet were used as training, test and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The system achieved an accuracy of 99%. The ECG signal is sensed using a flexible, dry, Graphene-based technology and the system is powered up by harvesting human thermal energy. The system architecture is implemented in Global foundries' 65 nm CMOS process, occupies 0.112 mm2 and consumes 2.78 micro Watt at an operating frequency of10 KHz and from a supply voltage of 1.2V.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.},

With smart sensing and remote monitoring, peoples' health conditions can be assessed more effectively but to provide IoT services such as depressive disorder assistance still, there are many challenges to overcome. A huge number of connected heterogeneous devices and enormous amounts of data generated by these devices are not only difficult to manage but providing services with them in a dynamic IoT environment, count for significant efforts. There is a requirement for mechanisms that not only cater the heterogeneity of IoT devices but also provide dynamic services efficiently based on user requirements. Web of Objects (WoO) platform enables IoT services by virtualizing real world objects using semantic ontology. It provides a base for the development of interoperable microservices which support dynamic features by utilizing streams of sensory data. This paper proposes a Microservices Model in WoO based IoT platform to provide services for depressive disorder assistance. In addition, a Real World Knowledge (RWK) model of user situations and emotions has also been developed.},

abstract={With the need for increased care and welfare of the rapidly aging population, mobile telemedicine is becoming popular for providing remote health care to increase the quality of life. Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the “edge”, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920×1080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3×3 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has taken over the business spectrum, and its applications vary widely from agriculture and health care to transportation. A hospital environment can be very stressful, especially for senior citizens and children. With the ever-increasing world population, the conventional patient-doctor appointment has lost its effectiveness. Hence, smart health care becomes very important. Smart health care can be implemented at all levels, starting from temperature monitoring for babies to tracking vital signs in the elderly. The complexity and cost of implementation varies based on the required precision of the individual device, functionalities, and sophistication of the application for which they are used. Smart health care also falls under vertical areas such as very-large-scale integration, embedded system, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. This article discusses the importance, requirements, application of smart health care along with the current industry trends and products. It gives a deeper insight about the different platform across which more research can be pursued in this dynamic domain.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and prototype of a wireless health monitoring system using mobile phone accessories. We focus on measuring real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitoring using a smartphone case. With the increasing number of cardiac patients worldwide, this design can be used for early detection of heart diseases. Unlike most of the existing methods that use an optical sensor to monitor heart rate, our approach is to measure real-time ECG with dry electrodes placed on smartphone case. The collected ECG signal can be stored and analyzed in real time through a smartphone application for prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed hardware system consists of a single chip microcontroller (RFduino) embedded with Bluetooth low energy, hence miniaturizing the size and prolonging battery life. The system called “smart case” has been tested in a laboratory environment. We also designed a 3-D printed smartphone case to validate the feasibly of the system. The results demonstrated that the proposed system could be comparable to medical grade devices.},

abstract={With the exponential growth of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), new security challenges have emerged. Various vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, and controls have been introduced for the new generation of CPS. However, there lacks a systematic review of the CPS security literature. In particular, the heterogeneity of CPS components and the diversity of CPS systems have made it difficult to study the problem with one generalized model. In this paper, we study and systematize existing research on CPS security under a unified framework. The framework consists of three orthogonal coordinates: 1) from the security perspective, we follow the well-known taxonomy of threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and controls; 2) from the CPS components perspective, we focus on cyber, physical, and cyber-physical components; and 3) from the CPS systems perspective, we explore general CPS features as well as representative systems (e.g., smart grids, medical CPS, and smart cars). The model can be both abstract to show general interactions of components in a CPS application, and specific to capture any details when needed. By doing so, we aim to build a model that is abstract enough to be applicable to various heterogeneous CPS applications; and to gain a modular view of the tightly coupled CPS components. Such abstract decoupling makes it possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight the potential sources of attacks and ways of protection. With this intensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the state-of-the-art on CPS security, provide researchers with a comprehensive list of references, and also encourage the audience to further explore this emerging field.},

abstract={Cyber-physical system (CPS), regarded as the next generation of engineered system, has the capability to interact with the real physical world. Applications of CPS span various fields such as medical monitoring, traffic control, and smart grid. With such widespread applications, privacy assurance is becoming more and more important since what the CPS connects are people and the real world. Any leakage of private information will cause serious consequences. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the secrecy of wireless communications in CPS by use of physical layer security techniques. Specifically, we study an amplify and forward (AF) relay network where all devices are equipped with a single antenna. We propose a privacy-enhanced waveform design approach aided by artificial noise (AN) to enhance the communication secrecy in a wireless environment with multipath receptions. First, we consider the case with perfect eavesdropper’s channel state information (CSI). We optimize the AF coefficient for forwarding the information-bearing signal and the AN covariance to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. The optimal solution is obtained by solving a series of semidefinite programs. Then, a more practical scenario with imperfect eavesdropper’s CSI is studied. We develop a robust waveform design method and obtain the lower bound of the achievable secrecy rate. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

abstract={- IoT is becoming very relevant and getting popular in the field of medical diagnosis nowadays. In this paper, we are bound to limelight in this field which focuses briefly over the child health monitoring. In this work, we implemented a smart and secure health care monitor application that personify the monitoring of total health and mind status of the children. As part of which we are adopting the use of wireless sensors that will keep the child to get monitored. Our system enables the child to get involved with some android games which will make him/her to think and act dynamically. The game scores and the sensor readings obtained from the child will be monitored and analyzed by the system and actions will be taken accordingly. Since the data generated by the system are humongous, we adopt Hadoop in the background to effectively map the data and to reduce it into elementary. As this data need confidentiality in transmission, Apache Ranger is being used for the secure transmission and for the classification of the child behavior, C4.5 decision algorithm is used in the system. While testing with the medical dataset, C4.5 proved to be more accurate than ID3 algorithm.},

abstract={Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common causes of hospitalization for people over 65 years old, and over half of patients who diagnosed with severe HF conditions at first time cannot survive over 5 years. It is also noticed that rehospitalization rate of heart failure patients may increase to 50% in three months and the mortality rate from 33% to 50% within five years if HF patients are not treated with proper medication and physical therapies. Here we provide a classification system and an early warning mechanism for detecting HF disease based on integrating 6-minute walking test (6MWT), Internet of medical thing devices, and cloud computing technologies. This study performed 6MWTs for 50 HF patients accompanied by medical staffs for recording walkway distance, walking heart rate, and resting heart rate. All retrieved features and classified functional levels of heart organ of HF patients are trained as a target referencing dataset. According to the selected features and trained results, the clustered information representing various heart conditions is applied for detecting potential HF patients at earlier stages. In addition, the newly obtained self-exercise rehabilitation records from HF patients in a real-time manner will be compared to her/his previous 6MWT patterns. The compared differences are considered as important information for doctors to arrange medical treatment and adjusted physical therapy during the next follow-up visit in hospital.},

abstract={Most current studies of epileptic seizure detection disclose that "Despite the design of new anti-epileptic drugs, drug resistant epilepsy still lacks an ultimate solution" [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'. This way a personalised monitoring plan (PMP) for each individual epilepsy patient can be realised.},

pages={392-404},
abstract={A brain-computer interface (BCI) for seizure prediction provides a means of controlling epilepsy in medically refractory patients whose site of epileptogenicity cannot be resected but yet can be defined sufficiently to be selectively influenced by strategically implanted electrodes. Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.},

abstract={Advances in the information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Thing (IoT). IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all. This paper is a review of Healthcare Monitoring system using IoT.},

abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a personal area wireless network technology that is of increasing importance for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. By design, BLE supports short-range, single-hop communication between a pair of BLE devices. As such, native BLE does not allow network-based policy control or in-network functions for service enhancement. These limitations are impediments to any large-scale BLE based IoT deployment (e.g., in hospital environments), where such sophisticated network-based visibility and control may be required. Relying on cloud-based solutions to meet these requirements has many known shortcomings. This paper proposes an SDN-based architecture for enabling wide area IoT deployments using BLE devices at the edge. We introduce a programmable BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. BLESS can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller to enable flexible, policy-based switching, as well as various in-network operations in BLE networks. We describe the design of BLESS, its implementation using P4 and OVS, and illustrate its utility through practical use cases.},

year={2017},

abstract={In this work, the advantages of coupling biomedical signal compressors with clinical feature-based distortion measures are demonstrated. Such a coupling allow biomedical signal compressors to self-establish hard limits with regards to choices surrounding compression ratios, or `quality settings', a compressor can safely choose from to guarantee that features of clinical significance are protected so that their reconstruction remains clinically relevant. This coupling allows biomedical signal compressors to operate in an unsupervised manner, since it is demonstrated that establishing hard limits that are applied equally to all signals does not allow one to maximize and/or strike a balance between compression ratio and signal fidelity. Such mechanisms can be employed in communication architectures in wearable body area sensor networks (BASNs) for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications for autonomous tasks. While feature-based distortion measures such as the Clinical Distortion Index (CDI), and the Weighted Distortion Measure (WDD) already exist, we demonstrate the viability of our work by proposing a generalizable feature-based distortion measure we call the Diagnostic Distortion Measure (DDM), which offers several benefits that address a few shortcomings present in the CDI and WDD in real-time applications for unsupervised self-guided compressors. Experimental results show successful application of our DDM with ECG signals from the PhysioNet database.},

abstract={United nation population report predicts that the world population will hit 8 billion by 2026 with hopping 1.5 billion in India. This increased population demands improved medical facilities only to realize there are not adequate doctors on role leading to deaths of nearly 1M Indians every year & approximately 700M deprived of even preliminary health treatment thereby carrying 21% of the global disease burden. In general, doctors are either not willing to serve the rural areas or they are not available 24×7 that is causing rural population to travel to cities even for casual ailments. According to WHO (World Health Organization) reports, India have less than 0.7 doctor /1000 population which is lower as compared to ratio of 4.3 in Russian federation, 3.8 in Argentina, 2.4 in USA & WHO Benchmark. Indian government spends just around 30% of the total budget in healthcare which is a penny in comparison to the USA & the UK. This increased population demands lower operational cost with high accuracy, early detection followed by prevention. In this paper, a futuristic approach is proposed to support the existing healthcare system by designing a preliminary multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair with E-diagnostic feature within a medical booth, analogous to an ATM booth. The attractive part of our system is low priced diagnosis, non-invasiveness, indigenously built medical apparatus, misdiagnosis prevention with fast systematic approach.},

abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in communication technologies have enabled homes, cars even whole cities to be network connected. However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can be considered as a promising solution for detecting, reporting emergency events, eliminating the hoax calls and responding swiftly saving lives.},

abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a low-energy personal area wireless network technology that is of increasing importance for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployment. By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong per-slice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled “switch node”, called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices. We describe the design of BLESS, and illustrate its utility through a few practical use cases.},

In this paper, we present a secure way to control the flow of personal data in the specific case of the recruitment of participants for clinical trials. We take special care to protect the interests of both parties: the individual can keep its data private until an agreement is reached, and the Clinical Research Institute can be assured that it is acquiring useful and authentic data.

abstract={Falls are one of the very serious problems in the healthcare system for the elderly, often resulting in a rapid decline in functionality and death. Serious consequences of sustaining a fall include broken or fractured bones, superficial cuts and abrasions as well as soft tissue damage. Several solutions are proposed to resolve such problems, however, major difficulties they encounter are cost, comfort and performance. In this paper, we propose a new Android application for fall detection based on theory of machine learning and data mining. Concretely, we used a classification method to detect if it is a fall down or another common events (e.g. sitting, jumping, etc.). The obtained experimental results show that our proposal yielded impressive results compared to related works.},

abstract={there is currently a significant amount of technology in hospitals in particular in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). The clinical data daily generated are integrated into Decision Support Systems (DSS), in real time for a better quality of patient care.The hospital environment has many outbreaks of infections, objects or environments in which microorganisms can survive or multiply, such as the facilities, invasive devices or equipment used, or even patients, health professionals and visitors. The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence. This paper presents the results of applying models to real clinical data. Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14). These models, classification models, should act in a DSS capable of helping to reduce this type of infections as well as reduce the costs associated with them.},

pages={233-239},
abstract={This research presents two approaches using microwave signals to detect vital signs of humans equipped with an m-health application. The first approach utilizes phase locked loop (PLL) to multiply the frequency of a very accurate Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS), generating a FMCW signal. The second approach multiplies the generated DDS signal using a frequency multiplier (F12). Counter-intuitive existence of low power harmonics (F13, F14, F11, F10, etc.) in the frequency multiplier added improvements in our tests. Tiny variations in environment are easily observed on specific bars in FFT of down-converted signals in the frequency multiplier approach. Both approaches work by sending a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) that reflects off objects present in the room. Based on the reflected signal, we calculate distances and movements, from which we then extract breathing and heart rates. In both approaches, we try two sets of microwave signals: Triangular FMCW and Sawtooth FMCW. Both approaches showed more obvious variation for body movement. In the case of the Triangular FMCW signal, interpreting data is more challenging. On the other hand, the Sawtooth FMCW signal resulted in clear output but lower power and harder to directly observe.},

abstract={Traditionally, emergency communications between citizens and public authorities relied on legacy telecommunication technologies unable to cope with the agile, rich-media-content communications that mobile users are already using. This is due to the lack of harmonization and interoperable IP-based networking solutions. With the operators currently migrating to broadband IP infrastructures, emergency systems also need to follow this path and adapt their emergency communication platforms to fulfill next generation emergency services regulatory requirements. This becomes even more evident in light of the forthcoming 5G networks, which are envisioned to support an amalgam of diverse applications and services with heterogeneous performance requirements, including mission-critical IoT communication, massive machine-type communication, and gigabit mobile connectivity. Emergency service operators face an enormous challenge in order to synchronize their model of operation with the 5G paradigm. This article studies the challenges that next generation emergency services need to overcome in order to fulfill the requirements for rich-content, real-time, location-specific communications. The concept for next generation emergency communications as described in the project EMYNOS is presented, along with a vision of how this concept can fulfill the 5G requirements for ultra-reliable and ultra-low-latency emergency communications.},

This paradigm, known as Internet of Things (IoT), is steadily consolidated and promises to offer a wide variety of applications. However, with the adoption of IoT, new challenges arise, such as the design of architectures able to support the requirements of the new applications. Towards this goal, we explore a three layered architecture, able to acquire, process and store Healthcare data as well as to provide real-time decision making. We use ECG signal arrhythmia detection as our use case evaluation scenario, and compare different techniques for wireless communication, storage and data classification. Experimental results show that, our architecture provides real-time decision making, with an average delay of 15 μs and that different communication technologies achieved to provide up to 10% lower power consumption on the monitoring devices. 1},

This paper introduces a simulation framework capable of generating and simulating application scenarios of both time-triggered and rate constrained messages with their respective communication schedules with real-time requirements. The scenarios are generated where applications are introduced over time in the SoS. After that, the inputs are processed over time with an incremental scheduler that produces a trace of schedules to be simulated using OPNET. The incremental scheduling problem for the constituent systems is formulated as an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem using IBM CPLEX. In addition, the simulation framework provides verification functions in terms of the evaluation of schedulability and run-time, estimation of worst-case latency for time-triggered and rate-constrained messages.},

abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the healthcare by providing high-quality services, lowering the costs, and increasing the efficiency of management by allowing the physical objects to integrate with computer systems to collect the sensed data and process as per the need. Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario. Finally, the paper concludes with the reported results.},

abstract={Mobile e-health is one of the Internet of Things application that assists the healthcare organization in providing better healthcare services. Development of wireless sensor networking area has greatly increased the feasibility of a mobile e-health system since it provides wireless communication technology with promising sensor network applications. However, mobile e-health is subjected to a lot of security attacks such as sensor node cloning attack and man-in-the-middle attack. A secure e-health authentication system is one of the important approaches in order to provide high security for the whole e-health monitoring system. Considering the potential security attacks in mobile e-health application, a development of a unique identity of the e-health sensor node is proposed to provide a highly secure authentication protocol in mobile e-health. The identity of the e-health sensor node is a very important element in the proposed authentication protocol to ensure the confidentiality and the authenticity of transmitted e-health data.},

abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services towards 5G.},

The proposal is initially verified with the Siafu simulator in an AAL scenario where the users health is monitored with information about blood pressure and body temperature. The research proceeded with the use of IoT technology, the e-Health Sensor Platform, a differentiated real environment. The experiment used the sensors: pulse and oxygen in blood, body temperature, blood pressure, patients position and falls. Just as in the simulation, and with the QoC evaluation, the completed real experiment confirmed instances of insufficient QoC and its possible causes, in addition to alerts to potential health problems.

abstract={This letter proposes a novel privacy-aware “blind” cloud infrastructure to be utilized for storage, processing, and organization of health data. Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},

Governments encourage smart city initiatives to explore its applications. To determine knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare institutions toward IoT applications it is very important to objectively understand effects, to systematically summarize experiences, risks and barriers, to suggest market- oriented requirements, and to provide inspiration and reference for future smart city initiatives. Methods: We designed a KAP questionnaire about the IoT for healthcare and conducted a survey among municipal hospitals in Wuxi, China in May, 2015. Results: All respondents agreed on the definition of IoT for healthcare and easily obtained knowledge about the new IoT technology. Respondents showed positive views towards valuable functions and preferred solutions with inventory or material tracking, identification and authentication to make healthcare services more effective, convenient, and safe. We have stated that it is critical to solve security, privacy, and standardization issues. Last but not least, we have observed that governmental investments had played a guiding role and promoted IoT applications. Conclusions: The pilot survey has provided important insights into the KAP of IoT applications for healthcare institutions. In the near future, a KAP survey of IoT for healthcare in other cities in China and internationally will be conducted in order to gain further insights.},

abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multi-organ failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user’s infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user’s mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end to end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSN), to incorporating the internet of things (IoT), to communication links, to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise is of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and the future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level towards the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision - aking regarding their PHI/EHR. A lot of work and effort is necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/ pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},

abstract={Health issues are rising progressively due to the ignorance of health monitoring on regular basis which can now be looked after by the fast growing communication technologies and smart devices. In this paper, a robust healthcare model is proposed for continuous monitoring of the patient even when the patient is traveling. Sensitive data is collected from the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors connected to the patient's body and sent to the server through the smartphone of the patient. The mechanism under discussion in this paper ensures that if the patient's smartphone is malfunctioning then IoT sensors will connect to the optimal peer smartphone available in his vicinity and transmit data without interruption. The data received is then analyzed and reports are generated. In case of emergency, stakeholders are informed.},

abstract={Emergency medical services are largely to provide facility to people in need of medical treatment or to take patient to the point of definitive care. In developing countries such as Pakistan, emergency medical services, especially pre-hospital emergency case services, are neglected for quite a long time. In metropolitan cities, timely access to emergency care becomes challenging with the increasing number of population. The objective of this research is to propose an end-to-end communication solution in the form of an integrated platform consisting of applications that could facilitate patients and Rescue Service Providers in critical situations efficiently and effectively. An experimental research approach was adopted to develop integrated emergency response platform. A combination of mobile and web technologies was employed to develop proposed platform. Such platforms are helpful to decrease response time and assist rescue service providers by providing associated information such as shortest route to location of incident or nearest hospital which helps users in quick decision making.},

abstract={In this paper, the Quality of Service (QoS) for a concrete network based in the prospective idea of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is estimated. We use the well-known mathematical convolution for the segments of the network. This methodology is applied using the simple definition of efficiency per segment. The first segment assumes the communication between nanosensor and intra-body device, whereas in the second one the intra-body device is engaged to the bio-cyber interface through the THz band. Others segments belong to the macroscopic scale but working in the MHz band. When the full QoS is estimated and assuming the most optimistic scenario, our crude estimation for the concrete case applied to nanomedicine has turned out to to be of order of 85%. In the other side, the lowest values of QoS would yield numbers below 50% by which the network might be running in those scenarios where traffic in cloud might degrade the IoBNT substantially.},

abstract={Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is an innovative communication technique mainly used in biomedical applications for assisting devices. In this context, main aim is help people with severe disabilities restore the movement ability, or replace lost motor function controlling external devices, or communicate with other people leading them to become more self-sufficient. The connection between BCI and wireless communication standards brings BCI into the Internet of Things (IoT), giving the opportunity to better interconnect the brain of both able and disable people with the surrounding physical and cyber worlds: it is called the human in the loop paradigm. The combination of BCI and IoT falls within the wider topic of Cognitive IoT technology, an enriched solution for Industry 4.0 and IoT in industry. The integration of the human role in the IoT can lead to several advantages both in human life and in technological progress. As a novel measurement device, BCI has to be widely characterized in order to improve the reliability of the obtained result. In this work, the authors review the scientific challenges of electroencephalography data acquisition for BCI, the parameters influencing its variability, and the processing techniques for a correct feature extraction and data classification. In particular, first the influence factors and the issues of EEG acquisition are reviewed. Then, the most popular devices used for BCI sensing unit are described. Finally, the authors describe the post processing techniques, the feature extraction algorithms, and the the classifier to properly choose the right signal feature.},

abstract={Advances in the information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Thing(IoT). IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed - such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all. This paper is a review of Healthcare Monitoring system using IoT.},

It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration. Based on the type of data transmission; proactive or reactive, these devices will process and provide the data for the health monitoring company to take the correct action when patient's state of health moves outside normal range. Finally, the proposed model was simulated by using Packet tracer 7.},

abstract={This paper presents a non-invasive breath test to monitor the condition of diabetic patients. It is identified as an easier technique and quick diagnoses of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a preventable acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Common diabetic test on patients are done on urinary test and blood ketone test to monitor for diabetes condition. However, those methods are considers as invasive, inconvenient and expensive. Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors. This research is significant where patients can independently monitor their diabetic health and the IoT system can be alerted directly to medial officers in the hospitals.},

It is a problem which spans both the first world and the third world. To counter this problem, there is a growing number of apps for smart devices and wearable devices which encourage people to exercise. These apps and wearables, however, are often not focused on the poor, the aged, and the infirm who can not afford such devices.

abstract={High Energy Physics (HEP*) experiments around the globe are using sophisticated equipments to record unprecedented amounts of data to discover some of the deepest mysteries of nature. Efficient parallelized frameworks are needed to achieve the scalability and performance requirements of such scientific data analyses. To accelerate data processing capability, many of the HEP experiments globally are using a separate dedicated block to gather and organize the bulk amount of detector data before data processing. We present in this article an elementary prototype design of a configurable Data Aggregation Unit (DAU). DAU acts like a data traffic manager to handle data based on information content. It has three modes of operation, which allow the HEP experiments to optimize resource cost with data reliability. A detailed queuing model of the system is formulated, to help designers to prevent or predict data congestion and initiate data traffic diversion. A comparison has been drawn with the current existing architectures and also a roadmap showing how DAU helps future HEP readout architecture in smooth upgradation.},

abstract={Technology nowadays is growing very rapidly, so many systems have been digitized. Most of the digitization of this system leads to the development of web-based systems, it's also combined with embedded systems, to create a system called Web of Things. Besides, digitalization will be very useful if applied to the public service system, one of which is the queuing system. In this research, we are making and implementing Smart queue system to the medical centers. Our system is built by some software including PHP, CodeIgniter Framework with MySQL Database, MQTT, responsive design, and cloud-based storage. An IoT-based system is provided in medical centers, and it's synchronized with the web-based app, so it's possible to make a queue system that has two methods for reservation, it's online and offline method. This system can make the queue time more effective and efficient.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Smart grid (SG) is one of the most advanced technologies, which plays a key role in maintaining a balance between demand and supply by implementing demand response (DR) program. In SG, the main focus of the researchers is on home energy management (HEM) system, which is called demand side management (DSM). Appliance scheduling is an integral part of HEM system as it manages energy demand according to supply, by automatically controlling the appliances and shifting the load from peak to off peak hours. In this paper, the comparative performance of HEM controller embedded with heuristic algorithms; harmony search algorithm (HSA), enhanced differential evolution (EDE) and harmony search differential evolution (HSDE) is evaluated. The integration of renewable energy source (RES) in SG makes the performance of HEM system more efficient. The electricity consumption in peak hours usually creates peaks and increases the cost but integration of RES makes the electricity consumer able to use the appliances in the peak hours.We formulate our problem using multiple knapsack theory that the maximum capacity of the consumer of electricity must be in the range which is bearable for consumer with respect to electricity bill. Feasible regions are defined to validate the formulated problem. Finally, simulation of the proposed techniques is conducted in MATLAB to validate the performance of proposed scheduling algorithms in terms of cost, peak to average ratio and waiting time minimization.},

abstract={Objectives: Post hospitalization care of a patient treated for critical illness, for instance cardiac arrest has been regarded as imperative. Nevertheless, it has become inevitable to skip follow-ups by the patients themselves. Method: This paper aims at designing a system which continuously monitors the health of the patient despite the patient being busy with his routine. An application is developed on android platform combined with Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor devices. Health of patient will be monitored by sensors and data from sensors will be sent to cloud which can be accessed anytime by the doctor and/or caretaker both in the cloud and application for necessary follow-ups in real time. Findings: In order to find the health of a patient more parameters are needed. But the main parameter for identifying the health of a patient are heart rate and temperatures. More parameters can be added to the system developed. Improvements/Applications: More sensors can be added to the system and the system has many application scenarios such as family health care.},

abstract={PC4HC (Personalized Communication for Health Care) intends to create a communication platform tailored to people with multimorbidity and healthcare facilities that manage the care process. The project aims at: (1) Providing patients and healthcare facilities with a concise, clear and communicative interpretation of data from heterogeneous sources such as anamnestic, anthropometric, clinical and instrumental data (in particular, data obtainable from wearable sensors and so-called personal health systems). For this purpose, we plan to set up an infrastructure with high computational capabilities that is able to process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify new associations (Data Mining) between variables that can enrich communication and generate new knowledge. (2) Promoting a patient empowerment approach aimed at making the patient fully aware of the significance of a specific piece of information and the implications that it entails for the patient's state of health and wellbeing. To this end, we applied the principles of persuasive computing technology, i.e. technologies developed in order to influence and possibly modify habits and lifestyle choices through persuasion and awareness. (3) Implementing effective strategies to maintain health and a healthy lifestyle, as well as to provide integrated and optimized management of acute and chronic pathologies with an economic and social benefit for both individuals and the healthcare system.

abstract={In the last years, the emergence of pervasive connected devices and the development of the cloud computing paradigms brought a revolution in health-care and industrial applications. Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture.},

abstract={Recently, loT based healthcare systems have evolved as a tool to enhance the quality of life of people. This kind of system allows medical professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) to verify continuously the health conditions of their patients. As the healthcare systems manage highly sensitive physiological information of patients such as blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse, they are extremely vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care. In Gope-Hwang scheme, the authors proposed a lightweight anonymous authentication protocol and claimed that their scheme was secure. Unfortunately, this paper finds that Gope-Hwang scheme still has security pitfalls and limitations. This paper describes and cryptanalyzes the Gope-Hwang scheme to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security limitations. Then, it proposes an enhanced lightweight anonymous authentication scheme that solves the discovered security flaws. Additionally, this work executes security and performance analysis to demonstrate how the proposed protocol is more appropriate for a safe healthcare systems..},

abstract={The exponentially increasing number of IoT devices makes the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz) extremely crowded. Currently, there is no efficient solution to coordinate the large amount heterogeneous IoT devices that have different communication technologies (e.g., WiFi and ZigBee). To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce embedded multiple flows (EMF) communication method, which (i) embeds different pieces of information in existing traffic and (ii)concurrently sends out these information from one IoT sender to multiple IoT receivers that have a different communication technology from the sender. By doing this, our EMF method (i) enables cross-technology communication among heterogeneous IoT devices, (ii) does not introduce any extra control traffic, and (iii) is transparent to the higher layer applications. Our approach is implemented on USRPs and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ZigBee devices. We also conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our approach in real-world settings. The evaluation results show that EMF's throughput is more than 14 times higher than the latest cross-technology communication technique (i.e. FreeBee[1]).},

abstract={The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (loT) is quickly becoming the key enabler for the digital transformation of the healthcare industry by offering comprehensive improvements in patient engagements, productivity and risk mitigation. This paradigm shift, while bringing numerous benefits and new opportunities to healthcare organizations, has raised a lot of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.},

This research work provides a cost-worthy design of an embedded device for real time monitoring of newborn babies in the incubator. It permits early detection of potential life threatening events and maintains a safe environment for the infant. Many of the existing medical technological companies (such as small and medium) may not adopt the best existing technologies as its maintenance might not be cost effective. On the other hand the bigger medical firms which have adopted them are cost effective and common man cannot afford the same.

abstract={Modern wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices enable the monitoring of vital parameters such as heart or respiratory (RESP) rates, electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals within e-health applications. A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude. Finally, avenues for future research are discussed.},

abstract={Given the beneficial role of the serious games (SGs), which has been evaluated and found effective over the last years through large scale pilots, SGs are gradually being considered as new and effective tools in the healthcare domain. Following this evolution, this paper presents the potential value of the interplay between the Internet of Things and the SGs in a twofold approach: SGs consuming heterogeneous information coming from the user's environment (through IoT) as well as SGs as virtual devices providing meaningful information pertaining to the user's progress and physical and cognitive health status. The insights provided in this paper support the augmented personalization and consequently effectiveness of the SGs as part of the users' lifestyle. The paper concludes with the big challenge of the next years which will remain the deep understanding of the SGs information, as well as the semantic representation of it.},

abstract={Present day's IoT brings the gadgets together and assumes a fundamental part in different methodologies like smart home mechanization, savvy urban areas, vehicle parking, traffic control, brilliant industries, smart environment, agribusiness fields and patient health monitoring system and so on. One of the approaches is to monitor the health state of the patient and screen it to doctors or paramedical staff through the IoT, as it is hard to screen the patient for 24 hours. So here the patient health condition or status i.e. Pulse rate, Respiratory rate, Body Temperature, Position of the body, Blood glucose, ECG and so on can be measured by utilizing the Non-invasive sensors. These sensors are associated with the Arduino Uno board, it gathers the information i.e. biomedical data from the sensors and the detected biomedical information can be transmitted to the server. The “Thingspeak” named new cloud is utilized here to place the detected information into the server. From this server the information can be envisioned to the specialists and other paramedical staff by Thingspeak android app. In this way by utilizing this Smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of specialists and paramedical staffs to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore lessens the time and cost of support.},

abstract={With the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of IoT devices and sensors is increasing tremendously. This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility.},

abstract={Data intensive analysis is the major challenge in smart cities because of the ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of sensors. The natural characteristic of geodistribution requires a new computing paradigm to offer location-awareness and latency-sensitive monitoring and intelligent control. Fog Computing that extends the computing to the edge of network, fits this need. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical distributed Fog Computing architecture to support the integration of massive number of infrastructure components and services in future smart cities. To secure future communities, it is necessary to integrate intelligence in our Fog Computing architecture, e.g., to perform data representation and feature extraction, to identify anomalous and hazardous events, and to offer optimal responses and controls. We analyze case studies using a smart pipeline monitoring system based on fiber optic sensors and sequential learning algorithms to detect events threatening pipeline safety. A working prototype was constructed to experimentally evaluate event detection performance of the recognition of 12 distinct events. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the system's city-wide implementation in the future.},

abstract={Wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative, sometimes revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications that can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implantable and wearable devices. We show that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power and mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers the gap in attenuation between 2.4 GHz RF and ultrasonic waves is still substantial, e.g., ultrasounds offer 70 dB less attenuation over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires much lower transmission power compared to 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability in tissues, e.g., 35 dBm lower over 12 cm for 10-3 Bit Error Rate (BEr) leading to lower energy per bit and longer device lifetime. Finally, we show experimentally that 2.4 GHz RF links are not functional at all above 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10-6 up to 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.},

abstract={Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are electronic devices implanted within human body for diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.},

The concept of Internet of Things and connected healthcare will be put into context regarding improving the outcome of pregnancy for women with limited access to health care. Through our ongoing research project, we propose a system that can positively impact the standard of life for pregnant mothers. Modern day smartphones have proven to be extremely pervasive in developing regions of the world. Most of these smartphones are equipped with hardware that can support biometric monitoring of its user. By taking advantage of the sensors present on smartphones and an accessory biomedical signal acquisition device we intend to unobtrusively acquire vital information about the health status of pregnant women. The acquired data is then processed and classified using signal processing and analysis tools to assist healthcare practitioners evaluate the status of pregnant women remotely. Since most pregnant women in our area of focus already own smartphones, the cost associated with our system is minimal.

Radio over Fiber (RoF) combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a facilitating technique for high data rates and long-haul transmission. This paper demonstrates the simulation of 100 Gbps transmission on a single wavelength over a long haul - SMF link. Transmission performances of QAM, Coherent OFDM and Coherent DP OFDM schemes are compared in order to determine the maximum length of the transmission link for each of the scheme with and without dispersion compensation. For a typical rate of 10Gbps, Coherent DP OFDM with QAM scheme with/without dispersion compensation can provide transmission distances of 900 km and 9000km respectively. The Constellation diagrams also show an improvement of 20dB in the OSNR.},

abstract={Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},

abstract={We propose a preferential theme matrix for selecting a problem in carrying out the minor project for 6th semester Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. The matrix comprises of emerging technologies, research areas and the application domains as the parameters. It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data & analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external reco- nition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference.},

abstract={Older adults face challenges such as chronic health conditions, reduced mobility, and cognitive decline. Technological solutions are valuable resources to assist older adults in maintaining their quality of life. One approach involves the Internet of Things (IoT) connected sensors which are designed to detect and record individuals' activities and status within their living spaces. Despite the promise of these technologies to improve health outcomes and quality of life in older adults, there still remains a challenge in understanding older adults' perceptions and concerns. We propose to conduct a pilot study to demonstrate feasibility and understand older adults' preferences and needs using the IoT connected sensors within their home.},

abstract={Wearable devices for human activity tracking have been emerging rapidly. Most of them are capable of sending health statistics to smartphones, smartwatches or smart bands. However, they only provide the data for individual analysis and their data is not integrated into clinical practice. Leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT), edge and cloud computing technologies, we propose an architecture which is capable of providing cloud based clinical services using human activity data. Such services could supplement the shortage of staff in primary healthcare centers thereby reducing the burden on healthcare service providers. The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients. We provide a prototype based on our architecture and discuss its salient features. We also provide use cases of our system in personalized and home based healthcare services. We propose an International Telecommunication Union based standardization (ITU-T) for our design and discuss future directions in wearable IoT.},

pages={3269-3272},
abstract={Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has many important applications in bio-engineering while acquiring high dimensional spectroscopy is usually time consuming. Non-uniformly sampling can speed up the data acquisition but the missing data points have to be restored with proper signal models. In this work, a specific two dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance signal, in which the first dimension lies in frequency domain while the second dimension lies in time domain, is reconstructed with a proposed low rank Hankel-matrix method. This method explores two general properties: 1) the rank of a structured matrix, converted from a 2D exponential signal, is equal to the number of 2D spectral peaks; 2) this rank is small if the spectrum is sparse. Results on real magnetic resonance spectroscopy show that proposed method outperforms the state-of-compressed sensing method on recovering low-intensity spectral peaks.},

abstract={With the growth of aging population, elder care service has become an important part of the service industry of Internet of Things. Activity monitoring is one of the most important services in the field of the elderly care service. In this paper, we proposed a wearable solution to provide an activity monitoring service on elders for caregivers. The system uses wireless signals to estimate calorie burned by the walking and localization. In addition, it also uses wireless motion sensors to recognize physical activity, such as drinking and restroom activity. Overall, the system can be divided into four parts: wearable device, gateway, cloud server, and caregiver's android application. The algorithms we proposed for drinking activity are Decision Tree (J48) and Random Forest (RF). While for restroom activity, we proposed supervised Reduced Error Pruning (REP) Tree and Variable Order Hidden Markov Model (VOHMM). We developed a prototype service Android app to provide a life log for the recording of the activity sequence which would be useful for the caregiver to monitor elder activity and its calorie consumption.},

abstract={Personal health record (PHR) systems have yet to reach mass adoption despite years of varied implementations. In this paper, we examine the limitations of current PHRs and propose an interconnected PHR system built in adherence with healthcare data communication standards and an IoT Cloud platform. The new ecosystem includes: an interoperable hospital information system to store electronic medical records (EMRs) and transfer them to a PHR system via email; a public cloud that supports encrypted data sharing for big data analysis services; a PHR gateway repository based on an IoT module which communicates with hospitals and public clouds; and a mobile application to manage and view PHR. This system can store and share raw EMR and life log data based on the healthcare communication standard "HL7 FHIR". To validate the usability of the interconnected PHR system, a clinical trial is underway to develop an obesity management model from individuals' hospital-provided genomic data, on the one hand, and diet and exercise logs gathered by the mobile application, on the other. We demonstrate how the proposed IoT Cloud based PHR ecosystem is interoperable and practical for promoting healthcare big data analysis services.},

abstract={In many respects, farming and food processing have lagged other industries when it comes to adoption of innovative technology. Whilst bioengineering has brought about seeds with much higher yield and less need for water and nutrients, it is only now with IoT that farmers can work on the intensive use of natural resources to increase the sustainability of their operations. In the last ten years, high-end machinery has evolved primarily to the benefit of larger corporations, with the introduction of satellite driven machines, sensors and all components of precision farming. The most recent IoT advances bring about a level of simplification and cost reduction that enable all farmers to benefit and a true adoption of prescription agriculture. In this conference presentation, we will examine a practical case of a Malthouse, where careful modeling of how CO2, Temperature, Humidity and PH vary in the three steps of the malting process, enabled an artificial intelligence system to prescribe different setting and schedules. The end result is malt with higher content of starch and proteins, which in turn means higher alcohol in the downstream process. A second example on the cultivation of Medical Marijuana, where similarly but in a more complex fashion (138 variables) the artificial intelligence supported the tuning of many settings and schedules, is presented only in the conference.},

However, IoT will facilitate the rise of new applications, with automated healthcare monitoring platforms being amongst them. This paper presents the pillars of design for such applications, along with the evaluation of a working prototype that collects ECG traces from a tailor-made device and utilizes the patient's smartphone as a Fog gateway for securely sharing them to other authorized entities. This prototype will allow patients to share information to their physicians, monitor their health status independently and notify the authorities rapidly in emergency situations.

pages={1327-1337},
abstract={The computer-aided diagnosis for histopathological images has attracted considerable attention. Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.},

The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support integrated healthcare services in elderly homecare can make an important contribution to reducing such costs. The SOCIALIZE AAL project aims to create a new reference platform for the elderly by applying technological solutions to simplify their daily activities and the means by which they access dedicated services in order to improve their quality of life. This paper describes the Elderly Monitoring service - an IoT module of the SOCIALIZE platform, whose aim is to collect environmental and physical user data so that they can be supervised by medical and caregiver staffs. The system has been designed to enable easy addition and/or substitution of new services and devices within the environment. To this end, the service implements a framework that enables heterogeneous devices belonging to different domotic systems and protocols to directly share data, thereby implementing an infrastructure suitable for the fulfillment of a real Social IoT (SIoT).},

All the activities have been developed, investigated and evaluated within EU CHIST-ERA eGlasses project (http://www.eglasses.eu/). The technological platform of the eGlasses provides a software API to control all input / output devices and to support standardized wireless communication with other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The software libraries support data processing functions, including evaluation of heart rate from a video sequence, eye tracking in reference to the front camera images, and other AAL-related applications. It was shown that such measurements like ECG, EEG, EMG, and respiration waveform can also be measured using electrodes located on or near the frame of the smart glasses.},

The bolt is equipped with temperature sensor, an RF chip and it is powered by a Thermoelectric generator (TEG). The work includes the design choices on the small size TEG, and characterizations of the TEGs and DC-DC converters suitable for ensuring reliability and energy neutral conditions. The characterization was done to determine the amount of power that can be generated from a TEG under different loads and at temperature gradients typical of mechanical environments.

abstract={In recent years, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has largely been supported by the parallel development of the Cloud computing capacities. Cloud computing offered elastic and on-demand computing power able to host and support crucial IoT functions. However, the proliferation of connected objects poses the problem of the confidentiality of the data produced. This proliferation also threatens the performances of the supporting networks. To tackle those problems, the research community has recently turned to Fog Computing. In this paper, we present CIoud4IoT, a platform able to perform horizontal (roaming) and vertical (offloading) migration of IoT functions. We implement our demonstration using a Kubernetes cIuster organised in three tiers: Cloud, Edge and IoT gateways. Our first use cases shows how IoT function roaming can be used in the context of health care data exploitation. The second use case exploits the IoT offloading capacity of our platform to optimize the remote diagnostic of mechanical engines.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={IEEE802.15.6 is a radio interface standard for wireless connectivity of wearable and implantable sensors and actuators located inside or in close proximity to the human body i.e., Body Area Network (BAN). Medical applications impose stringent requirements on BAN Quality of Service (QoS), including reliability and on-time availability of the sensors data. However, interference from other co-located BANs or other nearby devices sharing the same spectrum may cause unacceptable QoS degradation. The impact of such degradations can be minimized by using adaptive schemes that intelligently adjust relevant parameters at the transmitting or receiving nodes of a BAN. This paper provides a framework for low complexity regret minimization based algorithms for Energy Detection Threshold (EDT) adaptation in the transmitter node of a BAN. The nodes are assumed to be using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol according to the IEEE 802.15.6 BAN standard. Our preliminary simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of our algorithm compared to using a fixed EDT, and thus warrant future efforts in the adaptive EDT optimization as a mechanism to maintain QoS in various interference scenarios.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly developing field and has the potential to significantly impact the healthcare industry. However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.},

With the convergence of new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (CC) many sectors are benefited. Our research has to do with Big Data Delivery over the IoT. Specifically, in our research we are trying to investigate new communication protocols, new security mechanisms, new efficient, faster, safer, and energy efficient solutions and algorithms for healthcare systems (hospital buildings, rooms, etc.). The aim of our research is to create and propose suitable algorithms for efficient transmission of health big data, for management issues, for the analysis of IoT data and for security solutions. Our current position is the experimentation with IoT devices, IoT health data, big data analytics, and healthcare systems. In this paper we present some of the challenges and the issues of Big Data. We also present work that has been done by other researchers. Finally, is presented an open source tool for experimentation, so that we can view the system in detail. Such a tool is the Cooja emulator which is part of the Contiki OS, and is presented also in this paper. As future work we manage to implement such a healthcare system, provide more efficient algorithms, and investigate new protocols for more efficient and secure transmissions of the sensitive health data. By these improvements we are going to provide better healthcare and faster diagnosis to everybody.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new loT-based health monitoring approach in which collected medical sensor data is sent to an analysis module via low-cost, low-power and secure communication links provided by a LoRaWAN network infrastructure. We mainly focus on monitoring blood pressure, glucose and temperature in rural areas where cellular network coverage is either absent or does not allow data transmission. The main objective is to reduce the burden of long trips for people living in these areas to visit healthcare facilities, while minimizing the communication cost. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the area covered by the LoRa network and the power consumption of our system. The results indicate that the average area covered is around 33 km2 when the LoRa Gateway is placed outdoor on a 12 meter altitude. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the power consumption of our monitoring system is at least ten times lower than other long range cellular solutions, such as GPRS/3G/4G.},

abstract={In-home IoT devices play a major role in healthcare systems as smart personal assistants. They usually come with a voice-enabled feature to add an extra level of usability and convenience to elderly, disabled people, and patients. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a myriad of devices and services that interact to build complex distributed applications. Interoperability and standardization are imperative for the realization of this vision. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications standards can be the middleware that glues together the IoT. However, standards are highly complex and require a large amount of interpretation, deployments are currently scarce, and performance evaluations simplistic or speculative. In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications. Moreover, we observe that latencies between a smartphone GW and cloud hosted services vary largely depending on the user mobility, and on the promotion delay of the used wireless network.},

Thus, it is important to inform the person about his unhealthy life style and even alarm him/her before any acute condition occurs. To detect the stress beforehand we have used heart beat rate as one of the parameters.

abstract={Digital world has produced efficiencies, new innovative products, and close customer relationships globally by the effective use of mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), social media, analytics and cloud technology to generate models for better decisions. Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.},

The interactive SPB, which features a particular device that contains embedded sensors in each compartment that not only transmits detected signals to website when users are taking their pills but also receives a remind message back to the LCD screen on SPB by displaying words and/or patterns, or speaking a voice. This study uses the Webduino module installed in SPB to achieve two-way messaging with remote relatives via internet of thing (IoT). The module first reads the sensing signal in the kit and uses WiFi to transmit the signal to WiFi Router, and then sends the medication information to a remote webpage or cell phone for monitoring (on LCD). Remote relatives can input care messages on the webpage or mobile phone to send a signal back to the WiFi Router and then to Webduino module. After receiving the signal, Webduino will send it to Arduino for text display and voice playback in the SPB. Therefore, the elderly staying in their home or nursing home institution can easily manage their medication via this application. The smart interactive pill box will be crucial for medical care management for elder persons of this aging population or in the future.},

abstract={With mobility as the dominant theme in the emerging fabric of IoE (Internet of Everything), a prolific demand for capacity is a natural consequence. Throughput, latency reduction, availability and reliability are elemental attributes of experientially attractive and robust mobile multimedia services. These elemental attributes drive the demand for spectrum. The use of E-UTRA (Enhanced-Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) technologies, specified under the LTE project, over the 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum, is being considered as a forward-looking approach for standardization to meet the growing capacity demands to support mobile multimedia services. The 5 GHz spectrum band also includes the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, which is utilized by the IEEE 802 family of technologies. LAA (license assisted access) refers to the use of LTE technologies over unlicensed spectrum, with assistance using a licensed radio frequency carrier. A significant challenge in the standardization of LAA for interoperability is the management of co-channel and adjacent channel interference, when both E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies share the same unlicensed spectrum. These challenges are compounded by the differences in the regulations across the three different global ITU (International Telecommunication Union) regions (Europe, Americas, and Asia.) This article will identify strategies and corresponding trade-offs to mitigate the coexistence challenges between the E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies, utilizing forward-looking and interoperable enablers. In conclusion, the article will delineate recommendations for a realization of CA (carrier aggregation) between licensed and unlicensed spectrum for downlink and uplink, to accomplish deployment-specific capacity enhancements.},

year={2017},

pages={1-15},
abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},

abstract={Due to advances in medicine, the societies have become aging, which leads to the problem of missing teeth. Missing teeth negatively affects not only external appearance but also personal dietary habits. Therefore, it has become an important issue in dentistry to solve the problem of missing teeth. In Taiwan, dental prostheses for missing teeth are produced by dental technicians in dental laboratories. The traditional production of dental prostheses is labor consuming. But the need for human power in dental laboratories will not be satisfied in the future due to low human birth rate. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease the need for human power in this area by strategies of Productivity 4.0. In this study, we plan to improve the managing efficiency of traditional dental prosthesis production in dental laboratories. Firstly the material of denture and environmental parameters of lab will be gathered by the framework of Internet of Things (IoT). Then data mining will be used to improve the efficiency of inventory management. In this case, the concept of Productivity 4.0 can be successfully applied to the production of dental prostheses.},

abstract={The spry maturation of Internet of Things (IoT) has paved way to the rapid development of numerous sectors and these have been envisioned in; connected transport, smart cities, connected homes, connected healthcare, etc. IoT is a technology that connects "things" that are embedded with sensors, actuators and network connectivity to collect and exchange the data to the internet. The ability of IoT that offers distinct technologies for a small constrained device to collect and deliver messages across sophisticated networks leaves room for more exploration. Zeroing down to the healthcare sector, a couple of Personal Health Devices (PHDs) have been developed to collect and share information across the internet. One Machine to Machine (oneM2M), ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD are some of the healthcare standards that have been developed have been developed to deal with the issue of interoperability in the IoT. In this paper we design and implement an interoperable messaging system that is based on international standards for IoT healthcare services. Standard IoT protocols; Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are some of the protocols that were designed to be used in an IoT environment. We designed and implemented a message system using CoAP following international standards for IoT healthcare services. This is due to better performance that CoAP offers in a constrained environment over other protocols. The paper further analyses and evaluates a comparative performance of number of packets transmitted in a transaction and packet loss rate number during transmission between the designed system and existing messaging system that uses MQTT.},

abstract={The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought new security requirements in terms of communication services with respect to data transmitted in mobile networks. Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks.

abstract={Recent years have witnessed tremendous advances in wearable technology with many applications ranging from health and fitness, sports, security, and more recently augmented reality. Classical body area networks have been reduced to small, wearable devices such as smart watches where signal acquisition is accompanied by processing or streaming to a more powerful device such as a smart phone (or “fog”), or directly to the Cloud. We present a system based around EPIC electric potential sensors which are capable of acquiring bio-electric signals, including an electrocardiogram-like signal (ECG). The paper compares a set of validation algorithms for the extraction of Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR) suitable for use on EPIC sensor data acquired with the proposed system. These algorithms are evaluated in terms of precision and the estimated robustness and variance. The system is of particular relevance in the field of Augmented and Virtual Reality, in which such a miniaturised, wireless platform becomes a necessity [1].},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been prevailing to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services. As connected IoT devices have enhanced smart home, connected smart homes are expected to grow into smart community. However, several previous studies about smart community require a remote central server and do not consider local collaboration based on local direct communication networks. This paper proposes home-to-home (H2H) communication based on wireless communication between homes in a local community. Several types of local collaborations are described. Two plausible H2H communication architectures are presented such as centralized and distributed. Two architectures are evaluated using two metrics: traffic volume and communication reliability. Clustering is also adopted to reduce traffic volume. The evaluation results show that the centralized architecture is superior in traffic volume and it is more adequate for all-to-all type of local collaboration such as information sharing; that the distributed architecture is superior in communication reliability and it is more adequate for one-to-all type of local collaboration such as safety and security. Clustering greatly reduces traffic volumes. Therefore, the proposed H2H communications will provide more efficient communication and more reliable services under the circumstances of IoT-enabled smart homes.},

abstract={During a disaster incident, existing network infrastructures might either be damaged or overloaded. However, disaster operations require real-time and low latency data communication, especially live video and audio streaming, as well as in integration with social networks. Thus, deployed tactical networks face several challenges to connect intervening teams. To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In our recent works, a new routing protocol called ORACE-Net was proposed, evaluated and compared to the existing approaches. ORACE-Net aims to create a tactical Internet of Humans (IoH) emergency network. ORACE-Net is implemented on mobile devices and evaluated within realistic conditions. The complete proposed solution consists of the CROW2, an Internet of Humans-based platform for disaster relief and emergency communication. In this paper we describe the setup and the demonstration of the CROW2 platform based on the our conducted experimentation.},

abstract={A better lifestyle starts with a healthy heart. Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers. In addition, the system can represent the collected data in useful ways, perform automatic decision making and provide many advanced services such as real-time notifications for immediate attention.},

abstract={Traditionally, distributed computing concentrates on computation understood at the level of information exchange and sets aside human and organizational concerns as largely to be handled in an ad hoc manner. Increasingly, however, distributed applications involve multiple loci of autonomy. Research in multiagent systems (MAS) addresses autonomy by drawing on concepts and techniques from artificial intelligence. However, MAS research generally lacks an adequate understanding of modern distributed computing. In this Blue Sky paper, we envision decentralized multiagent systems as a way to place decentralized intelligence in distributed computing, specifically, by supporting computation at the level of social meanings. We motivate our proposals for research in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has become a major thrust in distributed computing. From the IoT's representative applications, we abstract out the major challenges of relevance to decentralized intelligence. These include the heterogeneity of IoT components; asynchronous and delay-tolerant communication and decoupled enactment; and multiple stakeholders with subtle requirements for governance, incorporating resource usage, cooperation, and privacy. The IoT yields high-impact problems that require solutions that go beyond traditional ways of thinking. We conclude with highlights of some possible research directions in decentralized MAS, including programming models; interaction-oriented software engineering; and what we term enlightened governance.},

In the low energy form, we have narrowband IoT (NBIoT). It is preferred in healthcare sector due to its low energy requirements. There are several proposals for the implementation of NBIoT in the healthcare sector. NBIoT has been standardized and it has perfect compatibility with cellular platforms such as LTE. Therefore in the recent times, NBIoT is a good choice for healthcare related applications. However, the security measures and other system related challenges are the biggest threats for NBIoT. If these issues and challenges are handled properly it can be one of the most suitable and popular choices for the low power wide area implementations of healthcare.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that interconnects billions of devices, such as cameras, sensors, RFIDs, smart phones, wearable devices, ODBII dongles, etc. Federations of such IoT devices (or things) provides the information needed to solve many important problems that have been too difficult to harness before. Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure. An analysis of the experimental results that illustrate the unconstrained scalability of our technique concludes the paper.},

The ecosystem is based on the Cloud-Fog-Dew computing paradigm services, providing a full symbiosis by integrating the whole range from low level sensors up to high level services using integration efficiency inherent in synergistic use of applied technologies. Inside of this ecosystem, all of them are encapsulated in the following network layers: Dew, Fog, and Cloud computing layer. Instead of the “spaghetti connections”, “mosaic of buttons”, “puzzles of output data”, etc., the proposed ecosystem provides the strict division in the following dataflow channels: consumer interaction channel, machine interaction channel, and caregiver interaction channel. This concept allows to decrease the physical, cognitive, and mental load on elderly care stakeholders by decreasing the secondary human-to-human (H2H), human-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-human (M2H) interactions in favor of M2M interactions and distributed Dew Computing services environment.

abstract={With the wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and specifically e-Health applications, the nature of mobile applications, the increased traffic and the increasing number of connected devices are changing the requirements of wireless mobile networking. Addressing such foreseen increase in number of connected mobile devices, our work proposes a new trend of on-demand mobile small-cells with caching capabilities for e-Health applications. The solution targets delay-tolerant monitoring e-Health applications, with optional ultra-low latency communications for emergencies. The proposed networking architecture supports user mobile devices acting as small-cells with caching capabilities, for later transmission, when efficient high data rate communication conditions exist. The solution supports immediate high data-rate low-latency transmission for emergency situations. The proposed system enhances the performance of cellular networks, by saving on valuable scarce bandwidth and radio resources, while decreasing interference. Self-organizing networking is used for the further optimization of the network performance. The paper discusses performance gains resulting from mobile small cell deployment.},

abstract={Due to hectic life schedule, people usually tends to forget to take their medicine on time due to forgetfulness. In most rural parts of India most of the people are unable to follow the doctor's prescription, which causes over dosage or wrong dosage due to misunderstanding of doctor's direction. It may cause negative consequences for patients. Sometimes it results to severe impact on their health. This paper presents the design and implementation of “eMedicare” for those who take medications without continuous professional supervision. Electronic dispensing systems are eHealth drug storage devices that electronically dispense medications in a programmed fashion and track medication use. eMedicare acts as watchdog for medication usage. eMedicare can track the missed medications doses. It notifies the patients through beating an alarm, or through a phone call or updating data on the server. Live data is updated in the server for each dose at the scheduled time with help of Internet of Things (IoT)[3]. Sometimes even after the alarm, if the patients did not take any medicines then it will alert the care takers/ nursing staff through sending messages to server or making phone calls. Caretaker can access the details anywhere using mHealth.},

volume={5},

pages={10040-10051},
abstract={Applications of Internet of Things underwater wireless sensor networks, such as imaging underwater life, environmental monitoring, and supervising geological processes on the ocean floor, demand a prolonged network lifetime. However, these networks face many challenges, such as high path loss, limited available bandwidth, limited battery power, and high attenuation. For a longer network lifetime, both balanced and efficient energy consumption are equally important. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, called balanced energy adaptive routing (BEAR), to prolong the lifetime of UWSNs. The proposed BEAR protocol operates in three phases: 1) initialization phase; 2) tree construction phase; and 3) data transmission phase. In the initialization phase, all nodes share information related to their residual energy level and location. In the tree construction phase, our proposed BEAR exploits the location information for: a) selecting neighbour nodes and b) choosing the facilitating and successor nodes based on the value of cost function. In order to balance the energy consumption among the successor and the facilitator nodes, BEAR chooses nodes with relatively higher residual energy than the average residual energy of the network. The results of our extensive simulations show that BEAR outperforms its counterpart protocols in terms of network lifetime.},

abstract={Authentication and encryption within an embedded system environment using cameras, sensors, thermostats, autonomous vehicles, medical implants, RFID, etc. is becoming increasing important with ubiquitious wireless connectivity. Hardware-based authentication and encryption offer several advantages in these types of resource-constrained applications, including smaller footprints and lower energy consumption. Bitstring and key generation implemented with Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs can further reduce resource utilization for authentication and encryption operations and reduce overall system cost by eliminating on-chip non-volatile-memory (NVM). In this paper, we propose a dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) strategy for implementing both authentication and encryption using a PUF for bitstring and key generation on FPGAs as a means of optimizing the utilization of the limited area resources. We show that the time and energy penalties associated with DPR are small in modern SoC-based architectures, such as the Xilinx Zynq SoC, and therefore, the overall approach is very attractive for emerging resource-constrained IoT applications.},

We present the first review on fog computing within healthcare informatics, and explore, classify, and discuss different application use cases presented in the literature. For that, we categorize applications into use case classes and list an inventory of application-specific tasks that can be handled by fog computing. We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud. These findings substantiate the need for a coherent approach toward fog computing in healthcare, for which we present a list of recommended research and development actions.},

abstract={Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising technology for realizing energy-efficient wireless sensors for long-term health monitoring. However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel sparse common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm to optimally select channels of EEG signals. Compared to the traditional CSP, which maximizes the variance of signals in one class and minimizes the variance of signals in the other class, the classification accuracy is guaranteed by a constraint that the ratio of variances of signals in two different classes is lower bounded. Then, a sparse spatial filter is achieved by minimizing the l1-norm of filter coefficients and channels of EEG signals can be further optimized. The original nonconvex optimization problem is relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP), which can be efficiently solved by well-developed numerical solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can identify and discard about 50% channels with only 1% decrease of classification accuracy.},

abstract={According to a study done in 2014 by National Health Interview Survey around 6.3 million children in United States suffer from asthma [1]. Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth1, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using - n inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.},

In inventory applications, a known or unknown number of RFID tags are queried in a discrete manner and for a single, short period of time, until each tag is recognized by the interrogator device. Passive RFID provides several benefits conducive to ubiquitous deployment, including RFID tags that are energized from the wireless RF interrogation signal itself that obviates the need for a battery or wired power, and antenna assemblies that can be integrated with the chip with only a small footprint.We have utilized these benefits to enable continuous biomedical sensing devices with minimal footprint and batteryless deployment.These devices are fabric-based smart garments with an embedded RFID tag and antenna assembly. However, traditional inventory-based RFID interrogation presents several challenges due to the RFID protocols and regulations that govern their use. In this paper, we discuss the considerations necessary to utilize RFID interrogation to enabling passive, continuous sensor monitoring, and the techniques we employed in developing software to do so.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel signal quality-aware Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry system for continuous cardiac health monitoring applications. The proposed quality-aware ECG monitoring system consists of three modules: 1) ECG signal sensing module; 2) automated signal quality assessment (SQA) module; and 3) signal-quality aware (SQAw) ECG analysis and transmission module. The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches. This paper further shows that the transmission of acceptable quality of ECG signals can significantly improve the battery lifetime of IoT-enabled devices. The proposed quality-aware IoT paradigm has great potential for assessing clinical acceptability of ECG signals in improvement of accuracy and reliability of unsupervised diagnosis system.},

volume={4},

pages={705-712},
abstract={Dietary monitoring can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis, body weight control, and dietary habit management, and thus it is welcomed by patients, dieters, and nutritionists. While various techniques have been used for dietary monitoring in clinical trials and user studies, they are not ready for daily use. Existing solutions either require tedious manual recording or may impede normal daily activities. In this paper, a pair of diet-aware glasses is designed. The key idea here is that when people wear glasses, the temples of the glasses are in touch with the lower part of the temporalis muscle, one of the mastication muscles. By integrating an electromyography (EMG) sensor into glasses, the glasses can measure the muscle activity of the temporalis to detect intake-related events. This paper instantiates the idea by building a prototype equipped with an EMG sensor, a microcontroller, SD shield/card and a Bluetooth radio. When working together with a smartphone, the glasses can provide detailed information on intake schedule, the number of chewing cycles and broad food category.

abstract={A device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network is pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications, since it is expected to bring the significant benefits of improving user throughput, extending the battery life of mobiles, etc. However, D2D and cellular communications in the same network may cause cross-tier interference (CTI) to each other. Also a critical issue of using D2D assisted cellular networks under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical equipments. In consideration of CTI and EMI, we study the problem of optimizing individual channel rates of the mobile users in different priorities (different levels of emergency) within the Internet of Vehicles for mobile health, and propose an algorithm of controlling the transmit power to solve the above-mentioned problem under a game-theoretical framework. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can converge linearly to the optimum, while ensuring an allowable level of EMI on medical equipments.},

abstract={With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose a- innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting. The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.},

abstract={This paper reports early developments on an wearable IoT system that can be used for collecting quantified data about interactions among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in classroom settings. The overall objective of the project is to perform data-driven detection, therapy, intervention, and progress monitoring for children with Autism. Early intervention can help support the development of social skills for children with ASD. To perform intervention, teachers monitor the social interaction progress of children with ASD through observational methods, which can often be lengthy and subjective, therefore requiring extensive teacher training to ensure accuracy. Although new technologies have begun to emerge, no existing technologies can provide quantitative and automatically-collected data about peer interactions for children with ASD. We address this critical need through a wearable sensor system that can provide real-time quantitative data about peer interactions in classroom settings. The long-term objective of the project is to use this system for data-driven detection, therapy, intervention, and progress monitoring for children with Autism.},

pages={79-90},
abstract={Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internetof-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. These algorithms, however, need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as addition/ removal of a sensor to/ from the network or displacement/ misplacement/ mis-orientation of the physical sensors on the body. We challenge this retraining model by stimulating the vision of autonomous learning with the goal of eliminating the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly expensive process of collecting labeled training data in dynamic environments. We propose an approach for autonomous retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any new labeled training data. We focus on a dynamic setting where new sensors are added to the system and worn on various body locations. We capture the inherent correlation between observations made by a static sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new dynamic sensor views for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our realtime dynamic-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an average accuracy of 81.1% in activity recognition using three experimental datasets. This amount of accuracy represents more than 13.8% improvement in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the sensor data in the newly added sensor. This performance is only 11.2% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.},

abstract={Given the popularity of smart environment in a hospital involving the participation of a large group of patients, scheduling of patients towards their desired destination is still being a challenging issue. With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), smart environments are increasingly being deployed in various public scenarios and in particular, hospitals are an important target environment for smart environments. This paper models a dynamic scheduling policy based on a patient flow scenario in order to solve the queuing issue and facilitate people's experience. The dynamic scheduling policy aims to forward incoming patients to dissolve jams especially at the peaks by giving accurate predication of appointment time. The main modelling technique is a formal method Performance evaluation process algebra (PEPA). The findings show that the dynamic scheduling policy is able to efficiently improve the patient flow.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has connected an incredible diversity of devices in novel ways, which has enabled exciting new services and opportunities. Unfortunately, IoT systems also present several important challenges to developers. This paper proposes a vision for how we may build IoT systems in the future by reconceiving IoT's fundamental unit of construction not as a "thing", but rather as a widely and finely distributed "microservice" already familiar to web service engineering circles. Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles. Our hope is that the vision of a microservices approach will help focus research that can fill in current gaps preventing more effective, interoperable, and secure IoT services and solutions in a wide variety of contexts.},

This paper proposes a decentralized ontology based system architecture that caters to a healthcare organization's privacy needs as well as its enterprise security policy concerns considering futuristic IoT and Electronic Health Records (EHR) trends in healthcare. To identify privacy infringements and organizational policy violations across the institution, our proposed HealthCare Security and Privacy (HCSP) ontology is utilized in conjunction with three agent-level filters: the Exception Creation Agent (ECA), the Policy Mapping Agent (PMA), and the Privacy Assurance Filter (PAF).

The subprojects of platform are: a) wheelchair with automatic elevation; b) lift system for sustain patients during movements and daily activities; and c) physical therapy assistant with variable load. Each subproject has local control systems. This work presents an integrated supervisory system with three layers to control RPAT based on Internet of Things. A first simplified prototype was assembled with a simple Arduino controller to analyze the compatibility between software implemented in C# and SQL. The language was chosen to promote usability and database storage robustness. Parameters like response and usability were evaluated and results were considered satisfactory in terms of compatibility between the local control and the supervisory control. Internet of Things in parallel with Assistive Technologies can promote greater independence for people with disabilities and improve long-term therapies results inside the hospital. The proposed control architecture also allows big data analysis, a potential source for clinical discoveries in future.},

abstract={Multi-scale-based image fusion is one of main fusion methods, in which multi-scale decomposition tool and feature extraction play very important roles. The quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) is one of the effective multi-scale decomposition tools. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multimodal image fusion method using QWT and multiple features. First, we perform QWT on each source image to obtain low-frequency coefficients and high-frequency coefficients. Second, a weighted average fusion rule based on the phase and magnitude of low-frequency subband and spatial variance is proposed to fuse the low-frequency subbands. Next, a choose-max fusion rule based on the contrast and energy of coefficient is proposed to integrate the high-frequency subbands. Finally, the final fused image is constructed by inverse QWT. The proposed method is conducted on multi-focus images, medical images, infrared-visible images, and remote sensing images, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Due to its abilities to capture real-time data concerning the physical world, the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon is fast gaining momentum in different applicative domains. Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},

abstract={Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are committed to bring the industry automation into the era of Industry 4.0 by providing the ubiquitous perception to improve the production efficiency. However, the proliferation of wireless devices in industrial applications makes the spectrum sharing in limited industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band a challenging problem. In this paper, it is concerned with the intrinsic impact of the evenness of spectrum usage on the spectrum sharing performance in terms of channel accessing probability, spectrum utilization, and fairness of spectrum usage. In order to explore the explicit relationship between the evenness and spectrum sharing performance, a new concept of equilibrium is first defined to represent the achievable best evenness of spectrum usage. Then, a set of rules called local equilibrium-guided autonomous channel switching (LEQ-AutoCS) is devised, with which each accessed sensor autonomously equalizes the local channel occupations within its range of spectrum sensing without overhead on exchanging the sensors' spectrum sensing reports. It is further proved that the equilibrium can be achieved by this concessive manner. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LEQ-AutoCS rules provide higher utilization and fairness of spectrum usage comparing to the existing spectrum access approaches. Moreover, it is shown that LEQ-AutoCS rules assist the system to reduce the spectrum access delay to 1/2 of CSMA-based systems and 1/50 of TDMA-based systems, respectively.},

pages={2372-2385},
abstract={Clustering of big data has received much attention recently. In this paper, we present a new clusiVAT algorithm and compare it with four other popular data clustering algorithms. Three of the four comparison methods are based on the well known, classical batch k-means model. Specifically, we use k-means, single pass k-means, online k-means, and clustering using representatives (CURE) for numerical comparisons. clusiVAT is based on sampling the data, imaging the reordered distance matrix to estimate the number of clusters in the data visually, clustering the samples using a relative of single linkage (SL), and then noniteratively extending the labels to the rest of the data-set using the nearest prototype rule. Previous work has established that clusiVAT produces true SL clusters in compact-separated data. We have performed experiments to show that k-means and its modified algorithms suffer from initialization issues that cause many failures. On the other hand, clusiVAT needs no initialization, and almost always finds partitions that accurately match ground truth labels in labeled data.

abstract={A quiet revolution that impacts several sectors, ranging over transport, home automation, energy, industrial control, and health services is undergoing with addition of new networked devices leading to enhanced services. In this paper, we aim to identify information security requirements that are common over several (vertical) sectors, and in particular, ones that impact critical societal services, namely, the energy, water, and health management systems. We present the results of an interview-based study where actors in these sectors were asked about their perceptions and attitudes on the security of Internet of Things (IoT). We set these perceptions and attitudes in context through a literature review of IoT security, and relate to current challenges in this area. This paper demonstrates that despite an overall optimistic view on IoT in critical societal services, there is a lack of consensus on risks related to IoT security.},

In particular, we propose a methodology that supports and makes the transferring possible. Based on a collaborative training strategy, classifier ensembles of randomized trees are used to create activity recognition models that can successfully be transferred within the nodes of the network. The methodology has been applied in scenarios where a node present in the network is replaced by a new node located in the same position (replacement scenario) and relocated to a previously unknown position (relocation scenario). Experimental results show that the transferred recognition models achieve high-recognition performance in the replacement scenario and good-recognition performance are achieved in the relocation scenario.

year={2015},
volume={2},
number={1},
pages={14-22},
abstract={Multipath routing in wireless multimedia sensor network makes it possible to transfer data simultaneously so as to reduce delay and congestion and it is worth researching. However, the current multipath routing strategy may cause problem that the node energy near sink becomes obviously higher than other nodes which makes the network invalid and dead. It also has serious impact on the performance of wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). In this paper, we propose a pair-wise directional geographical routing (PWDGR) strategy to solve the energy bottleneck problem. First, the source node can send the data to the pair-wise node around the sink node in accordance with certain algorithm and then it will send the data to the sink node. These pair-wise nodes are equally selected in 360° scope around sink according to a certain algorithm. Therefore, it can effectively relieve the serious energy burden around Sink and also make a balance between energy consumption and end-to-end delay. Theoretical analysis and a lot of simulation experiments on PWDGR have been done and the results indicate that PWDGR is superior to the proposed strategies of the similar strategies both in the view of the theory and the results of those simulation experiments. With respect to the strategies of the same kind, PWDGR is able to prolong 70% network life. The delay time is also measured and it is only increased by 8.1% compared with the similar strategies.},

abstract={With newly developed wireless neuroheadsets, electroencephalography (EEG) neurometrics can be incorporated into in situ and ubiquitous physiological monitoring for human mental health. As a resource constraint system providing critical health services, the EEG headset design must consider both high application fidelity and energy efficiency. However, through empirical studies with an off-the-shelf Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset, we uncover a mismatch between lossy EEG sensor communication and high neurometric application fidelity requirements. To tackle this problem, we study how to learn the sensitivity of neurometric application fidelity to EEG data. The learned sensitivity is used to develop two algorithms: 1) an energy minimization algorithm minimizing the energy usage in EEG sampling and networking while meeting applications' fidelity requirements and 2) a fidelity maximization algorithm maximizing the sum of all applications' fidelities through the incorporation and optimal utilization of a limited data buffer. The effectiveness of our proposed solutions is validated through trace-driven experiments.},

year={2016},

number={1},
pages={27-37},
abstract={Intrabody nanonetworks for nervous system monitoring are envisioned as a key application of the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) paradigm, with the aim of developing radically new medical diagnosis and treatment techniques. Indeed, very recently, bionic devices have been implanted inside a living human brain as innovative treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. In this context, this paper proposes a systems-theoretic communication model to capture the actual behavior of biological neurons. Specifically, biological neurons exhibit physical extension due to their projections called dendrites, which propagate the electrochemical stimulation received via synapses to the soma. Experimental evidences show that the dendrites exhibit two main features: 1) the compartmentalization at the level of the dendritic branches of the neuronal processes and 2) the location-dependent preference for different frequencies. Stemming from these experimental evidences, we propose to model the dendritic tree as a spatiotemporal filter bank, where each filter models the behavior in both space and time of a dendritic branch. Each filter is fully characterized along with the overall neuronal response. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on the incoming stimulus for inducing a null-neuronal response are derived. The conducted theoretical analysis shows that: 1) the neuronal information is encoded in the stimulus temporal pattern, i.e., it is possible to select the neuron to affect by changing the stimulus frequency content; in this sense, the communication among neurons is frequency-selective and 2) the spatial distribution of the dendrites affects the neuronal response; in this sense, the communication among neurons is spatial-selective. The theoretical analysis is validated through a real neuron morphology.},

pages={3076-3086},
abstract={The intelligent wearable heart rate measurement requirement has attracted more and more attention, and the related applications of Internet of Things are emerging. However, under intensive physical exercises, motion artifacts are strong interference sources for wrist-type photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor signals, thus significantly affecting the accurate estimation of heart rate and other physiological parameters. Currently, how to effectively remove the motion artifacts from PPG sensor signals is becoming an active and challenging research realm. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel spectral matrix decomposition (MC-SMD) model to accurately estimate heart rate in the presence of intensive physical activities. Motivated by the observation that the PPG signal spectrum and the acceleration spectrum have almost the same spectral peak positions in the frequency domain, we first model the removal of motion artifacts as a spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem. After removing motion artifacts, we propose a new spectral peak tracking method for estimating heart rate. Experimental results on the well-known PPG data sets recorded from 12 subjects during intensive movements demonstrate that MC-SMD can efficiently remove the motion artifacts and retrieve an accurate heart rate using multi-channel PPG sensor signals.},

abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},

abstract={Motion analysis technologies have been widely used to monitor the potential for injury and enhance athlete performance. However, most of these technologies are expensive, can only be used in laboratory environments, and examine only a few trials of each movement action. In this paper, we present a novel ambulatory motion analysis framework using wearable inertial sensors to accurately assess all of an athlete's activities in real training environment. We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.},

abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},

year={2015},

pages={52-62},
abstract={Recently, most wireless network security schemes merely based on physical layer characteristics tackle the two fundamental issues-device authentication and secret key extraction separately. It remains an open problem to simultaneously achieve device authentication and fast secret key extraction merely using wireless physical layer characteristics, without the help of advanced hardware or out-of-band channel. In this paper, we answer this open problem in the setting of wireless body area networks (BANs). We propose MASK-BAN, a lightweight fast authenticated secret key extraction scheme for intra-BAN communication. Our scheme neither introduces advanced hardware nor relies on out-of-band channels. To perform device authentication and fast secret key extraction at the same time, we exploit the heterogeneous channel characteristics among the collection of on-body channels during body motion. On one hand, MASK-BAN achieves authentication through multihop stable channels, which greatly reduces the false positive rate as compared to existing work. On the other hand, based on dynamic channels, key extraction between two on-body devices with multihop relay nodes is modeled as a max-flow problem, and a novel collaborative secret key generation algorithm is introduced to maximize the key generation rate. Extensive real-world experiments on low-end commercial-off-the-shelf sensor devices validate MASK-BAN's great authentication capability and high-secret key generation rate.},

abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where WSNs will play an important role in future internet by several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},

The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel data compression and transmission scheme for power reduction in Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled wireless sensors. In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.},

abstract={A hierarchical key assignment scheme is a method to assign some private information and encryption keys to a set of classes in a partially ordered hierarchy, in such a way that the private information of a higher class can be used to derive the keys of all classes lower down in the hierarchy. Sometimes, it is necessary to make dynamic updates to the hierarchy, in order to implement an access control policy which evolves with time. All security models for hierarchical key assignment schemes have been designed to cope with static hierarchies and do not consider the issue of performing dynamic updates to the hierarchy. In this paper, we define the concept of hierarchical key assignment schemes supporting dynamic updates, formalizing the relative security model. In particular, we provide the notion of security with respect to key indistinguishability, by considering the dynamic changes to the hierarchy. Moreover, we show how to construct a hierarchical key assignment scheme supporting dynamic updates, by using as a building block a symmetric encryption scheme. The proposed construction is provably secure with respect to key indistinguishability, and provides efficient key derivation and updating procedures, while requiring each user to store only a single private key.},

pages={3702-3717},
abstract={Signals are generally modeled as a superposition of exponential functions in spectroscopy of chemistry, biology, and medical imaging. For fast data acquisition or other inevitable reasons, however, only a small amount of samples may be acquired, and thus, how to recover the full signal becomes an active research topic, but existing approaches cannot efficiently recover N-dimensional exponential signals with N ≥ 3. In this paper, we study the problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly N ≥ 3) exponential signals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor structure and the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of Hankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonance spectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover full signals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.},

abstract={Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency nowadays. Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.},

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks comprise tiny devices with limited processing power and tight energy restrictions. These limitations make it difficult to use established security mechanisms protecting the devices against malicious attacks. This holds particularly for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that help to detect various net-based attacks but often demand significant network and computing resources. In this article, we design and evaluate some IDS mechanisms for IoT Networks that are suited to small devices. They use a trust management mechanism that allows devices to manage reputation information about their neighbors. This mechanism makes it possible to single out maliciously behaving units in a processing and energy-friendly way. The approach is explained in the context of the healthcare domain.},

abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},

abstract={The pervasive computing discipline has evolved substantially since its inception. A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues. I will present use cases, highlight the challenges, describe our approaches, and relate to client expe- iences.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidlly in various sectors including health sector. There are many technologies used for IoT such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE-Advanced. IoT for health sector in Indonesia is used to improve health services based on telemedicine services roadmap by Indonesian Ministry of Health. This services include teleECG, teleRadiology and teleUSG which utilize mobile technology. In Indonesia, there is a tendency that IoT will be implemented on a large scale. Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to experience deficiency of 500 MHz mobile spectrum in 2020. Therefore, the calculation of spectrum for telemedicine services is urgently needed. This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia. The government of Indonesia should prepare about strategic spectrum management to anticipate the massive growing of IoT application, such as a roadmap of IoT development and a regulation of specific frequency in the nearest future.},

abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).},

From monitoring of disease to the treatment of illnesses is realized to be much more effective than ever before. The ability to exchange, connect and share information about human anatomy via non-invasive methods of radiology, nuclear medicine has opened up an entire new genre of medicine. Having said that, 'image distribution' in medical field has always been a challenge for the reasons known. And one primary parameter which always questions the very aspect of distribution has been 'Data Security and Patient Privacy'.The advances in technology and BYOD(Bring Your Own Devices) nature in the IOT industry has changed the paradigm of healthcare industry. In today's connected world it becomes increasing imperative to address aspects like 'data security, threat and patient privacy' and the 'risk mitigation' strategy within our products and solutions we offer. 'Prevention is better than cure' and history is the witness that no legislation has succeeded in totally eliminating security breaches from the globe. The only possible step is to adopt tight security implementation mechanisms and effective risk control measures in parallel to enhancing the privacy policies to combat the security attacks. In this paper we will see certain healthcare security lapses and what it means to stakeholders in the healthcare industry and an attempt to discuss few proven operational strategies, risk management methodologies and discern what the industry can do mitigate such security risks and privacy threats.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={99-104},
abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},

The respiratory rate monitor is one of the important vital signs which is useful for patient's who admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The respiratory rate is calculated by using LM35 temperature sensor and monitored the patient's respiration continuously based on voltage value of inhaled and exhaled air. NRF24l01 is used to transmit the sensor data from home to medical center. Then the data are published in a webserver using Ethernet to know the patient's status which is useful for doctor. And also the data is displayed in a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Once the threshold is reached, the alarm is generated and also a message generated in a webpage. Thereby doctor or medical professionals know the patient's conditions without delay. By using data mining techniques, people may know their condition without medical professionals help.},

abstract={Health and medical care are considered as one of the most fascinating applications that can fully benefit from the IoT deployment. In this work, we built a prototype of the Internet of Medical Things (IMedT) for monitoring cardiac activity in the form of phonocardiograph (PCG) signal. The prototype comprises of an agent and a manager. An agent runs a special task to collect heart sound signals and conditioning the signals. A manager, on the other hand, performs some tasks including: (i) gathering signal from some an agent or sensor node, (ii) operated as a web server to make the data available online locally and globally for doctors in order that the data can be accessed anywhere with certain authorization schemes, (iii) it is equipped with ability to do data mirroring to a data center in the cloud system in such a way that the most updated file can be copied to the targeted location to ensure the authorized healthcare providers and doctors anywhere around the globe to get the latest heart sound data for cardiac monitoring and diagnosing. Some issues regarding future development of the IMedT system were presented including smart diagnosis capability, security issues, and extension to the 6LoPAN as well as its compliance to the emerging 5G mobile networks.},

abstract={The state-of-the-art electronics technology has been an integral part of modern advances. The prevalent rise of the mobile device and computational technology in the age of information technology offers exciting applications that are attributed to sophisticated, enormously reliable, and most mature CMOS-based electronics. We are accustomed to high performance, cost-effective, multifunctional, and energy-efficient scaled electronics. However, they are rigid, bulky, and brittle. The convolution of flexibility and stretchability in electronics for emerging Internet of Everything application can unleash smart application horizon in unexplored areas, such as robotics, healthcare, smart cities, transport, and entertainment systems. While flexible and stretchable device themes are being remarkably chased, the realization of the fully compliant electronic system is unaddressed. Integration of data processing, storage, communication, and energy management devices complements a compliant system. Here, a comprehensive review is presented on necessity and design criteria for freeform (physically flexible and stretchable) compliant high-performance CMOS electronic systems.},

abstract={Physical indicators are directly related with health and fitness of human body. By employing real-time e-health monitoring systems for acquiring, and analyzing bio-signals by measurements such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), it is possible to extract information to achieve better health-care in terms of observation, diagnosis, and treatment. However, those systems are limited in acquiring and sending data at high rates, are not energy efficient, or, are restricted in terms of portability due to large size and weight. In this paper, a compact portable bio-signal acquisition device for wearables has been designed and implemented. The developed hardware is capable of acquiring and reliably sending the data wirelessly at a high transfer rate in real-time while keeping the overall energy consumption low. Finally, the signal acquisition performance of the device has been evaluated for both ECG and EMG at 8 channel 24 bit resolution/channel 500 samples/s configuration. Measurement of energy consumption has been conducted using professional tool and it is found that the device can continuously work for up to 13.6 hours with a 3.7V 1700 mAh battery. In addition, the device has been used in an IoT-based system as an example of possible integration.},

abstract={New prospects for health care monitoring is engendered by the augmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big data, as well as the ubiquitous nature of tiny wearable bio sensors. Many confront have yet to be addressed to create a dependable and flexible system for health care monitoring. In this paper Big data analytics on IoT based Health care system is proposed. IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework. Since the response time of the proposed system is less, it is suitable for real time alerting.},

Real time monitoring for analyzing vital signs to early detect or predict life threatening adverse events and frequent checks if the prescribed medicine is taken in time or not is required. In the existing system there is a need of another person for monitoring the patient condition. The proposed system eliminates the need of such manual observation of the patient. This system mainly consists of three components iMed box, iMed pack, Bio_patch which plays an important role. The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position. GSM is used to send and receive the information from the Doctor. Implementaton of this system will monitor the patient condition regularly and thus reduces sudden deaths.},

Most IoT devices today, from medical devices to connected vehicles and even smart buildings, come bundled with the capability of communicating wirelessly with one another. Consumers are progressively embracing the concept of connected devices while recent studies indicate that security is not high on the priority list of manufacturers especially in the way these devices route and communicate data amongst themselves thus, leaving the door wide open to attacks and compromises. We propose a trust-based RPL routing protocol, which addresses the blackhole attacks. We show that our proposed system is both secure from blackhole attacks while not imposing undue overheads on network traffic.},

abstract={Human action recognition plays an important role in E-health, such as risk assessment, disease treatment, rehabilitation and so on. We proposes a mobile phone-based internet of things method for human action recognition. In the work, data are collected from a smart phone worn on the waist and transmitted to the application server on the internet. The application server program cuts these data into segments of 128 samples with 50% overlap. And each segment is embedded into a 6-dimensional pseudo phase space, then a geometric template matching algorithm is applied to classify them into different actions. Last, Bayesian principle and voting rule are combined to confuse the results of the k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Experimental results on UCI HAR datasets show that this method can obtain a significant improvement in accuracy compared with the traditional SVM methods.},

abstract={The advancement of new technologies provides not only better understanding of health but also ways to encourage it. For example, IoT in health domain comes a long way than just helping individuals regulate their body. It has enabled many social functions that connect users to serve more health related purposes. However, in Indonesia, as such an idea is still novel, there is a need to examine how is it being represented in health context to increase health capabilities. We asked 241 college students across Greater Jakarta (17-25 years old; Mean of age = 20.47 years old; Standard deviation of age = 1.469 years; 83 males, 158 females) 10 questions to measure their Social Representation towards IoT in the health domain. This is a descriptive research, and the instrument for data collecting is a questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed using Voyant tool to generate words cirrus for every answer. The result showed that although participants generally perceive that IoT in health domain is potentially beneficial and can be used to increase health capabilities, there are a few practical agency freedom limitations, such as individual dispositions and economic status.},

Using this novel approach various factors like attention, stress, breathing index can be judged efficiently. To make it a complete e-health device, EOG (Electrooculography) sensor is introduced to it, to monitor the ocular movement of the eye and also to make it an autonomous device. The sole purpose of this system is to correctly detect and categorize the type of brainwaves and the eye movements, and then feed the input to the application side. The system consists of two parts: a) the hardware and b) digital signal processing module. The software part consists of the LabVIEW graphical program to monitor the components of brain waves.

abstract={Transforming the non-structured medical text data into structured data is the basis of the processing and analysis of medical data. The effect of general-purpose word segmentation tools recognizing terminology is not ideal, which greatly affects the accuracy of the word segmentation, and further influences the result of text structuralization. In view of above problems, this paper puts forward a method of discovering new words based on word embedding. It uses Google open source word vector tool word2vec to train text and map the words into abstracted n-dimensional vector space. We can get the latent semantic relations between words and words in the corpus. And then combining the information entropy and word frequency, we can find new words. Finally, we design information extraction rules to get the key information according to the new words, and organize them into structured data. Experimental results on real medical data show that the accuracy is improved by 10% compared to traditional method, and the time is saved by 18% compared to traditional method.},

abstract={In order to solve the problem of PCNN with improper parameter selection and determination of circulation iterations which leads to the image owe-segmentation or over-segmentation, an Iterative Self-organizing Data Clustering (ISODC) model is used in this paper to resolve the problems of the PCNN parameters selection and requiring multiple circulation. By using ISODC clustering search decision-making ability, the best threshold value is obtained. ISODC can solve the dilemma that PCNN needs to determine appropriate model parameters and circulation iterations. ISODC-PCNN makes use of the grey level of the image to cluster, and then uses the improved ISODATA to determine the initial number and the center of clustering which can be used as the optimal threshold value of PCNN. Therefore ISODC-PCNN can automatically segment an image with one time of iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the segmentation speed and achieves good segmentation results.},

abstract={With the more and more serious population aging problem, the demand of long-term care is increasing. Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly. Our real prototyping experience and some experimental results are also reported.},

abstract={Segmenting an image plays a crucial role in digital image processing. Segmentation depicts how the object is composed in an image and aids in extracting useful information from it so that interpretation becomes easier. Segmentation may be regarded as an essential pre-processing stage that will help to acquire objects that can be efficiently utilized in further steps of processing. This extraction of objects is helpful in almost every field today such as medical, forensic, industry and agriculture. Instead of using pixels, DWT make use of waves that helps to extract object efficiently. To raise the segmentation accuracy further an improved Fuzzy-C Mean with Edge and Local Information (FELICM) based gray stretch strategy is suggested that will help to segment an image by obtaining an optimistic and adaptive threshold by incorporating FELICM and gray stretch on coefficients with low frequency and edge enhancement on coefficients with high frequency after DWT. Existing and the proposed strategies have been compared using parameters Accuracy, Uniformity, Shape measurement and Regional Contrast.},

abstract={In recent years, image processing had covered a wide area over medical applications in diagnosis of wide variety of diseases in medical images. Brain tumor detection is one of the most widely used applications by vast researchers. In this paper a novel approach is presented for detection of affected mass (tumor) in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two level wavelet transform is used to decompose the brain image with mother wavelet `db6'. The horizontal, vertical and the diagonal components at both the levels are further decomposed to level five using histogram for each of the component using one dimensional wavelet transform. By finding global minima at level five, and then mapped at the component histogram, a threshold value is found out. The component then is thresholded using this adaptive threshold. The original image is then reconstructed with the obtained components using this course segmentation. The approximation component at level one is unaltered. Lastly a windowing technique is used to eliminate the false detection due to light in-homogeneity or due to hard tissues, which uses a window based threshold. Results after fine segmentation showed that normal patient images showed complete black region in the final segmented image whereas malignant images showed the region of interest after segmentation. The MRI images from a research institute were obtained and the results after segmentation were validated from an expert from the same research institute.},

But due to low radiation, quality of images is not fine they have noise and low contrast in visual impression. So for dentistry diagnostic purpose it is important to pre-process the CBCT image. This paper focuses on improvement of contrast, brightness and noise reduction of dental CBCT images by using Bi Histogram Equalization technique with bent activation function and adaptive median filter for noise reduction. The output image has been analyzed and evaluated using peak value ratio in term of Signal versus Noise (PSNR) and matrix of Structure in term of Similarity Index (SSIM). From the experimental results, it has been found that the adaptive median and Bi histogram with bent activation function has a better noise and enhancement capability as compare to convectional histogram method.},

abstract={Diabetes is an incurable disease where the body is not able to maintain the blood sugar level as the glucose in the blood is not utilize due to the destruction of the beta pancreatic cell of the liver. Blood sugar level of body is a very important factor for health and it should be maintain within the desired level or else this would result in complications and often serious damage to the body. Therefore treatment must be provided in case of high or low blood sugar level. In case of high blood sugar level, insulin must be injected and in case of low blood sugar level we should inject glucagon into the body. This paper is concerned on advanced method of simulation that can be used to implement a real insulin and glucagon pump that can work in real time to prevent the fatal effects of diabetes on body. This system also covers all the safety critical system aspect required to build a system that has a direct effect on human life. To provide better insulin and glucagon management and to reduce the need for human supervision, we have implement a control algorithm for the insulin and glucagon pump to automate the delivery process. The control algorithm adapts the glucose metabolic rate and determine the appropriate amount of insulin or glucagon to be delivered into the body. Method that is followed is effective and efficient in maintaining the blood sugar level. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system is very easy and user friendly that makes it easier for the patient and doctor to use. Different sets of testing were used to insure the safety and efficiency of the insulin pump simulation.},

abstract={This paper presents the time hopping (TH) visible light communication (VLC) system for an electromagnetic wave free indoor healthcare. VLC technology has emerged as an alternative wireless communication due to various advantages such as ubiquity, low energy consumption, no radio frequency (RF) radiation, and security against undesired network access. Significant bio-medical signal including the electrocardiography (ECG) can be transferred with VLC even in places where RF is forbidden. This potential advantage of VLC could save more emergency patients. The time hopping scheme is adopted to transmit multiple medical data with keeping a simple system design. Multiple data streams go through an optical detector including a photodiode and multiple data are separated by TH demodulator at the receiver. Each separated signal is then monitored to serve the necessary medical care for the concerned patient.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) systems enable the communication of a diverse suite of devices and objects, however it is known that security is one of the major problems in these systems. This is mainly due to the fact that IOT devices work with very limited computational power and energy budget and conventional cryptographic techniques will be too expensive. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid security protocol and demonstrate its suitability through a real time ambulance service tracking application. First, we discuss practical problem that is of lack of information shared during transfer of a patient in ambulance to hospital. We provide a solution to this with an IOT enabled ambulance tracking system. Second, we provide a secure protocol for IoT devices specific to the tracking system. The protocol uses implementation of AES-CCM optimized for IoT devices. It provides the basic communication requirements such as confidentiality, authentication and data integrity. The system work in a Server-Client model and we use dual channel to communicate with the IoT module. One secure channel (SMS), through which key exchange occurs, and one insecure(Internet), through which encrypted data is transferred. Finally, we present the evaluation metric of the proposed system including memory footprint and energy consumption.},

abstract={Ubiquitous Internet environment and matured key technologies of sensing devices provide diversified applications of Internet of Thing (IoT). IoT in intelligent healthcare is one of the major topics for convincing powerful functions of IoT regarding the promotion of national health policies, strategies, and plans. However, according to statistics reports, annual global mortality for cardiovascular diseases remained as high as 29%, of which coronary artery disease (CAD) is accounted for 42%. Unfortunately, almost half of the patients not knowing they are at risk of cardiovascular diseases until serious symptoms occurred. Here, we proposed an early warning system by integrating IoT, big data, and cloud computing technologies which physically linked among personal communication devices of patient/doctor, cloud systems, and hospital medical information systems. The system collects personal heart rate and metabolic equivalent (MET) features from calibrated fitness devices wore by users, and corresponding fitted curves are dynamically calculated and compared to previously trained curve patterns from 213 patients with heart diseases and 124 healthy individuals. The prototype system was already successfully developed and validated by a couple of testing cases with excellent performance. To ensure the robustness of the proposed system, now we are evaluating system reliability and trying to collect more testing samples for further validating effectiveness of the proactive healthcare mechanism.},

abstract={We demonstrate an end-to-end system prototype using Compressive Sensing (CS) to power-efficiently compress continuous bio-signals in a wearable body sensor network (BSN). We use a variant of a Binary Permuted Block Diagonal (P-BPBD) matrix encoder and pad the input signal symmetrically to achieve high compression ratios for ECG and PPG signals. In our approach, the gateway dynamically tunes compression parameters to adapt to changing signal sparsity levels during continuous monitoring and transmits them to the sensor node. We show that the power consumed by our encoder on a 32MHz Intel® Curie™ compute module is much lower than that consumed by a standard Wavelet-based (DWT) encoder. We also show how CS can simultaneously de-noise ECG signals during reconstruction. After evaluating multiple reconstruction algorithms, we demonstrate real-time signal recovery via an implementation of the Alternating Direction algorithm on a 500MHz Intel® Edison board, used as a gateway.},

abstract={Deadline constrained packet scheduling and transmission are important in real-time multimedia applications. This is because packets missing their deadlines would become useless and are frequently dropped, which seriously degrade the quality of service (QoS). As the utilization of Internet of Things has become mature, multimedia data transmission is a key component to promote the QoS of citizens. To fulfill the QoS requirement in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with multimedia content, the combination of multiple transmission methods is encouraged for packet forwarding, including conventional network coding, analog network coding, plain routing, and direct transmission (i.e., no-relaying, NR). The diversity of transmission method is helpful to lower packet dropping probability, while complicating the packet transmitting and scheduling process instead. Therefore, we first introduce an exhaustive search method to obtain the optimal scheduling sequence and corresponding transmission method for deadline constrained multimedia transmissions in WSNs. With the objective of promoting computing efficiency for the formulated problem, we then propose two heuristic methods based on the Markov chain approximation and the dynamic graph, respectively. Simulation results illustrate that our methods can effectively reduce packet dropping probability and simulation time, so that QoS of individuals can be promoted.},

abstract={The technology of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud has exposed devices to vulnerabilities. As they are distributed, the different devices communicate real time information to open, private or hybrid clouds, with the possibility of collecting, storing and analyzing big data streams in new forms. In the healthcare context, the increased deployment of IoT devices makes patient information a subject to malicious attacks depending on the security and privacy of the IoT devices. While a number of researchers have explored such security challenges and open problems in IoT, there is an unfortunate lack of a systematic study of the security challenges in the IoT for eHealth on clouds. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by conducting a thorough analysis of IoT security Vulnerability. We present then security challenges in the cloud for eHealth domain and recent proposed solutions. We also provide a proposition of an IoT system in the cloud.},

abstract={The privacy in eHealth is a serious issue that requires special considerations due to the sensitivity and importance of the shared patient's information. In the literature, several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed, most of them have focused only in content-oriented privacy, omitting the contextual privacy aspects. To cope with this deficiency, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme adapted to eHealth systems considering a normal and an emergency health scenarios. Our proposed scheme satisfies both content and contextual privacy requirements, as well as secure communications and quality of service (QoS). To do, we used an identity-based encryption scheme, a set of privacy mechanisms, and a prioritized queuing model. Moreover, we established a performance evaluation to study the queuing behavior of the proposed system. Extensive security analysis shows the robustness of our scheme. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed solution provides the first solution ensuring security as well as perfect privacy without neglecting any requirement.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={204-209},
abstract={In this paper, we have proposed novel framework for compressing the ultrasound images for IoT enabled telesonography. In ultrasound images, the diagnostic information is constrained to a particular region in the image, and sonographers look for that particular region for doing diagnosis. Therefore, by transmitting only that particular region to the remote sonographer, a significant compression can be achieved. Diagnostic information present in an image is organ specific, hence we came up with a framework to detect the organs and compress accordingly. We developed automated, semi-automated and manual algorithms for detecting the organs in an image. The automated and semi-automated algorithms for organ detection are based on Viola Jones and active shape model respectively. The detected organ is JPEG compressed and transmitted to remote sonographer through WebRTC technology. WebRTC enables direct browser-to-browser connection enabling fast and secure transmission of data. Organ detection algorithms are implemented through WebRTC and hence there is no need to install any softwares at the end devices. With the proposed framework, any ultrasound scanner can access service from the server, compress it and transmit to the expert end. The remote sonographer from anywhere can connect to the ultrasound scanner with his laptop, mobile, tablet etc., for doing diagnosis. The performance of proposed framework is evaluated by computing the compression efficiency on ten kidney ultrasound images.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) becomes important and various used in many applications. In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application. The application performance is evaluated by user satisfaction scores.},

abstract={The exponentially growing healthcare costs coupled with the increasing interest of patients in receiving care in the comfort of their own homes have prompted a serious need to revolutionize healthcare systems. This has prompted active research in the development of solutions that enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor and evaluate the health of patients in the comfort of their residences. However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.},

The complementary nature of the IoT and the could in terms of storage, processing, accessibility, security, service sharing, and components makes the convergence suitable for many applications. The advancement of mobile technologies adds a degree of flexibility to this solution. The health industry is one of the venues that can benefit from IoT-Cloud technology, because of the scarcity of specialized doctors and the physical movement restrictions of patients, among other factors. In this article, as a case study, we discuss the feasibility of and propose a solution for voice pathology monitoring of people using IoT-cloud.

abstract={There is a growing emphasis to find alternative non-traditional ways to manage patients to ease the burden on health care services largely fuelled by a growing demand from sections of population that is ageing. In-home remote patient monitoring applications harnessing technological advancements in the area of Internet of things (IoT), semantic web, data analytics, and cloud computing have emerged as viable alternatives. However, such applications generate large amounts of real-time data in terms of volume, velocity, and variety thus making it a big data problem. Hence, the challenge is how to combine and analyse such data with historical patient data to obtain meaningful diagnoses suggestions within acceptable time frames (considering quality of service (QoS)). Despite the evolution of big data processing technologies (e.g. Hadoop) and scalable infrastructure (e.g. clouds), there remains a significant gap in the areas of heterogeneous data collection, real-time patient monitoring, and automated decision support (semantic reasoning) based on well-defined QoS constraints. In this study, the authors review the state-of-the-art in enabling QoS for remote health care applications. In particular, they investigate the QoS challenges required to meet the analysis and inferencing needs of such applications and to overcome the limitations of existing big data processing tools.},

abstract={A progressive advancement in biosensors and wireless technology are the major contributors to the realization of continuous remote health monitoring system (RHMS). Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is part of this technology due to the deployment of multiple sensors such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) to collect vital body signals for processing and diagnosis. Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data. Generally, the presence of these problems in transmitting vital body signals may result in incorrect medical diagnosing which can increase mortality rate and cause severe impact to the overall system's performance. Thus, a suitable design of congestion control mechanism is urgently needed in designing a reliable and efficient remote health monitoring system.},

They first specify three design considerations for semi-automated tracking: data capture feasibility, the purpose of self-monitoring, and the motivation level.

This presented paper extends the underlying adaptive eHealth content management methodology to the coherent structural implementation of weighted majority voting algorithm. This cognitive human-machine interaction drives the targeted dynamically adaptive eHealth content management system in runtime mode. Telemedicine embraces information technology and telecommunication solutions for the sake of serving healthcare services at remote locations outside of the premises of classical medical institutions.

Utilizing cognitive services, the suitable methods determine the adequate system landscape delivering the suitable medical information from the collected body-sensory data. The underlying methodology utilizes correlation-data between different factors, thus invoking eHealth customizable cognitive content management system.

We propose a deployment model for the proposed Cyber-healthcare system, and describe a patient prioritization process as part of its situation awareness component. The results obtained from an experimental prototype reveal the field readiness of the off-the-shelf bio-sensor technology used by the system, the performance achieved when using a solar powered subsystem, the relative communication capabilities provided by its protocols and the network engineering feasibility of the planned community health care network. The relative efficiency of using supervised machine learning compared to unsupervised machine learning when performing patient prioritization, is also revealed through two popular algorithms: Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and K-means clustering (KMC).},

abstract={Technology plays the major role in healthcare not only for sensory devices but also in data transfer accordingly and displaying it. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environment, makes it possible for gathering rich information indicative of our physical and mental health in a smart approach. In this paper the Arduino based microcontroller is used as a gateway to communicate to the various sensors such as temperature sensor, ECG Sensor and pulse oximeter sensor etc. The microcontroller picks up the sensor data and sends it to the network through Bluetooth using Bluetooth module interfaced to Arduino. This paper mainly explains about detection of abnormalities in heart through specially designed ECG circuit and transmission of data to smart phone via Bluetooth. Hence provides real time monitoring of the health care parameters for doctors and care takers where data can be accessed anytime. This system is efficient with low power consumption capability, easy setup, high performance and time to time response. This paper explains in brief how IoT functions and how it is used in conjunction with wireless and sensing techniques to implement the desired healthcare applications.},

abstract={Fall needs to be attentively considered due to its highly frequent occurrence especially with old people - up to one third of 65 and above year-old people around the world are risk of being injured due to falling. Furthermore, fall is a direct or indirect factor causing severe traumas such as brain injuries or bone fractures. However, timely medical attention might help to avoid serious consequences from a fall. A viable solution to solve this is an IoT-based system which takes advantage of wireless sensor networks, wearable devices, Fog and Cloud computing. To deliver sufficient degree of reliability, wearable devices working at the core of a fall detection system, are required to work for prolonged period of time. In this paper we investigate energy consumption of sensor nodes in an IoT-based fall detection system and present a design of a customized sensor node. In addition, we compare the customized sensor node with other sensor nodes, built on general purpose development boards. The results show that sensor nodes based on delicate customized devices are more energy efficient than the others based on general purpose devices while considering identical specification of micro-controller and memory capacity. Furthermore, our customized sensor node with energy efficiency selections can operate continuously up to 35 hours.},

abstract={In today society there has been an increase in the number of elderly people that can fend for themselves. However, there are certain risks related to age such as falls, blood pressure or heart problems among others, that can result in serious consequences to the person. The objective of this study is the development of a system oriented IoT, which can be acquired by the low income population, allowing any member of the family to do a remote following up. One of the most serious problems is the falls. For this reason we started developing a module that can detect falls by using accelerometers and gyroscopes in this first stage, as a part of the daily elderly control integral system using the “Intel Galileo Gen I” development board. Selection criteria of the sensors used for this purpose together with corrections reading and data processing are described, because working with a sensor MPU6050 with Intel Galileo Gen I differs respect to other platforms. An analysis on different fall detection algorithms is done; false positives are discarded applying notifications alarms thus acquiring trustworthy data for their processing.},

abstract={In the last few years the process of monitoring people health status has grown in interest in the researcher community and led to the develop of new devices able to detect and analyse information gathered from many kind of sensors. These devices are commonly designed to monitor or diagnose disease in the medical field. Moreover, a remarkable interest is growing in the field of sports. In amateur activities such as jogging, running, climbing a set of smart devices are used to improve and monitor performances. Another field of interest is represented by those people that wants to monitor their health status by using low cost devices. In this work we propose a two stage fuzzy logic approach in which the device tries to learn and fit customer habits in order to discover outlier warning signals. The two stages approach proposed consists of monitoring the normal activities of the user in order to build a reference of its condition; Then a real-time monitoring and analysis of gathered data from body sensors is accomplished. User status is carried out using a Fuzzy Logic based network. First stage will give us the current activity of the user while second stage will provide information about health status in terms of heart rate.},

abstract={The paradigmatic shift brought by the Internet of Things has already revolutionized many key sectors, like environmental monitoring, grid and energy management, manufacturing, and it can be seen as a promising solution to address challenging societal issues, like the ability to provide significant enhancement to quality of life for the elderly and, in general, people in need. As a consequence, Internet of Things emerges also as the possible next evolution for the Ambient Assisted Living domain. One major issue to address in this context is the identification of a suitable middleware able to leverage the potentialities offered by the Internet of Things and, at the same time, ensure the necessary support to services and functions related to healthcare and personal assistance. This paper provides an overview of middleware solutions designed for Internet of Things in health and wellness domains, and presents a case study related to assistive technology for the home monitoring of people with dementia. It is illustrated how a specific middleware designed for telemetry applications, the MQTT, can be effectively applied in assistive scenarios too, with different architectural options and communication technologies.},

abstract={The last few years, significant advances which improve healthcare have been done in Internet of Things, in cloud computing, in video coding, and in mobile devices. This paper provides an overview of these advances. Also, we propose an IoT-based surveillance system for ubiquitous healthcare monitoring. The system consists of sensors, actuators, and cameras. Mesh topology was decided to be used as it provides important advantages. Moreover, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used for the data compression and transferring, and the Scalable High-Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) is used for the video compression and transferring. The SHVC can deliver the same video quality in half of the bit rate than the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Furthermore, cloud services are provided, such as storage and real-time monitoring. Finally, we made a comparative analysis between our proposed system architecture and two other approaches. From this analysis, we can say that our system architecture has some benefits instead of other similar architectures. Also, we made an analysis of the bandwidth and the network throughput. The results are significant since the bandwidth required for the transmission of data and video is reduced.},

Related to this issue, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) works to create better living conditions for older or disable people. AAL systems are able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sensors. In this paper, we propose an AAL architecture for the monitoring of elderly people, able to guarantee the collection of heterogeneous sensor data as well as the detection of critical events such as the older adult fall. A remote reasoning system processes this data with the aim of generating appropriate events. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a proof of concept was used and validation functional tests were carried out.},

abstract={Over 125,000 Americans die annually from not taking medication properly. Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.},

abstract={Many disease infection cases are acquired and spread in hospital settings. Early detection of such infection cases is necessary to identify population at risk accurately and effectively. This paper introduces a systematic infection detection framework utilizing mobile communication technologies including mobile networking and encounter statistics during infection breakouts. Our target environment is smart connected hospitals using Internet of things. First, the disease infection trace-back problem is defined. Then a detailed practical framework is devised using wireless encounters to facilitate the trace-back to the infection source and identify the population at risk; the nodes that are likely infected. Trace back and filtering methods are then proposed using probabilistic forward and backward search techniques. We use extensive WLAN campus traces of six buildings with different mobility characteristics and over 34K users to drive our simulations. Metrics of true positive, true negative, accuracy and coverage are measured and presented. Our results thus far show promise, where in most cases the accuracy of correctly selecting the infected nodes that have been in the area during the epidemic period were found to reach 70-80% with population selection coverage close to the infection percentage of nodes.},

This study suggests a model to transmit and manage patients' health and medical information safely through authorization in the IoT environment. Different with preceding studies that focus on saving patient information on the servers or improving access control, the proposed model considers threats related to process of patent information with efficiency. This study introduces a model where patients authorize representatives, who will be authenticated by hospitals, to transfer information to other hospitals safely for security, practicality, and efficiency. Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository. The advantage of this model is that it does not allow staff members or hospitals to collect information without patient's consent and thus reduces the risk of leaking patients' sensitive personal information to other places as the Token Repository saves nothing but the Access Token.},

abstract={Providing efficient routing service over tactical multi-hop ad-hoc networks is a crucial building block in wireless communication networks especially during a disaster relief. To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In this paper, we propose a new multi-hop routing approach called ORACE-Net. The proposed protocol uses advertisement packets to establish routes from deployed nodes towards the CC (i.e. Direct Route Establishment). Then, it utilizes the data packets to establish reverse routes (from the CC to all nodes in the network). We implemented and evaluated our approach in realistic scenario using tactical and on-body mobile nodes. Our experiments include also an Internet of Thing (IoT) platform and a real-time dynamic topology website which are used for analyzing the behavior of the protocol. The experimental results show that our protocol increases the mobile nodes connectivity and packet delivery rate. Also, it reduces the average round trip time delay for the on-body nodes compared to the tactical deployed base stations.},

abstract={Remote health caring of patients at home is increasing with the popularity of various nature of mobile devices that has developed to enable remotely caring. The cloud as well as IoT (Internet of Things) and the mobile technologies make it easier to monitor the patients health conditions by sharing the health information to health care teams such as doctors, nurses and specialists. However the guardians of the patients can be anxious about their patients when they are in work. By ensuring guidance awareness about the patients, it can bring more liability of the hospital management. We have demonstrated a health care system for hospital management to allow guardians along with doctors to remotely monitor health conditions of patients via internet. Remote monitoring and guidance awareness by sharing information in a authenticated manner are the main focus.},

abstract={Cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) are rapidly increasing in the urban lifestyle. CVDs rank #1 in the world when it comes to diseases causing deaths. More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. Around 17 million people died from CVDs in the year 2012, representing 31% of all global deaths. In India alone there are around 64 million cardiac patients and only 4000 cardiologists available. Arrhythmia is the most frequent occurring CVD. Patients having Arrhythmia require continuous monitoring so that the doctor can study the abnormality in their heart beats to gain further insights and suggest treatments. In some cases Arrhythmia can be fatal and might need immediate hospitalization. For this purpose, we have developed a system that remotely acquires ECG sensor readings (taken from MIT-BIH database) of the patient, processes it to predict arrhythmia intelligently and sends the indication alarm immediately to the doctor, when an Arrhythmia episode is detected. Also a report of the patient's heart behavior is generated and fetched to the doctor on his smart phone. Our system aims at spreading cardiac care to urban as well as rural places by enabling the remote monitoring the ECG signals of the afflicted cardiac patients and alerting the doctor in case of emergencies.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a design implementation of embedded system design that connects a variety of devices, sensors, and physical objects to a larger connected network (e.g. the Internet) which requires human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. While the IoT is expected to expand the user's connectivity and everyday convenience, there are serious security considerations that come into account when using the IoT for distributed authentication. Furthermore the incorporation of biometrics to IoT design brings about concerns of cost and implementing a `user-friendly' design. In this paper, we focus on the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to implement distributed biometrics authentication within an IoT system model. Our observations show that ECG biometrics are highly reliable, more secure, and easier to implement than other biometrics.},

abstract={Despite the phenomenal advances in the computational power and functionality of electronic systems, human-machine interaction has largely been limited to simple control panels, keyboard, mouse and display. Consequently, these systems either rely critically on close human guidance or operate almost independently from the user. An exemplar technology integrated tightly into our lives is the smartphone. However, the term “smart” is a misnomer, since it has fundamentally no intelligence to understand its user. The users still have to type, touch or speak (to some extent) to express their intentions in a form accessible to the phone. Hence, intelligent decision making is still almost entirely a human task. A life-changing experience can be achieved by transforming machines from passive tools to agents capable of understanding human physiology and what their user wants [1]. This can advance human capabilities in unimagined ways by building a symbiotic relationship to solve real world problems cooperatively. One of the high-impact application areas of this approach is assistive internet of things (IoT) technologies for physically challenged individuals. The Annual World Report on Disability reveals that 15% of the world population lives with disability, while 110 to 190 million of these people have difficulty in functioning [1]. Quality of life for this population can improve significantly if we can provide accessibility to smart devices, which provide sensory inputs and assist with everyday tasks. This work demonstrates that smart IoT devices open up the possibility to alleviate the burden on the user by equipping everyday objects, such as a wheelchair, with decision-making capabilities. Moving part of the intelligent decision making to smart IoT objects requires a robust mechanism for human-machine communication (HMC). To address this challenge, we present examples of multimodal HMC mechanisms, where the modalities are electroenceph- logram (EEG), speech commands, and motion sensing. We also introduce an IoT co-simulation framework developed using a network simulator (OMNeT++) and a robot simulation platform Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP). We show how this framework is used to evaluate the effectiveness of different HMC strategies using automated indoor navigation as a driver application.},

pages={2298-2301},
abstract={The paper is about the work done for the requirement of gait analysis on the shoe for a limped person. The method adopted can help the doctor to treat a person with gait abnormalities. Gait analysis deals with the study of walking pattern, in order to understand the gait abnormalities. To treat these gait abnormalities it's necessary to analyse gait parameters such as foot angle, stride distance, step distance, step count, cadence, speed, progression line etc. This project presents a shoe device to measure these parameters with the help of various sensors such as accelerometer, ultrasonic sensor, gyroscope, foot pressure sensor, flex sensor etc. These sensors can be placed in the shoe such that sensors can accurately measure these parameters. The digital output of these sensors can be integrated through a controller and the result of the patient is sent to the doctor's phone or to a GSM device. Hence, this wireless shoe device helps to overcome the disadvantages of the existing system which is practiced in gait motion analysis laboratory. Results of shoe device can be compared with the gait of a normal person in order to differentiate and study the abnormal and normal gait of a person. The development of shoe device is mainly concerned with features like low cost, portable, ease of use and accurate measurements of gait parameters. The objective of shoe integrated sensor system for gait analysis is to provide better digital output results of the abnormal parameters and efficient way of analyzing than clinical gait. This device has various applications in sports for exercise training, medicinally in treating paralyzed patients and in biometric and forensics to identify/improve individual patient by making minor variations.},

abstract={Right now about 334 million people across the globe are suffering from asthma. People with asthma are sensitive to things which may not bother normal people at all. For example they may feel uncomfortable with increased levels of smoke, pollen or fog in air. The number of people suffering from asthma has been rising sharply over the years, pollution being one of the biggest reasons. Though controlling pollution is a broad topic, but preventing oneself from asthma is an easier way out. It is important to keep track of what triggers asthma attack in a patient, because symptoms do not occur right after the exposure to the triggering parameters. The delay in attack occurs depending on how much the person is sensitive to the factor. Thus we try to propose a model of a smart asthma prediction system using Internet of Things.},

abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},

abstract={Social Network Analysis becomes an important field of research focusing on studying users' data and its contributions on social network media. The goal of this study is to build relations between people in the disease field and to analyze certain knowledge or activities. In order to accomplish these goals, investigators become very interest in social network analysis to conclude certain behavior or prediction from various data in social networks. People in the field of sociology expect that the relationship between people and the real-life style can be mirrored in the social networks. On the other hand, manual classification of unstructured data from social networks is almost impossible. Therefore, there is a required for an automatic classification method in order to formulate this data and to be more convenient and accessible. In this paper we are studying data of diseases from Facebook pages. These diseases are associated to the categories of popular diseases such as Ebola, Malaria and HIV/AIDS. In this paper we addressed classifier as a supervised learning task and an innovative dataset named Benchmark Dataset for Diseases Classification (BDDC) is created. BDDC is well-documented dataset and its file formats and compatible with recognized text mining tools and to be utilized in the comparative experiments by other researchers. Three commonly classifiers are used and two versions are BDDC are used. The performance results show that BDDC with stemmer performs better than the one without stemmer because of using stop words filtering and porter.},

abstract={Mobile government is an innovative research area where efforts are made to advance governmental and public services. As such, in this paper, we propose a crisis management system for real-time emergency notification of users using mobile applications and smart watches. We develop an intuitive web portal using a client server architecture for governmental agencies to easily and efficiently notify users within the range of danger in the occurrence of a disaster through SMS or push notifications to the mobile application or the smart watch, if the latter is available. Moreover, real-time mapping for indoor localization systems are utilized for user navigation to the nearest exit with the added feature of floor plans for public locations that may be accessed offline for the convenience of the users. The system is also designed for instant emergency aid assistance in case of a medical personal difficulty through the use of the developed dedicated bilingual multi-platform mobile application.},

abstract={Anomaly detection plays a critical role in various smart living scenarios. However, achieving effective detection while not imposing burdens on users is never an easy task. To solve this problem, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm using light switches is proposed. By using an unsupervised approach, care takers in nursing homes do not need to label the collected data. By using information generated by smart switches, senior citizens are not forced to use wearables, change the battery or feel privacy invasion from cameras. Our solution adopts the statistical-based algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). By adding constrains to reduce the high variances of the mixture model and recursively removing the extremely-low probability data from the model, a more accurate mixture model can be constructed. Our experiments in a real apartment show that the false alarm rate can be reduced by at least 56% compared to the existing cluster-based algorithms when the targeted miss detection rates are low.},

abstract={The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.},

abstract={In the context of health and social care, it is important to provide assistance to individuals in their own home by coordinating the activities of several actors. The coordination of processes of different organizations is a complex task which requires continuous attention. Process mining techniques have been widely used to discover hidden information useful to understand the behaviour of a single process. Thanks to the spread of Internet of Things (IoT), this complex activity can benefit also from the huge amount of data collected for other purposes. In this paper we propose techniques for exploiting the information available in the environment, considering several sources of information to analyse the interconnections of business processes. We apply the proposed approach to a health-care scenario enriched with IoT devices. The proposed techniques allow the discovery of interconnections between processes and external factors which have an impact on them.},

abstract={E-Health services can take advantage of the technological achievements in the area of the Internet of Things (IoT), and of the cost reduction and increasing user-friendliness of health monitoring devices. Homes equipped with environmental sensors, physiological parameters monitoring devices, and home automation devices, could become the “hardware” of an “operating system” for application developers and service providers. The system would expose web services through a unique cloud infrastructure for users' data collection and storage, administration and billing, and healthcare service provisioning applications by possibly multiple third parties. We present an instance of a cloud-based web server which relies on a “home system” for the collection of information from an heterogeneous set of devices, providing a high level description of the proposed overall architectural model, of the induced opportunities from the market perspective, and of how it could be used by healthcare applications developers and service providers, including details on how the web server Application Programming Interfaces (API) is implemented in our instance.},

abstract={Planning the deployment of antennas in complex environments is a difficult task that requires the analysis of each specific scenario. In many cases, real measurements are taken so as to map signal strengths, interferences, and so on. However, taking real measurements is very time consuming and becomes impractical in complex, large scenarios. With the aim to avoid this burden, simulation techniques based on Ray Tracing, combining Geometric Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction, are used to predict waves' behaviour within a given environment. Those simulations depend on a number of parameters, namely angular resolution, number of rebounds, cells size, etc. By tuning these parameters, high-definition (HD) and low-definition (LD) results can be obtained. Although more practical than manual measurements, the computational cost of simulations in HD prevents their use in complex environments and their LD counterparts are applied. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) that allows the use of LD simulations (with low computational cost) by lessening their low quality problems. The proposed CF strategy exploits spacial constraints in 2D propagation planes to improve simulation results, which end up being very similar to those of HD, with a fraction of its computational cost.},

abstract={Understanding the propagation dynamics of information/an epidemic on complex networks is very important for discovering and controlling a terrorist attack, and even for predicting a disease outbreak. As an effective method, with analyzing the structure of a propagation network, a large number of previous studies have analyzed the propagation dynamics. Most of these studies are based on a special network structure to make such analysis. However, a propagation network has dynamically changed structure during the propagation. How to track, recognize and model such dynamic change is a big challenge. Along with the popularity of smart devices and the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive mobile data is automatically collected. In this article, as a typical use case, we investigate the impact of network structure on epidemic propagation dynamics by analyzing the massive mobile data collected from smart devices carried by the volunteers of Ebola outbreak areas. From this investigation, we obtain two observations. Based on these observations and the analytical ability of Apache Spark on streaming data and graphs, we propose a simple model to track and recognize the dynamic structure of a network. Moreover, we introduce and discuss open issues and future work for developing this proposed recognition model.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Computation and infotainment are the two major areas where Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) electronics have made major contributions. Moving forward we expect to see their dominance in automotive applications. At the same time, we are seeing increased interest in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect trillions of sensors. We are preparing for Internet of Everything (IoE) applications where people, process, data and devices are going to be connected through new generation of electronics which are not possible today. Therefore, our research is focused on hybrid integration of heterogeneous materials, processes and devices to build free form (flexible, stretchable, reconfigurable in shape and size) interactive and high-performance electronics and systems for smart living and a sustainable future focusing on healthcare, water, food and environment. For scientific exploration, we develop integration strategy to make collective use of the materials, processes and device architecture leveraging multidisciplinary tracks of electrical engineering, material science, bioengineering, computer science and engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering (focusing plants and marine science) and health science. As engineering tool, we use CMOS technology extensively due to its industrial relevance, maturity and reliability for rapid tech transfer. In my talk, I will discuss the advances we have made to make tomorrow's applications available today. Specifically I will be using some examples which are commercially relevant and/or under commercialization: (i) healthcare devices; (ii) 3D printed smart objects with embedded electronics; (iii) plug and play smart electronic platforms with integrated sensors and actuators and (iv) physically reconfigurable shape systems.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a paradigm that connects devices and objects through the network to share information. Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.},

But still the learner often require time to assimilate the protocols to follow while using vibrotactile actuators, i.e. to respond in the direction of vibrations or in the opposite direction, which is often confusing for novice learner, and especially for elderly people. We present the potential use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to increase the efficiency of vibrotactile actuators in such scenarios. The proposed system discusses about the vibrotactile actuator placement over the limb, which is intended to be move, along with the correct placement of electrodes over the controlling muscles to enhance the overall feedback system used in motor learning. It acts as an add-on to eliminate the unnecessary protocols related to tactile motion guidance. We also show that the proposed system is economically efficient, and non-invasive. We also discusses about the use of surface Electromyography sensors for predicting the excitation potential for the FES feedback and its application for motor rehabilitation for stroke patients.},

Compared to actual nurse calling systems, the proposed transmitter neither needs batteries nor long wires to provide energy. Therefore, it is maintenance-free and can be easily installed. The key feature of the proposed system is that it will harvest its energy from motion. When a patient presses the push button to call a nurse, the mechanical energy converter will convert this small movement into electrical power, and then a radio signal is sent to the receiver module. This activates an alarm at the nurse station's display. Also, this alarm is forwarded to other platforms such as nurse's smart phone and smart watch. The goal of this work is to develop a smart, green, and wireless system unlike most of current nurse calling systems in which are not necessarily the case.

In this paper, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system has been designed in order to create better living conditions for older people. In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home. A remote reasoning system processes all collected data with the aim of generating appropriate events and alerts. The architecture was validated from a functional point of view through a proof-of-concept.},

abstract={Compressed sensing (CS) has exhibited great potential for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In CS-MRI, we want to reconstruct a high-quality image from very few samples in a short time. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm, called projected iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (pISTA), and its acceleration pFISTA for CS-MRI image reconstruction. The proposed algorithms exploit sparsity of the magnetic resonance (MR) images under the redundant representation of tight frames. We prove that pISTA and pFISTA converge to a minimizer of a convex function with a balanced tight frame sparsity formulation. The pFISTA introduces only one adjustable parameter, the step size, and we provide an explicit rule to set this parameter. Numerical experiment results demonstrate that pFISTA leads to faster convergence speeds than the state-of-art counterpart does, while achieving comparable reconstruction errors. Moreover, reconstruction errors incurred by pFISTA appear insensitive to the step size.},

abstract={Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed aberrant brain functional networks in individuals with generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS). Little is known, however, about these changes in functional hubs across different frequency bands. In this study, we applied a data-driven method named complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) to decompose the whole brain BOLD time series into five frequency-specific bands. Then, we compared alterations of frequency-specific functional hub across five different frequency bands in 21 GTCS patients to 22 normal control (NC) subjects. CTCS patients showed aberrant functional hubs predominately at some particular frequency bands and primary in the default mode network (DMN) and the somatomotor network (SMN). Furthermore, we found these hub located in the DMN at a higher frequency band was associated with disease severity. These findings provide an overview of frequency-specific hub, and may be helpful in uncovering abnormal neuronal activity in patients with GTCS at specific frequency bands.},

Considering the future vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), many requirements and challenges rise to the design and implementation of such systems. Bridging the gap between sensor nodes on the human body and the Internet becomes a challenging task in terms of reliable communications. Additionally, the systems will not only have to provide functionality, but also be highly secure.

pages={1850-1861},
abstract={Objective: Improve the reconstructed image with fast and multiclass dictionaries learning when magnetic resonance imaging is accelerated by undersampling the k-space data. Methods: A fast orthogonal dictionary learning method is introduced into magnetic resonance image reconstruction to provide adaptive sparse representation of images. To enhance the sparsity, image is divided into classified patches according to the same geometrical direction and dictionary is trained within each class. A new sparse reconstruction model with the multiclass dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain imaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling patterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art magnetic resonance image reconstruction methods. Conclusion: Artifacts are better suppressed and image edges are better preserved than the compared methods. Besides, the computation of the proposed approach is much faster than the typical K-SVD dictionary learning method in magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Significance: The proposed method can be exploited in undersampled magnetic resonance imaging to reduce data acquisition time and reconstruct images with better image quality.},

abstract={The recent advances in sensor/actuator and RFID technologies have spun out a new healthcare model enabling capture and dissemination of patient vital signs over the Internet for ubiquitous monitoring of these patients anytime and from anywhere. This provides new opportunities for enhancing healthcare through participatory consultation, medical diagnosis and many other novel healthcare services. Some of the advantages of this emerging technology referred to in this paper as “Cyber-healthcare” includes low acquisition cost, flexible deployment and improved accuracy resulting from replacing manual operations by fully digitized processes. It is expected that the emerging healthcare technology will change the way healthcare is delivered in both rural and urban settings of the developing world by building upon this technology to leapfrog from poorly prepared to medically equipped environments capable of tackling some of the most challenging medical issues of the developing world such as patients' vital signs capture, patient prioritization and preparedness to virus outbreaks such as Ebola. This paper proposes a Cyber-healthcare system as a first step towards the implementation of least cost digital health systems in the developing countries. We assess the field readiness of the off-the-shelf sensor technology used by the system and evaluate the performance of its underlying patient prioritization module using two machine learning algorithms: 1) multivariate linear regression and 2) support vector machine.},

The main concern of this paper is the IoBNT, which projects the prospective application domain where the activities of very tiny, biocompatible, and non-intrusive devices operating in an in-body nanonetwork can be monitored and controlled through the Internet. In this paper, we present an illustrative scenario and system model of an IoBNT for application in an advanced healthcare delivery system. To address one of the major challenges of the IoBNT, we present an exemplary architecture and model of a bio-cyber interface for connecting the conventional electromagnetic-based Internet to the biochemical signaling-based bionanonetwork. The bio-cyber interface is designed and modeled by employing biological concepts, such as the responsiveness of certain biomolecules to thermal and light stimuli, and the bioluminescence phenomenon of some biochemical reactions. The analysis in this paper focuses on the system that comprises the bio-cyber interface and the information propagation network of the blood vessel that leads to the in-body nanonetwork location. The effects of the system and design parameters associated with the IoBNT models presented are numerically evaluated.},

Emerging brain-computer interface (BCI) consumer products have accelerated new tool development to be blended seamlessly in rehabilitation, education, and entertainment. It has been observed that, while some of these developments flourish via collaboration, others tend to proliferate. To continue the recent commercialization advancement in BCI headsets, it behooves the industry to standardize EEG brain signal collection to form an open databank to allow data exchange via the Internet. Specific issues are raised with respect to the fundamental harmonization of brain states and its linkage to EEG signals for big data analytics and Internet of Things connectivity.

abstract={This paper examines techniques to embark upon the Quality of Service (QoS) issues in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) using the Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP) framework. The design of QoS in WBAN is a challenging task due to several reasons such as lossy channel, resource-constraint nodes and priority-based services. The QoS provisioning mechanisms mostly focus on the MAC layer and do not extend easily across all platforms. We propose to integrate the QoS design into the application layer using the standard CoAP framework. CoAP architecture is a platform independent standard intended to be used in simple electronics devices such as Internet of Things (IoT). We introduce three CoAP features such as Caching, Confirmability and Multicast addressing. We examine these options to deploy the QoS mechanism in the WBAN composed of sensors with heterogeneous priorities. The proposed solutions are universal and can be deployed on any sensor platform which supports the standard CoAP software protocol.},

abstract={An unhealthy lifestyle, such as lack of exercise, poor diet, and drinking alcohol excessively can increase the risk of chronic disease. With the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and the emergence of the wearable devices, it is possible to monitor important aspects of our daily life, with the aim of encouraging healthier lifestyles. This paper proposes a personal healthcare system that will allow the user to track their daily activities such as exercise, sleeping, heart-rate and diet, using only a smart watch and phone. The monitored data, behavior analysis and feedback from user's doctor can be shared via cloud services, and visualized using charts and tables. Users also can chat with an artificial intelligent agent that deals with related questions via a mobile app.},

abstract={As to studies on the human brain, researchers merely have focused on the structure, function, etc. of the encephalic region, and the cascading failure of the encephalic region is yet to be explored. Here, we recruited 15 age-matched normal people as the experimental group. We got Pearson correlation coefficient of 90 brain regions by using the resting brain functional connectivity and structured connection matrix by using one sample T test. Then, according to the load capacity model algorithm, each brain area node was assigned a certain amount of load. We selected the important node of the default mode network (DMN) to attack, and found that the scale of big degree attack cascading failure was greater than the small degree attack. Protecting the important brain areas is of great significance to prevent the brain diseases.},

abstract={Smart Home products spread is restrained due to several reasons including poor usability and fears of the personal data security [1,2]. Our research team suggested Smart Home solutions based on the user behavior analysis and modeling [3]. We also studied application of this approach to different householder needs (like healthcare or imitation of the user's presence [4]). We showed that the approach also critically improve the usability of the Smart Home. Finally, we described the methodology for analysis of the householder's behavior and simulation of his activities. So “offline” solutions based on this approach allows protecting privacy and provide good usability (“offline” means here partly or completely disconnected from the external operating signals and observations). At the same time they have some disadvantages including relatively low quality of predictions [5]. In this paper we discuss how the tuning of parameters of the previously suggested methodology provides improvement of the user needs predictions. The results of primal tests of this approach are presented and analyzed.},

The idea of this project came so to reduce the headache of patient to visit to doctor every time he need to check his blood pressure, heart beat rate, temperature etc. With the help of this proposal the time of both patients and doctors are saved and doctors can also help in emergency scenario as much as possible. The proposed outcome of the project is to give proper and efficient medical services to patients by connecting and collecting data information through health status monitors which would include patient's heart rate, blood pressure and ECG and sends an emergency alert to patient's doctor with his current status and full medical information.},

abstract={Together with the development of technologies such as those for ubiquitous computing, data mining, Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the concepts of smart cities and mobile health (m-Health) have emerged. Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen. Besides the description of the application, the main contribution of the article is the analysis of the emerging privacy issues of the proposed application and the discussion of possible countermeasures.},

abstract={Stable cloud services and global infocommunicational infrastructure capabilities are enabling for the first time in our history the worldwide interoperability of classical medical systems, telemedicine instruments, health-related smart devices and smartphone-apps. In this paper we present a unified service architecture with the corresponding common interface recommendation for integrating classical medical systems from the following areas: interconnection of telemedicine systems, hospital information systems, legacy health care systems, smart health devices and health-related smartphone-apps. Emerging IoT-technologies open new horizons also for medical care solutions. Stable cloud architecture technologies deliver the comprehensive back-end infrastructural basis for dealing efficiently with the foreseeable human medical data boom. Classical medical supply chains and institutions will establish and open IT-interconnection capabilities interacting with smart end-user devices. Collection, aggregation and evaluation of massive health-related data streams call for common architectural platform with unified interfaces. Telemedicine solutions with IoT connectivity handle massive number of active device connections and produce significant unstructured sensor data-flows. As different sensor data implies varying data transmission, processing and storage techniques, there is a remarkable demand for a general and common interface standard. This will enable the flawless interaction among classical legacy medical systems, industrial telemedicine devices, smart-devices and smartphone health-apps via both internet (LAN, WLAN, GSM, etc.) and peer-to-peer (Bluetooth, NFC, etc.) connections. Inevitably arise security and ethical considerations concerning access of sensitive medical data with regard to different domestic and regional regulations. Recent remarkable innovations, like direct Bluetooth LE internet browser support, highlights the further perspectives of the described commo- open telemedicine hub and infrastructure with the recommended interface hierarchy.},

abstract={Following a surgical procedure, patients are monitored in an ICU until physically stable, after which are discharged to a ward for further evaluation and recovery. Usually, ward evaluation does not imply continuous physiological parameters monitoring and therefore patient relapse is not uncommon. The present paper describes the steps taken to design and build a low-cost modular monitoring system prototype. This system aims to offer mobile support in order to facilitate faster and better medical interventions in emergency cases and has been developed using low-power dedicated sensor arrays for EKG, SpO2, temperature and movement. The interfaces for these sensors have been developed according to the IoT model: a central control unit exposes a RESTful based Web interface that ensures a platform agnostic behaviour and provides a flexible mechanism to integrate new components.},

abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.},

Conventional uniform medical services are incomplete because changes of healthy condition show great differences for each person caused by lifestyles, interactions of health obstructive factors and so on.

The fog interface is a low-power embedded system that acts as a smart interface between the smartwatch and the cloud. It collects, stores, and processes the speech data before sending speech features to secure cloud storage. We developed and validated a working prototype of FIT that enabled remote processing of clinical speech data to get speech clinical features such as loudness, short-time energy, zero-crossing rate, and spectral centroid. We used speech data from six patients with PD in their homes for validating FIT.

In this paper, we discuss how a standard Machine-to-Machine (M2M) middleware is a key enabler of our e-health platform and SenseMyCity crowdsensor, powered by the use of smartphones as M2M gateways. M2M standards provided by ETSI/oneM2M are essential for a paradigm shift, aiming at making the IoT truly interoperable without the need for human intervention. In this work, we map two applications that rely on the role of a smartphone as a gateway, which acts as a proxy to connect legacy devices to the IoT using a standard middleware. We illustrate the advantages of using M2M, and, as a proof-of-concept, we measure and quantify the energy savings obtained, showing improvements of smartphones' battery life.},

This paper presents a polymorphic, multi-behavioral MAC protocol called PEAM (Polymorphic, Energy-Aware MAC Protocol) designed to support WBANs used in ubiquitous healthcare monitoring systems. The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states. PEAM was designed based on cross-layer constructs that allow across the layers synchronization and coordination orchestrated by the application layer and targeting the Data link layer services. PEAM has also been enabled to interplay with IPv6 networks through interaction with the 6LowPAN middleware. This protocol was evaluated and compared to the well-known IEEE 802.15.4 standard using the network simulator OMNET++, and exhibited clear superiority.},

abstract={Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is one of the major causes of death among infants during their sleep. To increase the safety of the infants, we matched different emergent research fields for the development of Baby Night Watch. This Smart Wearable System (SWS), developed under the context of the European Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge (TIIC) 2015, is composed by the following elements: a Wearable IoT Device, a Gateway and the H Medical Interface. The Wearable IoT Device is a wireless sensor node integrated in a Chest Belt, and it has the capacity to monitor the following parameters: body temperature, heart and breathing rates and body position. After a minimal data processing, this set of information is sent to the Gateway, via ZigBee technology, and it is accessible to the user through the H Medical Interface. If a critical event occurs, the device will trigger an alarm, visible and audible in the proximity, and sends a distress message to a mobile application. The Baby Night Watch is an important tool for medical studies, since it allows the visualization of previous physiological data and export it to different types of datasets. Experimental tests have proven that the SWS has the potential to identify situations that could be potentially life-threatening for an infant.},

abstract={In a world deploying an Internet of Things, sensors and actuators are owned, accessed, and activated by a plethora of individuals and organizations. Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of "things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we "acquire" and "distribute" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions. The scheme puts users (including organizational entities) in the center of control over the access to their collections of sensory data. In our paper, we describe a deployment of these ideas for health care, smart cities, and autonomous cars.},

abstract={With the growth in elderly population in Singapore, healthcare expenditure and prevalence of age-related illnesses are expected to increase. Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

abstract={Nowadays there is a rich diversity of sleep monitoring systems available on the market. They promise to offer information about sleep quality of the user by recording a limited number of vital signals, mainly heart rate and body movement. Typically, fitness trackers, smart watches, smart shirts, smartphone applications or patches do not provide access to the raw sensor data. Moreover, the sleep classification algorithm and the agreement ratio with the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG) are not disclosed. Some commercial systems record and store the data on the wearable device, but the user needs to transfer and import it into specialised software applications or return it to the doctor, for clinical evaluation of the data set. Thus an immediate feedback mechanism or the possibility of remote control and supervision are lacking. Furthermore, many such systems only distinguish between sleep and wake states, or between wake, light sleep and deep sleep. It is not always clear how these stages are mapped to the four known sleep stages: REM, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3-4. [1] The goal of this research is to find a reduced complexity method to process a minimum number of bio vital signals, while providing accurate sleep classification results. The model we propose offers remote control and real time supervision capabilities, by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This paper focuses on the data processing method and the sleep classification logic. The body sensor network representing our data acquisition system will be described in a separate publication. Our solution showed promising results and a good potential to overcome the limitations of existing products. Further improvements will be made and subjects with different age and health conditions will be tested.},

abstract={A number of apps currently exist to aid users in finding a better lifestyle or to control their food intake by having better nutritional advice at their fingertips. The mobile nutrition area is widely popular with thousands of people around the world accessing information related to nutrition and wellbeing. However, mobile nutrition apps still can offer more to their users by providing better overall Human Device Interaction (HDI). As nutrition apps are used daily, it is imperative to ensure that users can easily grasp their concept, thus allowing them to quickly understand and receive the information they require to achieve a better lifestyle. The problem lies with HDI elements associated with these apps. This research paper highlights the problems with HDI in mobile nutrition apps through an investigative survey. The questionnaire based quantitative survey was used to understand the patterns associated with mobile HDI in the nutrition landscape and how the user interacts with the mobile app throughout the nutrition tracking process. Respondents clearly showed that the following main problems: difficult to input information into the mobile app, too time consuming to complete, not motivated in any way and also a poor overall user interface. The survey results have enabled us to conclude a number of points that greatly impact the overall HDI of nutrition apps. This was of great importance as it laid the foundations to investigate and explore further opportunities in this area.},

Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. In our previous work we have defined and provided IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS). As IoT is aimed to connect everything to Internet, there are billions of sensors which are attached to things to access data and connect these things to internet. So the data provided by these sensors is growing very fast. We need to handle this big data on personals gadgets as well on central databases. To deal with this problem, in this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems.

abstract={The wide dissemination of Internet around the world changed the way people communicate among them. The evolution of the information and communication technologies (ICT) or artificial intelligence (AI) allowed the creation of new types of services involving electronic devices with huge potential. The emergence of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) is one of such potential example. Combining the IPA concept with the recent paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT), offers new possibilities and new services to end users, since they could learn more about other entities present in the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a novel mobile gateway solution for a ubiquitous mobile health scenario, in which information gathered from a body sensor network (BSN) is used by an IPA belonging to another person, typically mentioned to as caretaker. The mobile gateway receives real time information related to location, heart rate, and possible falls of the monitored person and acts as a communication channel between the BSN sensors and the IPA platform. Furthermore, the paper presents a performance evaluation study of the proposed mobile IoT-based gateway demonstrating and validating its feasibility.},

abstract={With the growing interest on wireless network architectures for hospital management services is a renewed demand for efficient and reliable data transfer between the doctor and the patient. Voice and data traffic carried over a variety of access technologies is collected via technology-specific access networks like, Digital Subscriber Line [DSL], Passive Optical Network [PON], and Wireless Fidelity [Wi-Fi]. Metro and core networks need to aggregate the various user flows from different access network nodes and provide scalable and cost-effective distribution of various flow types (e.g., Internet access, voice, video on demand, and broadcast TV services) to the relevant service access points. Among the most promising applications provided by IoT is the latest and emerging internet technology. Internet of things is a growing network of everyday object-from industrial machine to consumer goods that can share information and complete tasks while you are handling many works in a place. This paper proposes a support to developed Wireless Hospital Digital Interface (WHDI) technology using the gateway of hardware and software, Wi-Fi protocol data and the ZigBee protocol data conversion method and integration of cloud networking to provide the doctors to do complete monitoring and control functionalities of the hospice environment using wireless sensors and actuators modules to interface wirelessly to all sources within their hospital and storing the data in the cloud.},

abstract={Due to the increase in elderly population, research in healthcare monitoring and ambient assisted living technology is crucial to provide improved care and at the same time contain the healthcare cost. Among existing systems, there is none robust system that can act as a bridge between different systems to facilitate knowledge sharing, so as to empower the detection and prediction capabilities of them. These systems cannot use the data and knowledge of other similar systems due to the complexity involved in sharing data between them. Storing the information is also a challenge due to a high volume of sensor data generated by each sensor. The proposed HEAL model is a platform that provides services to developers to leverage the previously processed similar data and the corresponding detected symptoms. The proposed architecture is cloud-based and provides services for input sensors, Internet of Things devices, and context providers. The ultimate goal of the system is to fill the gap between symptoms and diagnosis trend data in order to predict health anomalies accurately and quickly.},

abstract={The urge to document our lives isn't new, and as readers of this column, you're no doubt well aware of the many new self-tracking technologies-particularly those related to health. A large part of the appeal of health tracking devices stems from their seeming objectivity. Built on sensors and algorithms, these systems appear neutral and consistent, impervious to human frailties and whims. Yet for many, use of these self-tracking techniques and technologies isn't straightforward. Here, we unpack four tensions surrounding self-tracking and discuss the role of quantification in understanding ourselves.},

abstract={In Internet of Things (IoT) environment, IoT devices are limited to power supply, CPU capacity, memory, etc. and have a constrained network performance such as bandwidth, wireless channel, throughput, payload, etc., the resources of IoT devices however can be shared by other IoT devices. Specially, in IoT healthcare service, the way of management and interoperability of patient-related and device information are very important. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of an IoT healthcare system using ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD (Personal Healthcare Device) and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) standards in order to enhance the interoperability and reduce the data loss between the devices and measured information while in transmission. To demonstrate the proposed architecture, we implement comparative performance evaluation between HTTP and CoAP in terms of the number of packets in one transaction, the number of packets by data loss rate in during transmission and a syntax usage between XML and JSON.},

abstract={As a major driver of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors are harvesting data, from their environments, that service providers make use to trigger the appropriate services. These service providers require access to a wide range of personal data, which are often sensitive. In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving trust model based on the observation that a large class of applications can be provisioned based on simple threshold detection. The key issue we address in this work is how to minimize privacy loss in the presence of untrusted service providers so that providers are prevented from disclosing information to third parties for secondary uses. Our work can be considered as a lightweight approach to functional encryption (FE) for privacy-preservation. The main algorithm in the proposed model is a uniformization scheme that uses a combination of sensor aliases to hide the identity of the sensing source and per-function initialization vector to reveal information only to relevant service providers. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed scheme on TelsoB, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed scheme on resource-constrained devices.},

abstract={A massive growth of collaborative frameworks, where web services, internet of things, mobile applications and digitization of enterprise processes leads to generate massively heterogeneous data termed as Big Data. Handling the heterogeneity of such data by a distributed file management system based database such as H-Base having limitation to handle only structured form of the data. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for managing data heterogeneity in three basic types i.e. 1) centralized structured data to distributed structured data, 2) unstructured to a structured format and 3) semi-structured to a structured format. The performance of proposed method is evaluated in a real-time prototype experiment and in future we planned to compare to work on a data transform method in the specific context of health care data addressing performance metrics such as memory consumption and request per write. The experimental outcomes of the proposed system show how the processing time is reduced even when we process data of large size, thereby showing the effectiveness of presented approach.},

abstract={Lifestyle related ailment is resulting in a need for close medical attention for larger number of people. In this regard, systems that can provide proactive health related alert would be beneficial. e-Health and telemedicine offer powerful tools to improve efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services. The focus of this paper is to design a low cost, reliable e-Health monitoring device using IoT based platform architecture that can measure the vital health parameters of an individual, securely store the data in server and analyze the data for generating proactive alerts as applicable. The platform also connects the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patients' health data. Vital health parameters are measured using simple, non-restricting electrical sensors. The platform has outlier detection capabilities and is designed to send alerts to patients and their respective doctors in case any anomaly occurs. Thus, the proposed solution can be used to provide clinical healthcare at a distance, hence enabling the inclusion of elderly or homebound patients and those who are located in the remotest corners of the country within the realm of healthcare services.},

When the doctors examine illness by infrared image, in addition to the observation the image directly, they often need to use the means of computer image processing to analyze the image. In addition, it is very difficult to avoid the interference of external factors in the process of collecting infrared image, which can form variety thermal noise. So the infrared image noise reduction processing is very necessary. But the image is still in a relatively narrow range after the noise reduction, so using image enhancement algorithm to deal with the infrared image is necessary. Through the comparison analysis, it is found that the weighted histogram equalization algorithm in the enhancement of image contrast, which can not only retains the shape and trend of the original gray histogram, but also retains image details to a large extent. After image noise reduction and image enhancement, the foundation for the subsequent processing is laid.},

abstract={With the research and application of wireless sensor networks are widely used in the medical field. It is put forward higher requirements for its reliability, flexibility and high efficiency. Changeable and unpredictable characteristics of the medical field environment are major factors that lead to the reliability decline in medical wireless sensor network. Finding a reliable path is an effective means of solving the network reliability. This paper analyzed the medical sensor network characteristics and requirements. Aiming to the special needs of the medical wireless network, a reliable multi-path routing protocol (RRMP) was proposed. The RRMP was based on links stability prediction by lists of neighbor's nodes. And the reliable multi-path is realized by means of calculating path reliability factor and path delay factor. Simulation results show that the algorithm can obtain higher delivery ratio and lower end-to-end packet delays than the existing routing protocols.},

abstract={Healthcare is very important factor in every body's life and Information technology is playing an important role in providing better health with number of advances. Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology. Due to its popularity in technology and internet world, IoT is rising in every field of life and so in health sector. Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. But it's still not implemented for the broad scope of Hospitals, and especially in Pakistan it's not being used for any purpose in health sector. So we need to define and provide IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS). In this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems. We have used Context awareness as middleware above network layer to overcome the problem of data management. Moreover we did survey to investigate the decision to adopt the IoT based system in Pakistani Hospitals. Survey was questionnaire based. The accumulated results indicate that participants want to adopt this system and most of the population agreed that IoT based HMIS would provide better monitoring, communication and early diagnosis.},

abstract={The adoption of the Internet of Things paradigm in Ambient Assisted Living platforms requires the investigation and analysis of issues related to data collection and processing. In fact, the peculiarities of Ambient Assisted Living services and applications pose specific requirements on the way data originated from sensors should be processed (locally or remotely), delivered (as raw data, or in aggregated fashion), and, of course, how they should be shared or protected. This paper analyses the issues related to data management starting from a review of the state of the art, in order to draw general trends or widespread approaches, that are then discussed and evaluated with respect to a practical implementation presented as a case study.},

abstract={On Internet of Things (IoT), everything can be accessed anytime, anywhere, and works without human intervention. In IoT everything collaborates to deliver services and applications to users, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) being one of these applications. Some AAL smart homes uses infrared sensors to recognize some activities of daily living and to track people along the environment. Location tracking is vital in Ambient Assisted living and can be a useful information to improve AAL systems. A common problem in such systems is that each tracking model is based on a specific sensor's placing architecture. In order to assure that the system will work properly, the model has to be fitted by an expert. Modeling is usually costly and it relies on a specific architecture. In our previous work, the tracking model needed to be fitted manually. In order to introduce adaptability, this work proposes an approach to automatically fit the model avoiding the need of an expert to fit a different model for each kind of sensor's placing architecture. The proposed approach was evaluated using real data from a set of pyroelectric infrared sensors and a set of scenarios performed in a simulated apartment.},

abstract={One of the most promising instantiations of the Internet of Things (IoT) are mobile health (mHealth) systems, which promise to deliver intelligent health monitoring and assisted living as well as advanced and integrated health services. To realize the full potential of these services, fragmented and heterogeneous data that is generated by different segments of the system need to be consolidated in order to support high-quality processes. This paper proposes a tiered data integration scheme for mHealth systems that works on the schema, entity, and event levels. The proposed scheme incorporates an algorithm that merges and ranks sensor streams for schema integration and event identification, and performs contextual record registration and deduplication for entity resolution. We tested the proposed integration scheme on two sets of sensor-based mHealth data related to human activity recognition. Preliminary results show that the proposed integration scheme contributes to enhancements in event identification precision compared to the classification performance of separate datasets produced within the same mHealth system.},

abstract={Adaptive security can take dynamic trade-off decisions autonomously at runtime and is considered a key desirable attribute in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, there is no clear evidence that it can handle these trade-offs optimally to add value to such a complex and dynamic network. We present a scenario-based approach to recognize and evaluate typical security trade-off situations in the IoT. Using the Event-driven Adaptive Security (EDAS) model, we provide the assessment of dynamic trade-off decisions in the IoT. We have showed that an optimum trade-off mitigation response in the IoT can be automated by assessing various contextual requirements, such as the QoS and user preferences, thing capabilities, and the risk faced, at runtime. eHealth scenarios are examined to illustrate system application in IoT-based remote patient monitoring systems.},

abstract={Internet Of Things (IoT) is one of the major topics in computer science. The connection of IoT to applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is common in order to propose practical solutions. Simultaneously, games are known to increase interest and motivation among students when they are designed with pedagogic intent. Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them. But as our application gathers information that are relevant for remediation, it is also a forward useful solution to doctors who are always busy and who might check the display of children without an actual meeting.},

Those who leverage many services provided by public and private clouds call this the tipping point, or the point where the number of services being managed becomes so high that's it's impossible to manage them properly without a governance model, approach, and service governance technology. So, how do you implement service governance for the cloud? This article looks at both the concept of cloud governance, including why it's needed, and how to do it. It breaks down governance into its component parts, explains each part, and examines how to implement service governance for your cloud implementation.},

abstract={This paper presents a batteryless system-on-chip (SoC) that operates off energy harvested from indoor solar cells and/or thermoelectric generators (TEGs) on the body. Fabricated in a commercial 0.13 μW process, this SoC sensing platform consists of an integrated energy harvesting and power management unit (EH-PMU) with maximum power point tracking, multiple sensing modalities, programmable core and a low power microcontroller with several hardware accelerators to enable energy-efficient digital signal processing, ultra-low-power (ULP) asymmetric radios for wireless transmission, and a 100 nW wake-up radio. The EH-PMU achieves a peak end-to-end efficiency of 75% delivering power to a 100 μA load. In an example motion detection application, the SoC reads data from an accelerometer through SPI, processes it, and sends it over the radio. The SPI and digital processing consume only 2.27 μW, while the integrated radio consumes 4.18 μW when transmitting at 187.5 kbps for a total of 6.45 μW.},

abstract={Telemedicine systems for remote monitoring are gaining importance given the increase in aging population. Possible limitations to their diffusion in daily living situations can lay on usability and social acceptability barriers. In this work we propose an architecture for remote monitoring and management of motor disorders applied on Parkinsonian patients suffering of Freezing of Gait (FoG). The architecture is composed of a smartphone app, a database (DB) and a web app, hence it uses only technologies that are well known and diffuse among society. The smartphone app monitors gait parameters and provide acoustic feedback (cues) to the patient when it detects a FoG episode. Furthermore the app stores all the informations collected in a local DB and periodically sends them to the central DB when Internet connection is available. The web app provides graphic user interfaces to query the DB to observe FoG monitoring data and to remotely adjust patient's rehabilitation and pharmacological therapies. The architecture was tested on 6 Parkinsonian patients, results about FoG detection accuracy and cues effectiveness are reported.},

abstract={Seamless connection of molecular nanonetworks to macroscale cyber networks is envisioned to enable the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, which promises for cutting-edge applications, especially in the medical domain. The connection requires the development of an interface between the biochemical domain of molecular nanonetworks and the electrical domain of conventional electromagnetic networks. To this aim, in this paper, we propose to exploit field effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs) to devise a molecular antenna capable of transducing molecular messages into electrical signals. In particular, focusing on the use of SiNW FET-based biosensors as molecular antennas, we develop deterministic and noise models for the antenna operation to provide a theoretical framework for the optimization of the device from communication perspective. We numerically evaluate the performance of the antenna in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the electrical output.},

abstract={Football, also called soccer, is one of the most popular sports in the world, if one considers the number of fans as well as the number of players. However, footballers face serious injuries during the match and even during training. Concussion, hypoglycemia, swallowing the tongue and shortness of breath are examples of the health problems footballers face, and in extreme cases, may lead to death. In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health. This paper proposes an IoT-based architecture for the sport of football, called IoT Football. Our proposal aims to embed sensing devices (e.g. sensors and RFID), telecommunication technologies (e.g. ZigBee) and cloud computing in the sport of football in order monitor the health of footballers and reduce the occurrence of adverse health conditions. The aim is to integrate the IoT environment, in particular the IoT application, into the field of sport in the form of a new application.},

abstract={Cities increasingly face challenges related to pollution, efficient use of resources (e.g. water, energy) and ensuring a good quality of life for its citizens. Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives. A need for inter-continental automated testing facilities such as those developed by TRESCIMO is identified through which integrated experiments can be conducted to provide insight and answers.},

abstract={In this paper, an integrated wearable application platform with physiological sensors are presented. We use the wearable devices to collect the electrocardiography (ECG) and respiration (RESP) signals. This wearable device is a prototype with analog front-end, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth module. We attach the electrodes on the thorax to record single-lead ECG signal and thorax impedance variation of the users. The mobile phone is a platform for dealing with the digital signal processing. We design an Android app with convenient user interface for every application. With discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we can easily detect the important features such as P wave, QRS complex and T wave and reduce the interference of noise. We develop an application with the wearable device for the emotion recognition. The extracted-features of biomedical signals are implemented with methods by the cloud computing. We implement the cloud computing by Apache Storm, which can transmit the data by streaming via 3G/Wi-Fi. With the proposed stream processing framework for the relaxation state calculation with wearable ECG sensors, under 5 people monitoring simultaneously, the latency and response time can be reduced by 10 times.},

abstract={The explosive growth of the internet, the overall computerization of the engineering, medical, business and defense sectors have created a widespread need of visualization techniques to explore large and complex datasets. As the data keeps growing in complexity, users find it difficult to navigate and understand the relationships between the sets. There are limitations such as scalability and sub-optimal layouts being produced with the state-of-the-art visualization methods such as Euler diagrams, Treemap diagrams and ConSets. So, an effective visual method is in great need to produce an optimal layout and identify set properties with ease. This motivated us to develop a novel visual method called “Spherule diagrams” to improve the analysis of set relationships effectively. Then a small-scale user preference study was conducted to compare Euler diagrams with Spherule diagrams, where 80% participants preferred Spherule diagrams for its simplicity, navigation, better layout and set ordering characteristics. The other results based on error rate and rating, Spherule diagrams outperformed Euler diagrams. Thus, we provide evidence that Spherule diagrams are preferred over Euler diagrams for visualizing set relations.},

abstract={Diagnosis of breast cancer analysis disease becomes one of an open discussion and a crucial need in Egypt. The analysis of these datasets for patients is important for the early detection and prediction of the disease. The usage of case-based reasoning (CBR) systems and the machine learning techniques provides us with several techniques to easily decide whether the patient is healthy or not. In this paper, we proposed a case- based reasoner architecture that aid physicians to early detect and predict breast cancer disease. As a retrieval technique Rough Sets Theory (RST) is applied followed by two different classifiers to improve the classification accuracy of the medical data. Results yield to 96% accuracy for 103 out of 108 instances and 82% classification accuracy after the usage of two different classifiers other than the RST (Neuro-Fuzzy and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers).},

pages={1331-1338},
abstract={The existing search engines retrieve information only based on the keywords. The incapability to search on the basis of the relation between the keywords and the user concepts, generates noise and hence, results in irrelevant retrieval. This leads to the idea of performing Semantic information processing by mapping the user's Concept and Context of the query with the retrieved results to filter (remove) noise from the query. The present study suggests Noise Removal for Semantic Information Processing (NRSIP) framework for the Search Problem (SP): find expert(s) in Panjab University. The framework allows the user to perform categorical search. Instead of inputting all the keywords, it allows the user to select the best matched option from the available choices to formulate the Semantic Query (SQ). The relevant information for the SQ is then retrieved by the Present Search Engine (PSE) used. The performance analysis shows that the proposed NRSIP framework improves the retrieval time and effectiveness for retrieving relevant web documents as compared to PSE.},

To resolve the problem with limited medical resources, constant monitoring of elders' activity of daily living is important. We propose an activity recognition system for smart home, so elders can live alone and their children can monitor their parents' living activity to achieve the concept of "Aging in Place". The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past. We demonstrate the living activity monitoring model is feasible to be deployed in a living home with high accuracy performance of the activity recognition result.},

abstract={Diabetic ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},

Apart from diagnosis, radiologists can use the tumor location to past case studies relevant to the present patient study, which can aid in the treatment of the patients.

After recognition of the letter, the output in the form of its correct pronunciation is generated via the IVRS. In the Write Mode the accelerometer continuously monitors the motion of the pen and indicates through the IVRS if any motion is anomalous with regard to a particular letter.

abstract={This paper explains a Raspberry pi controlled remote monitoring system. Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized single board computer with ARM11 microprocessor. In this study, a system is designed to continuously monitor the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other vital parameters. This data is stored in a database and can be displayed in a website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel. This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task. The obtained results are presented.},

abstract={Blood is most essential constituent in human body. Blood centers collect, process and transport blood to hospitals and other health care centers. Sometimes blood is collected directly from blood donors rather than taking it from blood bank. Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases. The proposed system is a web based application which helps to reduce the human mistakes or errors and different techniques can be applied for blood type classification, diagnosing diabetic symptoms, classifying blood type and identifying different donors reaction and apply preventive measures against them.},

The past few years have seen some great medical innovations which are helping cure and prevent diseases which were earlier thought incurable. Despite such huge improvements, many of the engineering innovations are yet to be realized to its full potential in the medical industry. The field of assistive technologies for the visually impaired has been such a realm. Assistive technologies have been there for many years but the scope and application of these technologies have been very limited. The recent advances in the computer vision and inertial navigation systems can be easily employed in this field to give much more control to the visually impaired. The advent of low cost IMU's and GPS has led to huge advancements in these areas.

abstract={This paper presents a method to predict an epileptic seizure using synchrony analysis of EEG signals. The topographical map of the brain is divided into different regions and synchrony measures are computed between these different regions to identify the region responsible for epileptic seizure. The molecular and biochemical process of seizure generation during pre-ictal period is essential for seizure to start and this property has been investigated here in EEG signals to predict the onset of epileptic seizure. Particular region of the brain responsible for seizure is identified by pairing the EEG signals from different regions of brain and identifying the changes in synchrony measures corresponding to those regions. Two synchrony measures one from time domain, correlation, and other from frequency domain, coherence, are used in this work to validate the observations. Coherence and correlation increases in pre-ictal state and hence seizure onset can be predicted in advance. The results shows that epileptogenic region of the brain can also be identified.},

abstract={The strong development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is changing traditional perceptions of the current Internet towards a vision of smart objects interacting with each other. In this vision e-health applications are one of the most promising applications in IoT. However, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality constitutes the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme for an e-health application. This scheme allows both of sensors and the Base Station (BS) to authenticate each other in order to secure the collection of health-related data. Our scheme uses nonces and Keyed-Hash message authentication (HMAC) to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides authentication with less energy consumption, and it terminates with a session key agreement between each sensor and the Base Station. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that our scheme saves energy. In addition, it is resistant against different types of attacks.},

pages={1-4},
abstract={This work proposes an ultralow power highly linear analog front-end (AFE) with an input dynamic range from 200μVpp to 20mVpp. The system consists of a signal conditioning instrumentation amplifier (IA), two programmable gain amplifiers (PGA), a mixed signal automatic gain control (AGC), two sample and hold (S/H), a 10 bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC), and a ΣΔ modulator with 10 bit effective number of bits (ENOB). A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32. The proposed system is intended to be powered by an energy scavenging circuit without compromising its own performance. The system was successfully tested for an ECG signal obtained from PTB database.},

To demonstrate the 3D-graphene foam sensors, we constructed an armband muscle measurement using such sensors and developed software based on IoT for real-time muscle expansion and stretch tracking. Wi-Fi was used to transfer data from the sensor to a cloud via web-socket based on Node.js. The data are display expansion of muscle on a website. This muscle stretch tracking is very useful in many contexts such as workout performance measuring, rehabilitation and tele-robotics application. The wearable stretch sensor is consisting of two pieces of 5 centimeters 3D-graphene foam strip and packed with clasped by conductive epoxy. For accuracy, at the end of sensor edge are coated with silver paste for better conductivity. Main CPU uses Intel Edison, which made the sensor connect to the Internet easier. In order to deploy this sensor with another application the ADXL335 was chosen as a 3-axis accelerometer for tracking of gestures or fitness tracking application. An accelerometer was attached to the down side of the Intel Edison main CPU board and including battery and analog to digital converter circuit.},

abstract={Mobile Health (mHealth) is now emerging with Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud and big data along with the prevalence of smart wearable devices and sensors. There is also the emergence of smart environments such as smart homes, cars, highways, cities, factories and grids. Presently, it is difficult to quickly forecast or prevent urgent health situations in real-time as health data are analyzed offline by a physician. Sensors are expected to be overloaded by demands of providing health data from IoT networks and smart environments. This paper proposes to resolve the problems by introducing an inference system so that life-threatening situations can be prevented in advance based on a short and long term health status prediction. This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud. The inference system can also resolve the problem of data overload in sensor nodes by reducing data volume and frequency to reduce workload in sensor nodes. This paper presents a novel idea of tracking down and predicting a personal health status as well as intelligent functionality of inference in sensor nodes to interface IoT networks.},

abstract={The wide-spread use of wearable devices and mobile apps in the Internet of Things (IoT) environments makes effectively capture of life-logging personal health data come true. A long-term collection of these health data will benefit to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration. But most wearable devices and mobile apps in the market focus on personal fitness plan and lack of compatibility and extensibility to each other. Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation. Also, the demand on high security increases difficulties of designing reliable platform for integrating and managing multi-resource life-logging health data. This paper investigates the possibility of collecting and aggregating life-logging data with the use of wearable devices, mobile apps and social media. It compares existing personal health data collection solutions and identifies essential needs of designing a life-logging data aggregator in the IoT environments. An integrated data collection solution with high secure standard is proposed and deployed on a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare platform: MHA [15] by integrating five life-logging resources: Fitbit, Moves, Facbook, Twitter, etc. The preliminary experiment demonstrates that it successfully record, store and reuse the unified and structured personal health information in a long term, including activities, location, exercise, sleep, food, heat rate and mood.},

abstract={Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.},

abstract={As a key health indictor, daily physical activity (PA) data has great significance on diagnosis and treatment of many chronic diseases. Numerous studies have been carried out for accurately monitoring and assessing physical activity. Most attentions of these studies focus on designing standalone highly accurate wearable sensors or investigating advance machine learning algorithms to train these PA data in a controlled environment. But the wide use of cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps makes it possible to monitor and access PA into a more open and connective Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Yet, it still lacks of a systemic survey on how to effectively transfer classic PA monitoring and assessment (PAMA) technologies into a heterogeneous device connected IoT environment. In an effect to understand the development of IoT technologies in PAMA, this paper reviews current research of PAMA technologies from an IoT layer-based perspective, and also identifies research challenges and future trends. A main contribution of this review paper is that it is first attempt to categorize classic PAMA technologies into an IoT architecture systematically.},

abstract={Internet of Things technology provides a competent and structured approach to improve health and wellbeing of mankind. One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism. Our experimental results reveal that fog computing helps achieving more than 90% bandwidth efficiency and offering low-latency real time response at the edge of the network.},

A unique aspect of our research is personalized individual stress analysis including three stress levels: low, medium and high. Using machine learning algorithms from the ECG signals alone, we could achieve 88.24% accuracy in detecting the three classes of stress.

abstract={The modelling of healthcare process is inherently complicated due to its multi-disciplinary character. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been considered and applied to model and demonstrate the flexibility and variability of the activities that involved in healthcare process. However, with the growing usage of digital information and IoT technology in the healthcare system, the issue of information security and privacy becomes the main concern in term of both store and management of electronic health record (EHR). Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place. BPMN is lacking of the ability to model and present security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a suitable way. This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult. In this paper we provide a solution to model the security concepts in BPMN by extending it with new designed security elements, which can be integrated with the BPMN diagram smoothly.},

abstract={The development of wireless technologies allowed users to access nearby devices whenever and wherever they want. The Internet of Things (IoT) allows home electronics to be connected to each other, and its impact is expanding to a new domain called the wearable devices. Meanwhile, it is still not common for a wearable device to interact with any nearby devices since they are operated in different platforms especially when devices are manufactured by different vendors. It would be more problematic as the number of wearable devices and vendors are expected to grow dramatically in the near future. Thus, to leverage interoperability, a global standard for wearable devices is highly recommended. Under these circumstances, Standards Developing Organizations (SDO) such as ITU-T, ISO/IEC JTC 1, W3C, and OIC have recently initiated works in relation to wearable devices. The authors have analyzed the relevant standardization and provided strategic action points to foster global standardization on the Internet of wearable things.},

abstract={Social and socially-enabled applications have established themselves as a large and important set of scenarios that make sense in personal as well as in enterprise settings. However, it is still not clear how to best promote an open and extensible ecosystem of social applications. This makes it hard to design and implement applications that are good SOA citizens and can participate in an open and growing set of social interactions. Our work presents an architecture and implementation based on Activity Streams, which uses and slightly extends the format to work as a foundation for a SOA that allows applications to bridge vertical silos in the Internet of Things. In this paper, we discuss the application of our architecture in several different domains and our findings from mashing up applications across silos using Activity Streams. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of this approach, we believe that our work can serve as illustration and guidance in the ongoing effort to standardize the next version of Activity Streams.},

abstract={Serious games have been in focus of an increasing number of research efforts in the health domain over the last decade. Their maturity led researchers to increase their efforts on approaches and techniques that will facilitate the adoption of these games by older adults in their daily life. As real users' home is the desired destination of serious games, researchers have started taking them out of the lab settings. Towards this and aligned with the technology acceptance model, perceived ease of use is considered as a primary determinant affecting attitude towards ICT use. Therefore, contemporary mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, smart Tvs, etc.) can play essential role as means of delivering serious games. However, full body activity exergames seem to be more demanding in terms of transferring their technology from the well-established desktop applications to mobile and web technologies. Fortunately, web and mobile technology advancements can handle the emerged challenges. This paper presents the background of exergames on mobile devices and the technologies around them and gives insights on the available technologies that can be used to move full body exergames from desktop applications to web browsers. More specifically, this papers exhibits the future of gaming controllers in the Internet of Things domain and how this would accelerate full body exergames through mobile devices.},

abstract={To evaluate the quality of a person's sleep it is essential to identify the sleep stages and their durations. Currently, the gold standard in terms of sleep analysis is overnight polysomnography (PSG), during which several techniques like EEG (eletroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram), EMG (electromyogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) and for example respiratory airflow and respiratory effort are recorded. These expensive and complex procedures, applied in sleep laboratories, are invasive and unfamiliar for the subjects and it is a reason why it might have an impact on the recorded data. These are the main reasons why low-cost home diagnostic systems are likely to be advantageous. Their aim is to reach a larger population by reducing the number of parameters recorded. Nowadays, many wearable devices promise to measure sleep quality using only the ECG and body-movement signals. This work presents an android application developed in order to proof the accuracy of an algorithm published in the sleep literature. The algorithm uses ECG and body movement recordings to estimate sleep stages. The pre-recorded signals fed into the algorithm have been taken from physionet1 online database. The obtained results have been compared with those of the standard method used in PSG. The mean agreement ratios between the sleep stages REM, Wake, NREM-1, NREM-2 and NREM-3 were 38.1%, 14%, 16%, 75% and 54.3%.},

In this study, we propose an IoT framework where medication intake is ensured with real time continuous activity recognition. We present our use case with the focus of application and network layers. We utilize an activity classification scheme, which considers inter-activity detection consistency based on non-predefined feature extraction as the application layer. The network layer includes a gateway structure ensuring end-to-end reliability in the connection between a wireless sensor network (WSN) and Internet. Results obtained in simulation environment suggest that the selected application and network layers introduce a feasible solution for the medication intake use case.},

abstract={Technology advancements as well as the Internet-of-Things paradigm enable the design of wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems. Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},

abstract={Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.},

abstract={The concurrent popularity of wearable sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) brings significant benefits to body sensor networks (BSN) that could communicate with the cloud computing platforms for bringing interoperability in health and wellness monitoring. We designed Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity. The first set of results is promising and demonstrates the prospect of Pulse-Glasses in the field of cloud-connected BSN.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) provides an unprecedented opportunity to realize smart automated systems such as smart manufacturing, smart city and smart home in the past few years. Pervasive sensing and mobile technology deployed in large-scale IoT systems lead to the accumulation of big data. In particular, wearable biosensing accelerates human-centered computing for smart health management. However, limited work has been done to develop advanced IoT technologies for smart monitoring and control of heart health. There is an urgent need to develop a new IoT technology specific to the heart, namely Internet of Hearts (IOH) that will enable and assist (1) the acquisition of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals pertinent to space-time cardiac dynamics at anytime anywhere; (2) real-time management and compact representation of multi-sensor signals; (3) big data analytics in large-scale IoT contexts. This paper presents a new technology of Mobile and E-Network Smart Health (MESH), which is composed of 4 components as follows: 1) Mobile-based ECG sensing device; 2) Space-time representation of cardiac electrical activity; 3) Optimal model-based representation of ECG signals; 4) Dynamic network embedding for disease pattern recognition. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrated that network analytics is efficient and effective for smart health management in IoT contexts. The MESH technology shows strong potentials to provide an indispensable and enabling tool for realizing smart heart health and wellbeing for the population worldwide.},

Four emotions are chosen for this study namely engagement, excitement, meditation and frustration. By understanding this relationship, diagnosis of an emotional imbalance can be done and brainwave optimization can be implemented in the place of medication when treating emotional imbalances. This paper shows that emotions can be distinguished by examining the EEG waveform in the power density spectrum. The difference of EEG waveforms before and after optimization for the aforementioned emotions is shown to demonstrate the effect of music on emotions.},

Based on RGB colour theory, the system was implemented using a myRio board, which interacts with a mobile application. Bio-samples (urine) gathered from volunteers were tested using this board and with a hand-held refractometer. The results showed that it is possible to infer the BHL by analysing the blue values of RGB colour and by comparison with the recommended urine colour chart.

With increasingly powerful hardware, the ability to express complex ideas and concepts in code becomes more important. Given the importance of developing safe and secure software for these applications, it is interesting to observe that the vast majority of software for these devices is written in the C programming language -an inherently unsafe language as compared to other modern languages.

Based on this cognitive process, each EEG sample is divided into three parts. Average amplitude in time domain and LZC (LempelZiv Complexity) was computed for the divided part of each EEG sample and used to extract features from the EEG signal.

pages={1-1},
abstract={This work performs a rigorous, comparative analysis of the fog computing paradigm and the conventional cloud computing paradigm in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), by mathematically formulating the parameters and characteristics of fog computing – one of the first attempts of its kind. With the rapid increase in the number of Internetconnected devices, the increased demand of real-time, low-latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional cloud computing framework. Also, our irreplaceable dependency on cloud computing demands the cloud data centers (DCs) always to be up and running which exhausts huge amount of power and yield tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. In this work, we assess the applicability of the newly proposed fog computing paradigm to serve the demands of the latency-sensitive applications in the context of IoT. We model the fog computing paradigm by mathematically characterizing the fog computing network in terms of power consumption, service latency, CO2 emission, and cost, and evaluating its performance for an environment with high number of Internet-connected devices demanding realtime service. A case study is performed with traffic generated from the 100 highest populated cities being served by eight geographically distributed DCs. Results show that as the number of applications demanding real-time service increases, the fog computing paradigm outperforms traditional cloud computing. For an environment with 50% applications requesting for instantaneous, real-time services, the overall service latency for fog computing is noted to decrease by 50:09%. However, it is mentionworthy that for an environment with less percentage of applications demanding for low-latency services, fog computing is observed to be an overhead compared to the traditional cloud computing. Therefore, the work shows that in the context of IoT, with high number of latency-sensitive applications fog computing outperforms cloud computing.},

Thus, personal career planner (PCP) via brain-computer interface (BCI) proposed in this paper to complete the career assessment through the analysis of instant brainwave response corresponds to the prompted questions. Those excitement levels are retrieved by using Emotiv neuroheadgear and are distributed evenly to the respective questionnaires. The questionnaire is designed based on Dr. Holland career theory - The Holland Codes. The system will then classified accordingly and upshot the recommended career opportunities. This paper includes experiments to prove that brainwaves can response instantaneously to external stimuli, which are the major concerns in the proposed system. Lastly, the system is tested together with written assessment. The proposed PCP via BCI achieves the reliability of 87.5%.},

To address this problem, three key techniques were developed in this work for DPS pixels: wide-range adaptive body biasing, low-gating of the 2-transistor in-pixel comparator and digital readout performing delta-reset sampling with low switching activity and robust timing closure. These concepts were demonstrated by designing and fabricating a 128 × 128 CMOS image sensor array in a 65 nm low-power CMOS logic process. Operating at 0.5 V, it features an FPN of 0.66%, a dynamic range of 42 dB and a fill factor of 57% with a 4 μm pixel pitch, while consuming only 17 pJ/(frame.pixel) and 8.8 μW at 32 fps. These performances combined with the small silicon area of 0.69 mm2 makes the imager perfectly suitable for integration in ULP SoCs, targeting WSN applications.},

abstract={Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices permit the massive collection of biosignals (e.g., heart-rate, oxygen level, respiration, blood pressure, photo-plethysmographic signal, etc.) at low cost. These, can be used to help address the individual fitness needs of the users and could be exploited within personalized healthcare plans. In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity. State of the art solutions are also compared with our approach.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources. In this paper we report on developments made to-date in various technical areas with respect to critical issues such as cost, power consumption, scalability, interoperability and privacy.},

abstract={Healthcare and tourism are among the fastest growing business domains in the world. These are biggest service industries that affect whole world population and give jobs to millions of people. Recently we witness major changes in both industries, as more services are transferred to small providers, including individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people. This provides a huge space for developing and applying new business models. In this paper we summarize research and development results of IoT studies and discuss ideas on how to apply them to business.},

abstract={With the pervasiveness of smartphones and the advance of wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs), mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) has attracted considerable interest recently. In m-Healthcare, users' smartphones serve as bridges connecting their WBSNs and the healthcare center (HCC), i.e., send users' personal health information (PHI) collected by WBSNs to the HCC and receive the feedback. However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can realize privacy-preservation and achieve secure end-to-end communication for m-healthcare, and is suitable for resource-limited WBSNs.},

In fact, in traditional methods the number of sensors connected are minimized, sampling rate is less and even has a restriction over types of signal in sensors. Using reconfigurable smart sensor interface the complexity of the code can be reduced in IoT environment. In the proposed system, FPGA is taken as the main logic controller. It can parallel process the data in real time. It is smaller in size and has finer grain capability. It works faster than CPLD. This system uses IEEE1451.2 standard; this gives an intelligent sensor interface between sensors in robot.

abstract={Among the panoply of applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart and connected health care is a particularly important one. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environments, make possible the gathering of rich information indicative of our physical and mental health. Captured on a continual basis, aggregated, and effectively mined, such information can bring about a positive transformative change in the health care landscape. In particular, the availability of data at hitherto unimagined scales and temporal longitudes coupled with a new generation of intelligent processing algorithms can: (a) facilitate an evolution in the practice of medicine, from the current post facto diagnose-and-treat reactive paradigm, to a proactive framework for prognosis of diseases at an incipient stage, coupled with prevention, cure, and overall management of health instead of disease, (b) enable personalization of treatment and management options targeted particularly to the specific circumstances and needs of the individual, and (c) help reduce the cost of health care while simultaneously improving outcomes. In this paper, we highlight the opportunities and challenges for IoT in realizing this vision of the future of health care.},

abstract={The cost and effort for developing personal healthcare systems with IoT devices can be substantially high mainly due to complex inference capabilities. To tackle the problems, we proposed INFerence-as-a-Service (INFaaS) in our previous work. INFaaS is a cloud service which provides a core set of common functionality required to develop various context-aware applications. Since INFaaS is designed for generic purpose, its applicability and genericity should be verified in that sense. In this paper, we present a comprehensive case study of developing an IoT-based Personal Healthcare System with the INFaaS cloud framework. This system requires various inference algorithms to diagnose diseases with the acquired medical contexts, which will increase developers' overhead. We believe that a cloud service providing inference services such as INFaaS yields a tremendous benefits in terms of cost benefits.},

The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor network, together with the Android edge router, form a mobile sub-network that allows seamless information exchange with the Internet and improves service availability for each end user.

abstract={With increased in digitization the amount of homogeneous, unstructured, semi-structured, structured or heterogeneous data being created and stored is exploding is collectively called “Dataspace”. Data being generated from various heterogeneous sources like, digital images, audio, video, online transactions, online social media, data from sensor nodes, click streams for different domains including, retails, medical, healthcare, energy, and day to day life utilities. In business, industries, institutions and organizations, individuals contribute the data volume like technical reports, seminar reports, research papers, dissertations, thesis etc. For instance, 30 billion web pages are accessed or the World Wide Web. With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms. In this we also explained how ranking can be used in Dataspace with challenges to information retrieval from heterogeneous data or from Dataspace.},

abstract={Nowadays, flexible electronics is a challenging research area cause of the increase of electronics component request for “the internet of things”, the food safety and the medical diagnostic applications. In our research, we work with an unusual substrate for microtechnologies such as paper, which is flexible, brittle, and biodegradable. Also, it can be folded, cut, perforated, crumpled, etc. This article focuses on monitoring porous Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) layer on paper-based substrate for the detection of humidity. Porous AAO is a material with cylindrical pore geometry and high aspect ratio. Further, this material has many advantages, such as, easy fabrication, pore diameter's uniformity with high pore density (1011/cm2) and its use like humidity sensors. In summary, the AAO process fabrication on paper substrate is challenging causes of his ease of implementation, cost-effective and the use of a highly economical, conformable and ecological substrate. In this study, an experimental setup had been developed to anodize an aluminum layer deposit on flexible substrate by using phosphoric acid. Various anodization parameters (voltage, current density, temperature and concentration) have been investigated to obtain an AAO layer with good electrical properties and high reliability on flexible substrate. An interdigital capacitance has been deposited on the best AAO layer produced to fabricate a moisture sensor. The different sensors produced had been characterized versus humidity concentration and frequency in a climatic chamber. Depending on the AAO morphology parameters, the average sensitivity can be tuned from 0.8 pF/RH% to 9 pF/RH%.},

abstract={Just like the internet, Internet of things (IoT) with right standards and technologies, will impact multiple aspects of human lives including Smart Home, Smart Car and Healthcare. Healthcare of things (HoT) would enhance healthcare using the insight provided by sensor data. Healthcare users will subscribe to HoT services that use sensors to get activity data (such as steps walked, hours slept and so on) along with other health vitals (such as heart rate, temperature and weight) to improve user's health. Similarly Smart home users subscribe to a Smart home cloud service that will use data from home sensors. Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers. In this demonstration, we highlight how user experience perspectives impact the data framework design in MPMC environments, using our drops data framework infrastructure. We hope to have these concepts included IoT standardization efforts. This demonstration was also made at CES at the IEEE booth.},

To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals. Both these service assurance parameters will give more insight into the number of content/request arrivals that can be supported for a given service assurance requirement. In addition these service assurance parameters will be of help to design the system more effectively. We carry out a detailed ns2 based simulation to show impacts of various system parameters on the network performances for various QoS services designed for MQTT-SN system.},

abstract={There's a widely known need to revise current forms of healthcare provision. Of particular interest are sensing systems in the home, which have been central to several studies. This article presents an overview of this rapidly growing body of work, as well as the implications for machine learning, with an aim of uncovering the gap between the state of the art and the broad needs of healthcare services in ambient assisted living. Most approaches address specific healthcare concerns, which typically result in solutions that aren't able to support full-scale sensing and data analysis for a more generic healthcare service, but the approach in this article differs from seamlessly linking multimodel data-collecting infrastructure and data analytics together in an AAL platform. This article also outlines a multimodality sensor platform with heterogeneous network connectivity, which is under development in the sensor platform for healthcare in a residential environment (SPHERE) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC).},

abstract={The keystone of many applications associated to the vision of the Internet of Things is a distributed measurement and data acquisition system. Its design represents a major challenge, because it must enable concurrent measurement of different signals, with heterogeneous sensors and communication protocols. It must also be secure and scalable (in the sense of low marginal cost of adding new features and sensors). We propose the architecture of such a system and demonstrate two different use cases: a distributed system for electric power metering, and a wearable ECG monitoring system for multiple patients. We show that our proposed solution is flexible in terms of measured quantities, and can easily adapt to different data rates. In addition, it allows us to reach record performance in terms of energy consumption per effective number of quantization levels, as we demonstrate in the case of ECG sensors.},

abstract={Indoor localization is important for medical and industrial application as well as for wireless emergency and security systems. For such applications an accuracy within a few meters is desired. Available radio based systems within that accuracy are neither cost effective nor easy to deploy. In this work, we suggest an approach called bi-phase measurement based on phase measurements with two frequencies to determine the location of a tag. We design and build a complete indoor positioning system based on bi-phase measurements with easy to deploy and mobile wireless sensor nodes. The wireless sensor nodes form anchors and tags and communicate results to a location engine of the indoor positioning system. Our implementation comprises low-cost IEEE802.15.4 radio chips with built-in support for phase measurements unit for both, anchor and tags. We compute the position of the tag based on distance estimation retrieved with biphase measurements. We evaluate our indoor positioning system providing first measurement results for accuracy and precision and discuss trade-off between scalability and accuracy.},

abstract={This paper presents an important step forward towards increasing the independence of people with severe motor disabilities, by using brain-computer interfaces to harness the power of the Internet of Things. We analyze the stability of brain signals as end-users with motor disabilities progress from performing simple standard on-screen training tasks to interacting with real devices in the real world. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the concept of shared control-which interprets the user's commands in context-empowers users to perform rather complex tasks without a high workload. We present the results of nine end-users with motor disabilities who were able to complete navigation tasks with a telepresence robot successfully in a remote environment (in some cases in a different country) that they had never previously visited. Moreover, these end-users achieved similar levels of performance to a control group of 10 healthy users who were already familiar with the environment.},

abstract={The automatic interpreting of small object using computer in Remote Sensing Image(RSI) is sharply limited by low resolution and the uncertainty of imaging season, leading to the results of low recognition rate and poor generalization ability. In this paper, the Erlongshan Reservoir region of Heilongjiang province is selected as research area, and a secondary segmentation framework is proposed for small objects recognition based on salience detection and Hough Transform. Firstly, the salience of particular small objects is calculated to find candidates of small objects. Next, the Hough Transform is performed on an enhanced RSI constrained by the size of small size to identify small objects from others, such as highway fragment, river fragment, house and farmland and so on. The experiments results regarding small reservoir segmentation show that the method has high robustness and generalization ability, and the idea of classification can be used to the automatic interpreting process of other kind of small objects of RSI.},

abstract={Big data time series in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is now touted as a solution to help clinicians to diagnose the case of the physiological disorder and select proper treatment based on this diagnosis. Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) is one of the hemodynamic instabilities with high mortality rate that is frequent among many groups of patients. This study presented a methodology to predict AHE for ICU patients based on big data time series. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was used to calculate patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) time series and some features, which are bandwidth of the amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and power of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) were extracted. Then, the Genetic Programming (GP) is used to build the classification model for detection of AHE. The methodology was applied in the datasets of the 10th Physio Net and Computers Cardiology Challenge in 2009 and Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care (MIMIC-II). We achieve the accuracy of 83.33% in the training set and 91.89% in the testing set of the 2009 challenge's dataset, and the 83.37% in the training set and 80.64% in the testing set of the MIMIC-II dataset.},

abstract={It is reported that there are hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by seasonal flu all around the world every year. More other diseases such as chickenpox, malaria, etc. are also serious threat to people's physical and mental health. Therefore proper techniques for disease surveillance are highly demanded. Recently, social media analysis is regarded as an efficient way to achieve this goal, which is feasible since growing number of people post their health information to social media such as blogs, personal website, etc. Previous work on social media analysis mainly focused on English materials but hardly considered Chinese materials, which hinders the use of such technique for Chinese people. In this paper, we proposed a new method of Chinese social media analysis for disease surveillance. More specifically, we compared different kinds of methods in the process of classification, and then proposed a new way to process Chinese text data. The Chinese Sina micro-blog data collected from September to December 2013 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that a high classification precision of 87.49% in average is obtained. Comparing with the data from the authority, Chinese national influenza center, we can predict the outbreak time of flu 5 days earlier.},

To reduce the time needed for diagnosis the medical practitioners use system based approach. To help the practitioners researchers have developed various tools and techniques. In this paper the authors focus on classifications of subjects as diseased or not. Before doing classification the data has to be preprocessed. Preprocessing of data is done by applying techniques such as preparation of data, selection of attributes, balancing data, model evaluation and feature selection etc.The authors have collected the data of 466 subjects.

abstract={The machine-to-machine (M2M) communication network is a promising concept to improve the user experience. The M2M communication enables two M2M devices in proximity of each other to establish a direct local link and bypass the base station. Machine-to-machine communication can be applied to various important fields, such as military applications, public safety, environmental monitoring, commercial and social networking, and health and medical monitoring, ect. Hence the networks must exclude the faulty devices or faulty sensors to ensure the network Quality of Service (QoS). Fault detection is highly preferred on machine-to-machine communication networks. Device fault can be divided into two types: hard fault and soft fault. We will give a mechanism with capability to detect and distinguish soft fault devices. The simulation results indicate when a large number of machine-to-machine devices under a machine-to-machine communication network, the false alarm rate of the soft fault detection mechanism is close to 0% and the detection accuracy of it is close to 100%.},

abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},

This technology is anticipated to become an integral milestone in the development of smart homes and smart cities. For any technology to be successful and achieve widespread use, it needs to gain the trust of users by providing adequate security and privacy assurance. Despite the growing interest of the research community in IoT, and the emergence of several surveys and papers addressing its architecture and its elements, we are still lacking a thorough analysis of the security and privacy properties that are required for a system where the constituent devices vary in their capabilities. In this paper we provide a threat model based on use-cases of IoT, which can be used to determine where efforts should be invested in order to secure these systems. We conclude by recommending measures that will help in providing security and assuring privacy when using IoT.},

abstract={As the population is increasing worldwide, huge need arises to provide proper health-care services. With the advent of modern technologies the need-gap may be augmented. Sensor is one such technology which can be used to enable Internet of Things based health-care monitoring system. In this paper, implementation of such a system is described. In a real time health monitoring system, there are many sensors connected to a local data processing unit through a shared channel having a fixed bandwidth. These sensors have a wide variety of channel access requirements. The access to the channel should be discrete, so that each and every sensor avails the required bandwidth and delay in the shared channel. In this paper, a scheduling technique is proposed for the IoT based system, which nullify interference among different sensors and consequent distortation of precious health data. Implementation of this technique in our prototype health-care monitoring application is discussed in this paper.},

abstract={Received echo signals of transducer in ultrasound imaging have a high dynamic range of 12 bits and hence cannot be displayed on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors of ultrasound machine. Log compression is being used to compress the data to 8 bits. Since log compression is a non linear compression it is very difficult to trace the original characteristics of the signal. In this paper various global and local compression techniques were studied as a replacement for log compression so that the dynamic range of image can be retrieved if the physician has a better monitor for display, and also ensure minimum error in the retrieved signal leading to minimum error in retrieved image. From the results it is observed that Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of wavelet compressed image is 1.02 times more and that of gamma compressed image is 2.24 times more than log compressed image. Gamma based compression can be preferred to log and wavelet based compression, as it gives good quality image when compared with other compression techniques, but cannot be used to retrieve the statistical properties when expanded, since these statistical properties are helpful for doctors for better analysis. Wavelet based compression serves this purpose and hence is best suited for Internet of Things (IoT) enabled ultrasound system for remote diagnosis in the cloud.},

year={2015},

number={1},
pages={63-71},
abstract={Body area networks (BANs) consisting of small sensing and computing devices can help to improve medical care and well-being of humans. Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed-and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system.},

abstract={Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are intelligent wireless monitoring systems, consisting of wearable, and implantable computing devices on or in the human body. They are used to support a variety of personalized, advanced, and integrated applications in the field of medical, fitness, sports, military, and consumer electronics. In a WBAN, network longevity is a major challenge due to the limitation of the availability of energy supply in body nodes. Therefore, routing protocols can play a key role towards making such networks energy efficient. In this work, we exhibit that a routing protocol together with an effective body node coordinator (BNC) deployment strategy can influence the network lifetime eminently. Our initial work shows that the variation in the placement of a BNC within a WBAN could significantly vary the overall network lifetime. This motivated us to work on an effective node placement strategy for a BNC, within a WBAN; and thus we propose three different BNC placement algorithms considering different features of available energy efficient routing protocols in a WBAN. Our simulation results show that these algorithms along with an appropriate routing protocol can prolong the network lifetime by up to 47.45%.},

abstract={A motion-powered pulse generator using piezoelectric transduction is reported in this paper for wireless sensing devices. A metallic rolling ball is implemented in the prototype as an inertial proof mass excited by external motions at random low frequency. Taking advantage of the metallic proof mass, magnetic coupling can be achieved to actuate the piezoelectric cantilever by attaching tip magnets to the free end. In addition, self-synchronous switching is achieved by applying electrodes to the track of the rolling ball. A new passive prebiasing mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the pulse generator. Both simulation and experimental results were conducted to demonstrate the improvement. Experimental results show that 76% more energy can be extracted by the prebias mechanism compared to the unbiased case. A transmission circuit based on a Colpitts oscillator was built to test the performance of the capacitor-powered oscillator, which is designed as the load of the pulse generator. By adding a voltage control component, the transmission circuit is capable of encoding a sensor signal by frequency modulation, which demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a motion-powered wireless sensing prototype based on the piezoelectric pulse generator.},

Injection Flaws are serious software vulnerability, and are listed on The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. Injection flaws are introduced when the input data is supplied to the interpreter without proper security validation. Using Whitelist is an efficient input data validation strategy to avoid Injection Flaws attacks. In this paper, an improved object pool management method which provides properly validated input data as an object is proposed. Since pre-validated input, as a form of objects are managed through the object pool pattern, the object pool works as a white list and it helps prevent Injection Flaw attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that any performance degradation can be compensated by reduced object construction time, since objects in the object pool don't need construction.},

pages={475-480},
abstract={The US healthcare Affordable Care Act established the 30 day readmission protection program as one of the base lines of measuring quality of care at hospitals and post discharge. With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.},

abstract={Physical objects with embedded sensors are increasingly being networked together using wireless and internet technologies to form Internet of Things (IoT). However, early applications that rely on IoT data fail to provide comprehensive situational awareness. This often requires combining physical (i.e., IoT) data with social data created by humans on the Web and increasingly on their mobile phones (i.e., citizen sensing) as well as other data such as structured open data and background knowledge available on the Web (i.e., cyber data and knowledge). In this paper, we explore how integration and analysis of multimodal physical-cybersocial data can support advanced applications and enrich human experience. Specifically, we illustrate the complementary role played by sensor and social data, often intermediated by other Web based data and knowledge, using real-world examples in the domain of situational awareness, traffic monitoring, and healthcare. We also show how semantic techniques and technologies support critical data interoperability needs, advanced computation capabilities including reasoning, and significantly enhance our ability to exploit growing amount of data from the proliferation of Internet of Things.},

abstract={The increasing availability of connected Personal Health Devices (PHDs) enables a new type of information to be available in the Internet: health information. Most of these devices have specific ways to connect and share information to the Internet through gateways or health managers, creating vertical solutions where one device just talks to one health service. In this context, this paper proposes an architecture that considers the use of different types of health managers and gateways, but keeping interoperability by the use of widely adopted standards. The main contribution of this work is the distribution of health managers in different locations, such as mobile devices and cloud applications, enabling the use of a single health service for different types of PHDs. The ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is used as core technology, enabling the transport of PHD information over different technologies and protocols. We also present a new classification of health managers based on requirements of legacy m-health services. In conclusion, the results of the integration with a real cloud-based connected health system are presented and evaluated.},

abstract={While innovative e-Health and m-Health technologies and solutions will eventually change the way health and social care are delivered, it raises many challenges regarding what sort of ethical concerns need to be addressed in order to provide imperative regulations and guidance to healthcare professionals and developers. This paper discusses key ethical challenges identified as part of an ongoing research project funded under the European Commission's Future Internet-Private Public Partnership (FI-PPP) initiative. The Future Internet Social Technological Alignment Research project (FI-STAR) is concerned with the validation of Future Internet technology developed under earlier FI-PPP projects and involves seven early trials in the healthcare domain. The project is supported by 26 European partners with a further extension of 10 partners or so pending. The challenges discussed in this paper include ethical-legal frameworks, privacy and international harmonization. The suggestions discussed in this paper include an overarching e-Health ethical framework, an ethical impact assessment and an ethical matrix. The ethical matrix can be used as a tool to illuminate the diverse requirements among the seven uses cases and to narrow down potential strategies to address the ethical challenges.},

abstract={Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT), two very different technologies, are both already part of our life. Their massive adoption and use is expected to increase further, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately: their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the CloudIoT paradigm. To bridge this gap, in this paper we review the literature about the integration of Cloud and IoT. We start analyzing and discussing the need for integrating them, the challenges deriving from such integration, and how these issues have been tackled in literature. We then describe application scenarios that have been presented in literature, as well as platforms -- both commercial and open source -- and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues, main challenges and future directions in this promising field.},

abstract={Pervasive middleware systems are important for enabling the configuration and coordination of the services provided by devices in pervasive environments. PalCom is an example of such a system that aims to enable interaction among pervasive services over heterogeneous networks. In this paper we discuss the need for providing networking-media independent messaging among pervasive devices, and identify the problem of designing a media abstraction framework for a pervasive middleware. We identify a number of design principles and features that need to be satisfied by such a framework. The most important of these principles is the separation of networking protocol aspects into abstraction representations, which are exposed in a unified format to upper layers of PalCom, and communication mechanisms which are hidden by media-specific implementations of our proposed media-abstraction framework for PalCom. Also, we explain our implementation and evaluation of that framework.},

volume={},

pages={53-60},
abstract={In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.},

abstract={Internet of Things devices are envisioned to penetrate essentially all aspects of life, including homes and urban spaces, in use cases such as health care, assisted living, and smart cities. One often proposed solution for dealing with the massive amount of data collected by these devices and offering services on top of them is the federation of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. However, user acceptance of such systems is a critical factor that hinders the adoption of this promising approach due to severe privacy concerns. We present UPECSI, an approach for user-driven privacy enforcement for cloud-based services in the Internet of Things to address this critical factor. UPECSI enables enforcement of all privacy requirements of the user once her sensitive data leaves the border of her network, provides a novel approach for the integration of privacy functionality into the development process of cloud-based services, and offers the user an adaptable and transparent configuration of her privacy requirements. Hence, UPECSI demonstrates an approach for realizing user-accepted cloud services in the Internet of Things.},

abstract={Here a work in progress is reported on within research that aims to obtain knowledge about variables which may influence a hospital emergency department's performance and quality of service. Knowledge discovery will be achieved through the analysis of intensive data generated by the simulation of any possible scenario in the real system. The challenge is to provide knowledge of critical, non-usual or extreme situations. Simulation is the only way to obtain information about these kinds of situations, as it is not possible to test such scenarios in the real system. We show how simulation of the real system through advanced computing is a source of big data, as it allows rapid and massive data generation. The potential of high performance computing makes it possible to generate a very large amount of data within a reasonable time, store this data, then process and analyze it to obtain knowledge. We describe the methodology proposed for this goal, which is based on the use of the simulator as a sensor of the real system, and so as the main source of data. The application of data mining techniques will open the doors to knowledge. To verify that the proposed methodology works, we propose a case study in which the aim is to obtain knowledge from a set of data already available, obtained from the simulation of a reduced set of scenarios of the real system.},

abstract={Massive medical and health care data has been generated, asking for research and development of cloud storage system. In order to improve its scalability and reliability at the same time shorten user access time, the multiple data replica scheme should be adopted and the proper location for each replica should be determined. In this paper, a multiple data replica placement scheme for cloud storage under health-care IoT environment is proposed. It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica. We have implemented the proposed scheme based on CloudSim and have done performance evaluation. Simulation results have shown that it can not only improve user access time and promote load balance but also enhance system scalability and reliability.},

But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option. In this paper, a fuzzy assisted data gathering and alert scheme is proposed for healthcare services. Thus unnecessary waste of energy by transmission of unnecessary information is avoided. We have implemented it using Arduino and eHealth sensor kit.},

abstract={Social persuasion to influence the actions, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals, embedded in a social network, has been widely studied. It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.},

abstract={I-Health can be defined as “intelligent system and android, wireless communications technologies for health-care.” This emerging concept represents the evolution of I-Health systems from traditional desktop “telemedicine” platforms to wireless and mobile configurations. The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. This editorial paper presents a snapshot of recent developments in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the I-Health perspective. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these recent developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging concept.},

abstract={This paper provides a critical analysis of the impact of advanced technologies on our daily lives. It is contended that the integration of four key drivers (mobiles, data, sensors and social media) has a profound impact on society and human interaction on the social as well as the business scene. Whilst this impact has been intrusive, in that integration of these four key drivers eliminates the natural boundaries of privacy, it has also been beneficial in socioeconomic terms. These benefits are discussed from the perspective of the medical (mobile health) and business marketing (right time experiences) disciplines. Moreover, other business benefits from the use of these technologies have also been discussed in this paper. It is envisioned that this discursive paper will lead to an enlightenment within the continent and deepen the appreciation of integrative technologies. This paper asserts that these drivers, as stellar examples of best practice within the fields of medical and business marketing, can lead to similar innovations in other service industries.},

We will step out from typical current communication paradigm, to a much wider spectrum, where normal “things” will talk to each other, independent of human interaction. Emphasizing its importance in health industry, it can save lives and improve the ageing and disabled population's quality of living. It is not just things connected to the Internet - it is intelligent systems that we will be able to build on top of IoT that will introduce us to a better quality of life. However, IoT is facing a major problem: fragmentation and interoperability problems. If we want things to communicate with each other, intelligently and autonomously, then the new future Internet must be structured to allow such thing. The industry must adopt current standards and provide interoperability among other systems and developers must be aware of this issue too. Every new device should be IoT proof for future integration in IoT. In this article, there is a focus on these health-related use cases where they are detailed and explained how IoT could be deployed to aid in specific cases. The second part of the article takes the current IoT problem and tackles its issues, presenting a communication paradigm and proposes a new IoT system's architecture.},

abstract={Evolving from a mature body of research titled SoundScapes, this paper reports on a work-in-progress that is investigating the need that is evident for improved information and recommendation infrastructures to assist in healthcare intervention and communication (including apparatus and method). The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters. Through dissemination of the concept at this early phase of development in establishing the resource, an open invitation for peers and related interested parties to critique, advise, and otherwise contribute toward optimal development and wide impact - s offered.},

Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile. We will explore how these automotive trends translate to future challenges for technology platforms, integrated circuit module development, system-on-chip integration, design of safe systems, and implementation of secure but diagnosable systems.},

abstract={Multi-Sensory mobile health monitoring systems promise substantial improvements in the quality of healthcare. However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},

Transmission of data contributes to a significant amount of power consumption by the transmitter and increase in the network traffic. In this paper we propose a low complex rule engine based health care data acquisition and smart transmission system architecture, which uses IEEE 802.15.4 standard for transferring data to the gateway. The power consumed and the network traffic generated by the device can be reduced by event based transmission rather than continuous transmission of data. We developed two different rule engines: static rule engine and adaptive rule engine, which decides whether to transmit the collected data based on the important features extracted from the data, thereby achieving power saving. In this paper, ECG data acquisition and transmission architecture is considered. The metrics used for performance analysis are the amount of power saving and reduction in network traffic. It is shown that the proposed rule engine gives a significant reduction in energy consumption and network traffic generated.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare (U-healthcare) systems are expected to offer flexible and resilient high-end technological solutions enabling remote monitoring of patients health status in real-time and provisioning of feedback and remote actions by healthcare providers. In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},

A cooperative business ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. To support the ecosystem in practical technology and business development, ecosystem-driven standardization efforts, security mechanisms, terminal design principles, and data handling schemes are analyzed and corresponding solutions or guidelines are presented.

In addition, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS) is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demands for daily monitoring and on-site diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive medication management solution is proposed based on intelligent and interactive packaging (I2Pack) and intelligent medicine box (iMedBox). The intelligent pharmaceutical packaging is sealed by the Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by wireless communication. Various vital parameters can also be collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the wireless link. On-site diagnosis and prognosis of these vital parameters are supported by the high performance architecture. Additionally, friendly user interface is emphasized to ease the operation for the elderly, disabled, and patients. A prototyping system of the I2Pack and iMedBox is implemented and verified by field trials.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Electronic innovation is becoming increasingly more important in the evolution of our society. Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile. We will explore how these automotive trends translate to future challenges for technology platforms, integrated circuit module development, system-on-chip integration, design of safe systems, and implementation of secure but diagnosable systems.},

abstract={Cryptographic algorithms utilize finite-field arithmetic operations in their computations. Due to the constraints of the nodes which benefit from the security and privacy advantages of these algorithms in sensitive applications, these algorithms need to be lightweight. One of the well-known bases used in sensitive computations is dual basis (DB). In this brief, we present low-complexity superserial architectures for the DB multiplication over GF(2m). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a multiplier is proposed in the open literature. We have performed complexity analysis for the proposed lightweight architectures, and the results show that the hardware complexity of the proposed superserial multiplier is reduced compared with that of regular serial multipliers. This has been also confirmed through our application-specific integrated circuit hardware- and time-equivalent estimations. The proposed superserial architecture is a step forward toward efficient and lightweight cryptographic algorithms and is suitable for constrained implementations of cryptographic primitives in applications such as smart cards, handheld devices, life-critical wearable and implantable medical devices, and constrained nodes in the blooming notion of Internet of nano-Things.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is the network that connects everything with internet, through sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID), and global positioning systems and so on. The purpose of the IoT is to create a smart environment in which the basic information from any one of the networked autonomous actors can be efficiently shared with others in real-time. These factors cooperate to assist the treatment of many psychopaths including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. OCD is defined by a diverse group of symptoms that contain intrusive thoughts, rituals, preoccupations, and compulsions. In this paper, a strategy is applied to improve the behavior of the patients and also to help the therapists by the use of Internet of things technology. Therefore, intelligent things connected to the Internet get the information from the patients and send it to the database of the treatment center immediately. Furthermore, things warn the patients in the case of being overused.},

abstract={Integration of physical objects (or things) within the Web has become a goal for current and future health care systems. In this paper, we propose a new e-Health platform driven by the needs of integrated diabetes care management. Architecture of this platform that is designed to be consistent with the concepts of Web-of-Things (WoT) comprises a physical sensors layer linked to a health Web-portal layer via an existing network infrastructure. The physical layer incorporates wireless nodes; each of which comprises a set of medical sensors linked wirelessly to a humanoid robot. Unlike existing e-Health systems, the proposed system is designed to support self-management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) not only through remote data collection and monitoring of patients data, but also through offering a support platform for real-time decisions and long-term social and behavioral change. These support services are delivered to the patients over a distance through daily patient-robot interactions that are either automatically generated be the system or assigned by specialist physicians. A prototype e-health platform which incorporates all these healthcare attributes is designed, implemented, and its end-to-end functionality is tested successfully with the aid of NHS collaborators.},

In order to run this study we start establishing a classification of the use-cases and populate it with main scenarios used in healthcare. We found that despite a reasonably large taxonomy, applications use a low number of solutions with variations and add-ons. The main use-case is by far Remote Patient Monitoring that can be found together with some variations in the large majority of the studied scenarios and this is the use-case detailed below.

Here, we focus on demonstrating a “software to data” provisioning solution to propose a mapping of FI application use case requirements to software specifications (using GEs). The aim is to establish a provider to consumer cloud setting wherein no sensitive data will be exchanged but it will reside at the back-end site.

To show a real life scenario, we present the use case of the diabetes care and a FI application that includes various GEs.},

abstract={Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a crucial surgical procedure for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. There is yet no designated system for the accurate monitoring of the stimulating effect. Tremor is prominent in the Parkinson's disease. A novel wearable glove system for tremor quantification during DBS is presented. Rest, postural and action tremor assessment tasks are chosen as the feedback to the DBS treatment. Each tremor assessment task lasts for 10 seconds. A total of 5 patients with tremor were tested with the first prototype. Time-frequency analysis and statistical analysis were realized based on the inertial measurement unit signals. Results indicate that the tremor frequency was stable for all patients; however, the tremor amplitude fluctuated all the time. Valid state detection algorithm was performed for each assessment task. The mean tremor amplitudes of valid rest and postural tremor tasks correlate well with the clinical scores. After further experiments and verifications, this system is supposed to support the choosing of the optimal target location and stimulation intensity setting of the DBS electrode during DBS surgery.},

abstract={While wearable sensor systems are now widely used to monitor vital signs in hospitals and at home, most such systems are designed for bedridden patients. In contrast, the use of wireless sensors to capture physiological data from patients for long term health monitoring is becoming increasingly popular although some previous studies recorded complaints from users about discomfort when wearing these. In addition, these systems can sometimes suffer from interference from existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is both comfortable to use and does not encounter interference with existing wireless traffic is required. This paper presents a system design that includes a probe, sensor, radio, and receiver for a long term heart rate monitoring in a senior center. This system has been deployed in a senior center since May 2012, and 63 seniors have used this system in this period. The senior center has its own wireless network, and no changes were made to this. The monitoring system presented in this work runs together with the existing network, and achieves a 97% packet delivery rate.},

Although the CBT-I has proven efficacy, yet 32%-V89% of patients fail to consistently follow recommendations. The critical challenge of CBT-I is how to enhance the adherence of patients to therapy. In this study, we propose a persuasion method which integrates machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion for enhancing adherence, and we design a mobile application Win-Win ASleep (WWaS). We performed a 6-week study to evaluate the usability of WWaS on enhancing behavioral and recording adherence in comparison to a paper-based diary. Results show that machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion enhanced the adherence of patients in different manner, and WWaS assists users keeping a sleep diary accurate and complete. These higher quality records of sleep diary benefits the therapy. We also discuss strategies and provide recommendations for designing similar mobile applications to promote healthy behavior.},

The maliciousness of unknown file is calculated by attack tree model and Bayesian algorithm based on the file behaviors and sources. We count the security weights of file sources where users download or copy files, indicating the use habits and the safety consciousness. The assessment value of host security is finally obtained by knowledge repository update and dynamic machine learning, helping users to detect the behavior pattern and reinforce the host security. Experiments show that the accuracy of malware detection increases with the improvement of user's safety habits.

abstract={A novel design of analog front-end for detecting the neural signal is present in this paper. According to the traditional way with sigma delta ADC or pipelined ADC, this paper provides a new method to get better performance. The analog front-end contains low noise operational amplifier and SAR ADC which can be shared by multi channels. The design is verified in SMIC 0.18um CMOS process. The total current of 2 channels is only 2mA that is mainly cost by OPA. This circuit provides the new method to achieve ultra low power in Neural Signal Detection system.},

title={A Novel Method to Remove Eye-Blink Artifacts Based on Correlation Using ICA},
year={2013},
volume={},

pages={1946-1948},
abstract={In this study a novel method is proposed to automatically remove eye-blink artifacts from EEG signals. EEG signals were first decomposed into independent components (ICs) by independent component analysis (ICA). Using temporal correlation theory, the sum of the correlation values between each IC and the EEG signals at some special electrodes was calculated, respectively. Consequently, all the correlation values were sorted by descending order. The ICs which have significantly bigger correlation than the other ICs were picked to set as eye-blink artifact components, which were then set as zero to reconstruct clean EEG signals. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated on some contaminated EEG signals. The experimental results show that it is able to effectively remove eye-blink artifacts with little distortion of underlying brain signals.},

abstract={Long-term wireless neural recording systems which are subject to stringent power consumption, are highly desired to reduce the rate of data transmission and computation complexity. In this paper, we propose using a combination of on-chip neural action potentials ('spikes') detection system and compressive sensing (CS) techniques to reduce the power required for data transmission and a circulant and toeplitz matrix to reduce the computation complexity consequently further reduce the power consumption. We use the K-SVD algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations of spikes and iterative shrinkage thresholding (IST) algorithm to reconstruct them. Our results show that, using the data from simultaneously recorded from brain cortex of anesthetic SD-rats, the mean compression ratio is 60:1 achieved for 13.7-dB SNDR recovery using this mechanism.},

abstract={This paper presents a wearable physiological parameters monitoring device real time monitoring electrocardiograph (ECG), respiration, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, motion state and temperature continuously, online analysis and displaying the result in personal computer. Especially, Improved Pan-Tompkins Algorithm was embedded into wearable physiological parameters monitoring device to detect R peak, and further compute heart rate. Based upon the analysis of QRS frequency, the slope and the threshold decision, the improved algorithm can reliably recognize R peak of QRS complexes. Compared to the traditional Pan-Tompkins, there are three improvements. First one is accurately calculating heart rate even in a slow-moving state; another is wider sampling rate-500 and 1000 sampling rate or any other sampling rate; the last one is effectively avoiding the finite word-length effect during calculation in float type. The improved Pan-Tompkins algorithm makes ECG measurement more accurate and more flexible. Based on 20 volunteers' experimental tests, the fully-integration system with improved Pan-Tompkins Algorithm can accurately monitor the real-time R peak and other physiological indicators in a calm status, even in slow-moving status the system works well.},

abstract={Spikes detection is very important to the neural information study. However, the original neural signals collected by the microelectrode contain a lot of noise. Sometimes, spikes detection is hard to achieve when SNR (Signal to Noise Rate) is very low. At present, the fractal theory has been widely applied, and fractal dimension is very sensitive to fluctuation of curves. The fractal theory is introduced to the preprocessing of neural signals in this paper. It detected spikes by calculating fractal dimension of the original data. Experiments show that, fractal dimension can sign fluctuation of curve. This method can effectively detect the low amplitude spikes in the noise. The effect of spike detection based on fractal dimension is better than the usual threshold method and energy method.},

pages={47-65},
abstract={Communication and information access defines the basis to reach a personalized health end-to-end framework. Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem. This evaluates for the proposed protocol the data aggregation mechanism level, Round-Trip delay Time, impact of the distance, and the impact of the security. It has been concluded that secure continuous monitoring is feasible with the use of the proposed {YOAPY}} aggregation mechanisms and the capabilities from the proposed interconnection framework.},

Some medical IoT sensors translate and receive the massive data every time and on the other hand some equipment just translate emergency signal for help calling. All these communication process should be treated separately to keep the efficiency of ISM band utility. The system has three patterns: (1) Devices with various communication standard can sense the existing of other devices.(2) Device can change its working state depending on the priority of itself and others. (3) The system will only change the MAC and upper layer of Device network stack and without touching the PRY layer.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},

abstract={With the continuous development of brain imaging technology, it has become a hot area of neuroscience and information technology to research the human emotion changes, cognitive status and psychiatric disorders. In recent years, any smart device can be used as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things for information interaction. It will be the new research aspect for Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) to regard the human brain (the most intelligent “device”) as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things and to construct the network based on the human brains (we name it as Internet of Brains). In this paper, a model of wearable affective computing was proposed for discriminating different emotional states and constructing the Internet of Brains, by means of effective connectivity of EEG-based brain network. Firstly, we proposed a rational emotion-induced psychological experiment to collect the EEG data under different emotional states. Then, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to decompose different independent components based on different emotional states; Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was utilized to detect the interactive dependencies between each independent component in order to construct the causal connectivity brain network (CCBN); Dynamic characteristics, including causal density and causal flow of the CCBN, were extracted based on Graph Theory. Finally, the corresponding law between characteristics of EEG pattern and “inner” emotional state was discovered to establish affective computing model. Furthermore, the model of wearable affective computing was constructed based on above law with the portable EEG acquisition device, and prototype system of wearable affective computing based on Internet of Brains was achieved for BCI.},

abstract={In-home healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have big potential in business. To exploit this opportunity, an ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should aim for a cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform-based in-home healthcare station is proposed. The proposed methodology and solution are demonstrated in implemented prototype system and field trials.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={As we know cloud computing can be defined in many ways, but in simple terms "the cloud" can be called as a metaphor for the Internet, which is quite familiar cliche, but when it combined with "computing," the meaning gets bigger and fuzzier. Several analyst and service vendors define cloud computing as an updated version of Service oriented computing with virtualization: basically virtual servers available over the Internet. In this regard Charles Babcock definition of Cloud Computing serves very well which says, "one of the secrets of cloud computing is that cloud software reflects a new architecture that best exploits the clustered resources around it. It exploits them in such a way that one instance of the software potentially can serve hundreds or thousands of users, and a handful of instances can serve hundreds of thousands." Cloud Computing is needed to address the dynamic, exponentially growing demands for real-time, reliable data processing of 'Internet of Things' . The future of cloud computing services is heading towards offerings of flexible development and deployment environments. The cloud, with its vast elasticity and democratization of software access to end users, has created challenging software delivery problems like cost efficiency delivery, scalability, and the need for codification of critical operating workflows. If we remember middleware/infrastructure software has provided a common layer that acts as a single point of interest shared by IT network level operators and software developers. For example IIS, WebSphere, database servers, etc. typically provide a wealth of tooling to network folks in support of applications. Here cloud middleware system integrators may determine the future adoption of cloud computing. These systems normally support open platform stacks, provide generic interfaces between components, support infrastructure abstraction, and utilize standard communication frameworks. There are several proposed solution available wh- ch are known as Cloud Middleware such as Carbon 3.0, WS02, SaaSGrid, Sky Computing, Altocumulus etc. In this tutorial we would like to explore the future of cloud middleware and will discuss about what are the challenges ahead in cloud computing as well as cloud Integration. We will also take a look on some existing cloud middleware and see how they are helpful in cloud computing as well what are the future scopes for middleware in cloud computing.},

abstract={We established a regional cooperative emergency care system of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients based on the internet of things. In this article, the current status and problems of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patient emergency care have been studied and key influence factors are found. As the results, a shorter time from symptom onset to reperfusion is achieved with improved outcomes for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with STEMI significantly reduces mortality and morbidity, particularly when door-to-balloon (D2B) time is <; 90 min. An expedited pre-hospital diagnosis and transfer pathway was developed, with rapid reperfusion times and favorable outcomes.},

abstract={Recent vehicular networking activities include public vehicle to vehicle/infrastructure (V2X) large scale deployment, machine-to-machine (M2M) integration scenarios and more automotive applications. eHealth is about the use of the Internet to disseminate health related information, and is one of the promising Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Combining vehicular networking and eHealth to record and transmit a patient's vital signs is a special telemedicine application that helps hospital resident health professionals to optimally prepare the patient's admittance. From the automotive perspective, this is a typical Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication scenario. This proposal provides an IPv6 vehicular platform which integrates eHealth devices and allows sending captured health-related data to a Personal Health Record (PHR) application server in the IPv6 Internet. The collected data is viewed remotely by a doctor and supports a diagnostic decision. This paper introduces the integration of vehicular and eHealth testbeds, describes related work and presents a lightweight auto-configuration method based on a DHCPv6 extension to provide IPv6 connectivity for resource constrained devices.},

In this paper, we study privacy preserving data communication between patients and an online healthcare provider (referred to as vendor) for efficient remote healthcare monitoring (RHM) in a smart community environment. We adopt patients' attribute structures instead of their identities for authentication and preserve identity privacy during patient-to-vendor communication, and we build a receiver chain among smart homes to enable vendor-to-patient communication and achieve location privacy.

abstract={Embedded intelligence entails a vision of the Internet of Things oriented to "Ambient Intelligence", which can be defined as the capacity to collect and analyze the digital traces left by people when they interact with the environment and with such "intelligent things". In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},

abstract={In Europe, in a context of growing population and decreasing resources, ageing related diseases represent one of the most relevant challenges in terms of healthcare organization complexity, plus care levels and system financing balancing. Nowadays there are several researches that are studying the application of the IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm in the e-health field. This paper explains how a solution, built on the top of the VIRTUS IoT middleware, provides a valid alternative to current IoT solutions, which are mainly based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). VIRTUS leverage an Instant Messaging protocol (XMPP) to guarantee a (near) real-time, secure and reliable communication channel among heterogeneous devices. The presented development has been exploited in a healthcare case study: an implementation of a cost-savvy remote body movement monitoring system, aimed at classify daily patients' activities, designed as a modular architecture and deployed in a large scale scenario. The paper analyzes the features offered by the VIRTUS middleware, if used within a e-health solution, providing a comparison with other well-known systems.},

abstract={Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it is presenting a critical issue for knowledge mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents a knowledge acquisition and management platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is presenting the capability to connect any object to Internet. These Smart Objects are providing an enormous quantity of data. This work is focused on the personal and mobile health areas, where the integration of clinical devices in the patient's environment, this will enable new services with capabilities to predict health anomalies in real time, send alerts, reminders and offer an enriched feedback to the patient. This feedback will help and motivate to the patients with the treatments adherence and compliance and to follow a healthy lifestyle. In order to reach these services and feedback capabilities, it is required a full integration of the clinical devices and efficient processing of the collected data. The presented knowledge acquisition and management architecture is composed of, on the one hand, a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the integration of clinical devices, wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. On the other hand, it is complemented with a data model and pre-processing module called YOAPY, which analyses the data from the sensors at the personal devices level. This offers an enriched data to the knowledge-based systems, and this also aggregate the data acquired in order to improve the performance of the communications to the constrains from the Smart Objects in aspects such as low bandwidth, frame size and power consumption. This architecture is being evaluated with an extended set of sensors required for patients with breathing problem in the framework of the AIRE project, it has evaluated the capabilities to provide knowledge ac- uisition and management from continuous monitored vital signs, the capabilities for diagnosis and detection of anomalies, and finally the support for security and privacy.},

abstract={After the burst of the dot-com bubble in the Fall of 2001, the Internet has become a participative medium, which allows users to interact with one another and with the services from anywhere and at any time. The potential of such a change is still to be fully exploited, and phenomena such as social networks and cloud computing are just two of the many innovative solutions that have been born from the Web 2.0. At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality. Finally, we describe a typical HealthCare application for the IoT realized using WebIoT.},

abstract={The internet of things (IOT) has the same security requirements as traditional network, but according to the characteristics of its own, the internet of things also has some specific security features. Among these features, the flexibility of the network requires nodes to apply corresponding measures when scene changes. For example, in emergency situations (e.g. an accident occurs, and a doctor is needed), the location of the user is available, while under normal circumstances, the user's location information is confidential. This paper is in the background of the above scene to present an identity based system for personal location in emergency situations. The proposed system consists of registration subsystem, user authentication subsystem, policy subsystem and client subsystem. The system confirms the identity of the user through the user authentication subsystem and gets the level of the emergency through the policy subsystem. Then it can make sure that user's location information can be accessed only by some authorized user, and only when necessary. The proposed system strengthens the protection of the user's privacy while providing the location of the user, and prevents the disclosure of the users' information.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for multi-level segmentation, which could be used for a pre-process of non-sequential activity recognition, and could construct a high-level activity recognition using accelerometers on mobile phones. We extend single-level segmentation to multi-level by sweeping the temporal parameter. To confirm the validity of our approach. we pursued the experiment of gathering accelerometer data of real nursing in a hospital. After the experiment and multi-level segmentation, we confirmed several phenomena to imply the validity of multi-level segmentation such that sequence seems to be properly segmented fitting to the annotations transcribed from the voice, that there are peaks of lower-level segment boundaries without higher-level boundaries, and that higher-level boundaries are not lower-level boundaries.},

This paper proposed a new approach that build up a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis system by extracting information from textbooks. First of all, we design a semantic ontology which can achieve targeted and precise extraction by combining it with SVM classification and regular expression match. After the popularization of the ontology, data and information in the database can be correlated automatically. Moreover, aiming at the domain of TCM textbooks, a new symptom identification algorithm is adopted. Eventually, a structural knowledge database is constructed and the experiment system shows that our method can be useful to provide new services for digital library.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

It has considerable effects not only in terms of enhancing quality of life for patients, but also in reducing the financial burden on the health care system. The individualized weekly medicament blister for patients (7¿¿4 Box) from 7¿¿4 Pharma increases the compliance and helps to keep the health expenditures as low as possible. A potential extension of the 7¿¿4 Box could be a digital product memory which makes the imprinted data on the box electronically accessible in order to enable new innovative services which helps to increase the compliance. If we do not secure the data from an unauthorized access there is a possibility that third parties can read the data unperceived and on a grand scale.

year={2010},
volume={},

pages={809-812},
abstract={The incidence of serious and fatal Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR) and harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients in worldwide hospitals is extremely high. Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.},

abstract={In the last decade, the seminal term and concept of “m-health” were first defined and introduced in this transactions as “mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for healthcare.” Since that special section, the m-health concept has become one of the key technological domains that reflected the key advances in remote healthcare and e-health systems. The m-health is currently bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare delivery and technology sectors. From the wireless communications perspective, the current decade is expected to bring the introduction of new wireless standards and network systems with true mobile broadband and fast internet access healthcare services. These will be developed around what is currently called the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. In this editorial paper, we will introduce the new and novel concept of 4G health that represents the long-term evolution of m-health since the introduction of the concept in 2004. The special section also presents a snapshot of the recent advances in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the evolved m-health perspective. It will also present some of the concepts that can go beyond the traditional “m-health ecosystem” of the existing systems. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging healthcare delivery concept.},

abstract={Summary form only given. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},

abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},

abstract={The market sizes of each IoT application are relatively smaller than the PC and smartphone, although the development and production cost of the LSIs are becoming high. The LSI designers should find the ways to get funding of their development. One way is to get funding from providing system solution or service applications with expanding business models from supplying devices, as well as reducing the LSI costs and making the production volume larger. The pressure to expand the device supplying model depends on each application market, so such status of each application is to be discussed and also whether the expansion of the model is really necessary and practical or not.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain an- the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},
