abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage. The analyzed sensor data is sent back to the mobile application on the smartphone for real-time visualization if required.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as billions of devices and wirelessly connected systems will soon be adopting various IoT technologies and exchanging potentially sensitive information. IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities. Therefore, rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving environment. This paper presents different risks and security threats to the IoT, some security measures and solution models as well as a vulnerability assessment approach for the IoT in the healthcare sector.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.},

pages={398-406},
abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},

abstract={Lately, the advancement in circuit technology combined with the design of low cost embedded devices have resulted in an infiltration of the latter into everyday humans' lives. To exploit the full potential of ubiquitous embedded devices, a network is used for their inter-communication, offering advanced real-time monitoring. This paradigm, known as Internet of Things (IoT), is steadily consolidated and promises to offer a wide variety of applications. However, with the adoption of IoT, new challenges arise, such as the design of architectures able to support the requirements of the new applications. Towards this goal, we explore a three layered architecture, able to acquire, process and store Healthcare data as well as to provide real-time decision making. We use ECG signal arrhythmia detection as our use case evaluation scenario, and compare different techniques for wireless communication, storage and data classification. Experimental results show that, our architecture provides real-time decision making, with an average delay of 15 μs and that different communication technologies achieved to provide up to 10% lower power consumption on the monitoring devices. 1},

Governments encourage smart city initiatives to explore its applications. To determine knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare institutions toward IoT applications it is very important to objectively understand effects, to systematically summarize experiences, risks and barriers, to suggest market- oriented requirements, and to provide inspiration and reference for future smart city initiatives. Methods: We designed a KAP questionnaire about the IoT for healthcare and conducted a survey among municipal hospitals in Wuxi, China in May, 2015. Results: All respondents agreed on the definition of IoT for healthcare and easily obtained knowledge about the new IoT technology. Respondents showed positive views towards valuable functions and preferred solutions with inventory or material tracking, identification and authentication to make healthcare services more effective, convenient, and safe. We have stated that it is critical to solve security, privacy, and standardization issues. Last but not least, we have observed that governmental investments had played a guiding role and promoted IoT applications. Conclusions: The pilot survey has provided important insights into the KAP of IoT applications for healthcare institutions. In the near future, a KAP survey of IoT for healthcare in other cities in China and internationally will be conducted in order to gain further insights.},

abstract={Healthcare Internet of things (IoT) has been proposed as a promising means to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and access by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while prevent unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system which supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},

abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback. This data, which pertains to bicortical drilling conditions, will provide teaching surgeons and their surgical residents evaluation tools beyond those currently available.},

abstract={Advances in information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). In the healthcare environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to physicians and patients as they can be applied to various medical areas (such as constant real-time monitoring, patient information management, medical emergency management, blood information management, and health management). The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment. In this paper, we discuss the security requirements of RFID authentication schemes, and in particular, we present a review of ECC-based RFID authentication schemes in terms of performance and security. Although most of them cannot satisfy all security requirements and have satisfactory performance, we found that there are three recently proposed ECC-based authentication schemes suitable for the healthcare environment in terms of their performance and security.},

abstract={In an environment that is only now addressing the security issues of medical devices as a constituent part of IT networks, a new wave of technological development is threatening to swamp healthcare. The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery. Making security the enabler of safe and protected data transfer, exchange, and use, is fundamental to using this technology.},

abstract={Applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare have been widely forecast, investigated, and even deployed on a small scale. But most of this work is scattered about a few random applications. In this paper we present a structured approach for describing IoTs for healthcare by defining general classes of system types, classifying the healthcare delivery settings, then using a structured approach to describing the elements for a particular use case. We illustrate the approach for three use cases and discuss certain issues that arise. A brief survey of related work is also given. We conclude that for healthcare applications, domain understanding and inter-professional collaboration are critical to developing realistic use cases.},

title={Session Resumption-Based End-to-End Security for Healthcare Internet-of-Things},
year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={581-588},
abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},

abstract={Internet of Things technology provides a competent and structured approach to improve health and wellbeing of mankind. One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism. Our experimental results reveal that fog computing helps achieving more than 90% bandwidth efficiency and offering low-latency real time response at the edge of the network.},

abstract={The current trend of population growth demands a more flexible and readily available healthcare services compared to traditional centralized approach. Mobile and wearable devices that have sensing and Internet access capabilities offer the opportunity of changing how medical services are delivered to the patients. The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology. The protocol stacks of the edge router and router are validated through successful connectivity tests and packet drop tests. The single-hop communication latency is also measured to give an indication of the overheads introduced by the stack.},

abstract={Health is the fundamental capability humans require to perceive, feel, and act effectively, and as such, it represents a primary element in the development of the individual, but also of the environment humans belongs to. That is why it is necessary to provide adequate ways and means to ensure the appropriate healthcare delivery based on parameters monitoring and direct providing of the medical assistance. The new technologies development and implementation, especially the Internet and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), enable global approach to the health care system infrastructure development. This leads to e-health system that, in real time manner, supplies a valuable set of information relevant to all of the stakeholders (patients, medical and paramedical stuff, and health insurance) regardless their current location. Commercial systems in this area usually do not meet the general patient needs, and those that do are usually economically unacceptable due to the high operational and development costs. In this paper, based on well-known low-cost technologies, there is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solution for a sustainable and adaptable patient oriented infrastructure development, presented.},

abstract={There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system energy efficiency, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.},

abstract={I-Health can be defined as “intelligent system and android, wireless communications technologies for health-care.” This emerging concept represents the evolution of I-Health systems from traditional desktop “telemedicine” platforms to wireless and mobile configurations. The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems.

pages={529-534},
abstract={In-home healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have big potential in business. To exploit this opportunity, an ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should aim for a cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform-based in-home healthcare station is proposed. The proposed methodology and solution are demonstrated in implemented prototype system and field trials.},

With cooperative wireless communication, the wireless node entities can increase their effective quality of service (QoS) via cooperation. In developing countries the death rates due to lack of timely available medical treatments are quite high as compared to other developed countries.

year={2017},
volume={PP},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Facial expressions are among behavioral signs of pain that can be employed as an entry point to develop an automatic human pain assessment tool. Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the Intensive Care Unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a bio-sensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real-time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system act as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application. In summary, this study proposes a scalable IoT system for real-time biopotential monitoring and a wearable solution for automatic pain assessment via facial expressions.},

abstract={We present here new types of self-powered, low-interference wireless sensors based on graphene circuits, which can have dual functions: chemical sensing at the molecular level and radio-frequency (RF) modulation. We demonstrate that a fully passive, graphene-based harmonic (transponder) sensor can display a chemically sensitive frequency multiplication effect, which, when linked to a hybrid-fed small antenna, can realize an ultrasensitive, low-profile, light-weight, and potentially flexible RF sensor. We have designed two different types of circuits comprising back-gate graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and compared in detail their performance and implementation complexity. We have also proposed a reliable readout method based on the machine learning for extracting the mean value and the fluctuation of chemical doping levels in GFETs. The proposed graphene-based harmonic sensor may potentially benefit a wide range of sensing applications, including, but not limited to, power-efficient, real-time monitoring of chemical/gas exposures and biological agents, as well as emerging wearable and implantable devices.},

abstract={With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose a- innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting. The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.},

abstract={In recent years, the research in generic Internet of Things (IoT) attracts a lot of practical applications including smart home, smart city, smart grid, industrial Internet, connected healthcare, smart retail, smart supply chain and smart farming. The hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN) is a special kind of the generic IoT network, which is composed of the different nodes, such as the gateway node, cluster head nodes, and sensing nodes organized in a hierarchy. In HIoTN, there is a need, where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password, and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely accepted real-or-random model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. UAKMP offers several functionality features including offline sensing node registration, freely password and biometric update facility, user anonymity, and sensing node anonymity compared to other related existing schemes. In addition, UAKMP is also comparable in computation and communication costs as compared to other existing schemes.},

Data integrity in healthcare is of utmost importance. A compromised transmitted or received signal can pose serious health hazards to patients. With the growing number of devices connected to the Internet, serious security concerns have been raised in relation to lack of appropriate security mechanisms used in Internet of Things devices. While security considerations are not recent in the arena of Information Technology, many existing frameworks developed for Internet of Things (IoT)healthcare present new and unique security challenges. In order to address these challenges and ensure a maximum level of security in IoT products and services, a lightweight and reliable framework has been developed which uses a combination of universally unique identifier, timestamp and a self-learning battery depletion monitor to detect and mitigate replay attacks on battery dependent IoT devices. A prototype application has been developed to successfully test the framework.},

abstract={Analysis of foot plantar pressure distribution is an important factor considered today in the field of healthcare as well as in sports world. Lower body physical rehabilitation therapies are associated with sports world. To avoid long-term damage to the affected part and to accelerate the recovery period, it is necessary to keep an eye on the patient regularly following his/her rehabilitation activities not only in the hospital but also at home. Multiple techniques have been developed for quantitative gait analysis but comparatively these systematic process fails as it measures static or dynamic process for very short duration of time and space. In the proposed system, an electronic insole system is designed in a shoe using force sensing resistor (FSR) sensor that monitors pressure wirelessly, thus saving the information in an array of sensor network for transferring data into CPU. Thus considering the information available used for further study purpose. Four sensors are placed, one at the heel, one at the lateral part, one at the metatarsal head and one at the anterior. The plantar pressure is used to analyse pressure distribution. The signal from the pressure sensor will be processed by microcontroller and sent to mobile via Bluetooth module. With the help of Internet-of-Things (IoT), when the signal goes beyond the limit the notification will be sent to patient consulting the doctors/physiotherapist so that immediate action can be carried out further. The proposed system will help the doctors/physiotherapist as well as person to monitor his health using smart shoe.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a competent and structured approach to handle service deliverance aspects of healthcare in terms of mobile health and remote patient monitoring. IoT generates an unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud computing. But for real-time remote health monitoring applications, the delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient’s real-time data at Fog Layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index (THI) of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed BBN classifier based model has high accuracy and response time in determining the state of an event when compared with other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

abstract={The interaction between technology and healthcare has a long history. However, recent years have witnessed the rapid growth and adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the advent of miniature wearable biosensors, and research advances in Big Data techniques for effective manipulation of large, multiscale, multimodal, distributed and heterogeneous data sets. These advances have generated new opportunities for personalized precision eHealth and mHealth services. IoT heralds a paradigm shift in the healthcare horizon by providing many advantages, including availability and accessibility, ability to personalize and tailor content, and cost-effective delivery. Although IoT eHealth has vastly expanded the possibilities to fulfill a number of existing healthcare needs, many challenges must still be addressed in order to develop consistent, suitable, safe, flexible and power-efficient systems that are suitable fit for medical needs. To enable this transformation, it is necessary for a large number of significant technological advancements in the hardware and software communities to come together. This keynote paper addresses all these important aspects of novel IoT technologies for smart healthcare-wearable sensors, body area sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and Big Data analytics. It identifies new perspectives and highlights compelling research issues and challenges such as scalability, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, and security, with various case studies. In addition, with the help of examples, we show how knowledge from CAD areas such as large scale analysis and optimization techniques can be applied to the important problems of eHealth.},

abstract={Research trends in Internet of Things (IoT) in health care show its potential to improve quality of health care. It helps to enable preventive care and promote automation to reduce the risk of human error. In Indonesia, mother and child health care is still an important agenda of the government because the maternal and child mortality rate is still high. This paper describes a preliminary design of IoT applications for supporting mother and child healthcare program. We reviewed government regulations and guidelines to determine the needs and used them as a starting point. Then we defined the networks (topology, architectures, and platform), service and application, security and technology used in the design. This multi-platform system design constitutes portable medical devices with multiple sensors for collecting medical data and sending them to server. A mobile application works as mobile gateway for the devices and as a portal for accessing context-aware personalized information related to patient's condition. It also works as communication tool for teleconsultation. All of these functionalities are supported by service applications in a cloud so that patients and caregivers can access them from anywhere at anytime. This system is designed to enable remote monitoring and early detection by medical specialist and physicians at the clinic for mother and child preventive care.},

abstract={Diagnosis, and monitoring of health is a very important task in healthcare industry. Due to time constraint, people are not visiting hospitals, which might and possibly lead to a lot of health issues in one instant of time. Predominantly most of the healthcare systems have been developed to predict and diagnose the health of the patients by which people who are busy in their schedule can also monitor their health at regular intervals. Many studies show that early prediction is the best way to cure health because early diagnosis will help and alert the patients to know the health status. Healthcare being a global issue more particularly India being a most populated nation where majority of which live in villages deprived of healthcare facilities on real time basis continuously and regularly. With the increasing use of technology, there is an urgent need to have such a smart health monitoring system that can communicate between network devices and application which will help the patients and doctors to monitor, track and record the patient's sensitive data containing medical information. This paper depicts the idea of solving health issues using the latest technology, Internet of Things (IoT). It presents the architectural review of smart healthcare system using Internet of Things(IoT) which is aimed to provide a Better HealthCare to everyone. Using this system architecture, patient's body parameters can be measured in real time. Sensors collect patients body parameters and transfers that data to Microcontroller ATMEL 89s52 which further transfer that data to the MySQL database server. This MySQL database server manages the data and provides accessibility. The patient can view this data with the help of Android App. Which one can install in Smartphone, or Tablet. If data is abnormal then patient gets notification also care takers will get emergency message. With the help of different decision making algorithms decisions can be made easily and fast and according to - t people can have access to the database. The patient can check their medical record Hence, the system provides a Better HealthCare to everyone and error free and smooth communication to patients.},

abstract={As a new research area, Digital Forensics is a subject in a rapidly developing society. Cyber Security for Big Data in the Cloud is getting more attention than ever. A computing breach requires digital forensics to seize digital evidence to determine who is responsible and what has been done maliciously and the possible further consequences. In particular, for Big Data attack cases, Digital Forensics is facing even more challenge for earlier digital breach investigations. For the PPI (Protection of Personal Information) a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law has been launched to be implemented from the 25th May 2018. This compulsory regulation will have an important impact on healthcare PPI in the cloud (ICO, 2017, Deloitte, 2014). Nowadays, Big Data with the characteristics of three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and Variety), are either synchronized with the Cloud, or stored in the Cloud, in order to solve the storage capacity and so on problems, which made Digital Forensics investigation even more difficult. The Big Data Digital Forensics issue for the Cloud is difficult. One of them is the need to identify which physical devices have been compromised. Data are distributed in the Cloud, so the customer or digital forensics practitioner cannot have full access control like the traditional investigation does. Smart City are making use of ICT (information communications technology) to collect, detect, analyze and integrate the key information data of core systems in running the cities. Meanwhile, the Control Centre is making intelligent responses to different requirements that include daily livelihood, PPI security, environmental protection, public safety, industrial and commercial activities and city services. The Smart City healthcare Big Data are collected and gathered by the IoT (Internet of Things) (Liu, 2014, Qi, 2016) and applying GDPR prevent Cyberstalking and Cybercrimes. This paper summerises our review on the trend- of Digital Forensics used for Big Data. The evidence acquisition challenge is discussed. A case study of a Smart City project with IoT services collecting Big Data which are stored in the Cloud computing environment is represented. The techniques can be generalised to other Big Data in the Cloud environment.},

abstract={Devices used in Internet of Things (IoT) technology are interconnected through internet and continuously send data for storage in disparate databases and files. This poses heterogeneity in data syntax and semantics. In the past few years, researches have been carried out to handle these problems in various information systems such as water and healthcare by applying semantic and syntactic uniformity. This research presents an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework to sustain the interoperability between stakeholders within an information system by applying Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) paradigm and ontology. The major contribution of this research is building software model which is annotated with semantic model to maintain the comprehension between the modelers and the programmers allowing sustainability by adapting to the changing environment. Moreover, the framework offers two types of semantic validation i.e. model and data of the documents to integrate sensor data which we claim as a novelty in this study. The validated IoT data is integrated through RESTful web service interface of SensorThings API. The aim of this paper is to apply the methodology of the framework, on IoT based healthcare system, that has been successful in water information system.},

Such system will provide ubiquitous capabilities to various applications, including manufacturing transportation and health care. The aim of this paper is to provide real-time context-aware healthcare services to elderly patients. The proposed solution is context-aware by identifying health condition and tracking patients in a real-time manner. It can extract this context information from wearable sensors and iBeacons, and by employing ontological based semantic meaning appropriate action can also be taken. In critical medical conditions the system can send alert notifications to nearest rescue medics or emergency centers including patient location. The system utilizes the iBeacons that are more simple, accurate, low-cost and energy efficient than existing technologies. The system is actually ontology base engine, which gets the information through sensors, identify the symptoms and classify them into normal and critical categories using naive Bayes classifier. Thus provide real-time and context-award health care services to its users.},

abstract={With the evolution and development of the 5th generation (5G) technology, Internet of Things (IoT) within 5G provides a foundation and opportunity for smart home and smart healthcare. However, these scenarios will critically rely on the large-scale deployed sensors that constantly transmit streaming data to cloud platform for real-time estimation, which brings the issue of privacy disclosure since smart devices will gather kinds of data including personal sensitive information. Meanwhile, there is not some universal method to solve privacy problem in 5G because of diversified security needs for different applications. In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter based differentially private steaming data share scheme is proposed to protect user privacy for cloud platform in IoT. The proposed method can ensure that released data will not compromise individual privacy, and improve the utility of released data simultaneously. The proposed scheme is evaluated by four real-world datasets and compared with the results of utility optimization scheme based on Kalman filter. Experiments show that the proposed scheme enhances the utility of released streaming data under the premise of effective privacy preserving and achieve better practicability and validity.},

abstract={Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the us- rs and the system, are demonstrated.},

abstract={Smart Healthcare is envisioned as the combination of traditional healthcare augmented by smart bio-sensors, wearable devices and a plethora of on-body sensors that communicate with smart hospitals, smart emergency response systems, and ambulances, through advanced information and communication technologies. The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. The present paper address some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a Secure Digital Camera (SDC) integrated with the Secure Better Portable Graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this work is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection: concurrent encryption and watermarking which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management (DRM). The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: (1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image, and (2) frequency domain watermarking using block-wise DCT of size 8×8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant incre- se of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.},

abstract={Now a days, modeling and developing smart places is an open research problem. The concept of smart city can be observed in every field of life including smart parking, banking, sewerage, waste management, smart transport, environmental monitoring and healthcare centers. Internet of things (IoT) is an implementation of smart nodes that sense the data, interpret, process and give response within a required time in a network. The ability to embed sensing devices into real environment enables the transformation of smart environment. However, there is a very little practical use of IoT infrastructure in real life. Many traditional approaches are proposed by researchers that do not address this issue correctly. We have focused on the smart sewerage system of a smart city in this paper. The sewerage system is represented by a graph in which a junction is assumed as a node and flow of water is represented as a directed edge in the graph theory. The flow of water is controlled by defining a safe path from one junction to another by predicting behavior of water and safe state of the system. The graph based model is transformed into a formal model using Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL). The proof of correctness is provided by using various facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel design of an Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine based health monitoring system-The Smart Chair. Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities. The results presented show that the proposed system is definitely a low cost affordable solution for IoT based telemedicine system, as compared to existing systems.},

Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. In other words, the focus of this Blue Skies piece is to analyze the research challenges involved with developing a new class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are “resource and data aware”, and which are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data and data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models and data availability while executing – trading accuracy for execution time, etc.},

Generally, CPS and Internet of Things (IoT) have the same basic architecture, whereas the former shows a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements, i.e., wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be a vital part of CPS applications. With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},

abstract={With the development of network-enabled sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms, various human-centered smart systems are proposed to provide services with higher quality, such as smart healthcare, affective interaction and autonomous driving, etc. Considering cognitive computing is an indispensable technology to develop these smart systems, this paper proposes human-centered computing assisted by cognitive computing and cloud computing. First, we provide a comprehensive investigation of cognitive computing , including its evolution from knowledge discovery, cognitive science and big data. Then, the system architecture of cognitive computing is proposed, which consists of three critical technologies, i.e., networking (e.g., Internet of Things), analytics (e.g., reinforcement learning and deep learning), and cloud computing.

abstract={Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in various domains, which are home, agricultural, healthcare, tourism, transportation and education. The more of its development, the more we need to consider about its security and privacy issues. In this paper, we consider smart home system (SHS) as a case study. SHS is an integration of home appliances together with sensors to get automatic operations of heating, lighting, air conditioning, home security, health care systems, etc. Moreover, SHS allows homeowner to monitor and perform appliances functions remotely at any instant time via the Internet. Due to the widespread availability and proliferation of the SHS, attackers can impersonate as a homeowner to steal important data (e.g., vital signs) for doing extortion and life threatening. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach of private Blockchain implementation for SHS to cope of its privacy and security issues. We review Ethereum Blockchain packages for SHS according to its smart contract features for handling access control policy, data storage and data flow management.},

abstract={With the advent of Internet of Things, remote patient monitoring and diagnosis is becoming the more advanced and accessible feature in healthcare industry regardless of age and disorder. With the increase in patient population, remotely prioritizing and diagnosing patients becomes a major problem. Research has been conducted to address this issue. However, many models fail to support the condition of comorbidity. In this paper, we developed a multi-task machine learning model that supports remote patient prioritization based on disease severity. This model not only considers patients diagnosed with a single disease, but also acknowledges comorbidity of a patient to calculate their severity utilizing physiological data. Classifying a comorbid patient based on their disease(s) severity is a challenging task. We achieve this by exploiting the commonalities and differences between the diseases using multi-task machine learning. Based on the correlation between diseases, we classify the patient into appropriate severity level. In addition to this, our model also supports continuous patient monitoring based on their severity levels, which is made possible by implementing in Apache Spark. Apache Spark also serves as a real-time streaming processor suitable for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis.},

abstract={Future Internet of Things (IoT) networks are expected to support a massive number of heterogeneous devices/sensors in diverse applications ranging from eHealthcare to industrial control systems. In highly-dense deployment scenarios such as industrial IoT systems, providing reliable communication links with low-latency becomes challenging due to the involved system delay including data acquisition and processing latencies at the edge-side of IoT networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a priority-based channel access and data aggregation scheme at the Cluster Head (CH) to reduce channel access and queuing delays in a clustered industrial IoT network. First, a prioritized channel access mechanism is developed by assigning different Medium Access Control (MAC) layer attributes to the packets coming from two types of IoT nodes, namely, high-priority and low-priority nodes, based on the application-specific information provided from the cloud-center. Subsequently, a preemptive M/G/1 queuing model is employed by using separate low-priority and high- priority queues before sending aggregated data to the Cloud. Our results show that the proposed priority-based method significantly improves the system latency and reliability as compared to the non-prioritized scheme.},

abstract={Internet of things as a concept uses wireless sensor networks that have limitations in power, storage, and delay when processing and sending data to the cloud. Fog computing as an extension of cloud services to the edge of the network reduces latency and traffic, so it is very useful in healthcare, wearables, intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. Scheduling is the NP-hard issues in fog computing. Edge devices due to proximity to sensors and clouds are capable of processing power and are beneficial for resource management algorithms. We present a knapsack-based scheduling optimized by symbiotic organisms search that is simulated in iFogsim as a standard simulator for fog computing. The results show improvements in the energy consumption by 18%, total network usage by 1.17%, execution cost by 15%, and sensor lifetime by 5% in our scheduling method are better than the FCFS (First Come First Served) and knapsack algorithms.},

To date, extensive research been made in above-mentioned areas, which is frequently named Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Recently, the term of Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging, which emphasizes the interconnection of all available resources both physical and virtual with the purpose of collecting and exchanging data. Thus, IoT technologies have been widely adopted for the gathering of health related resources to provide reliable and effective healthcare services especially to elderly and people with chronic diseases. Thereby, the aim of this paper is to present a brief overview of IoT enabled AAL systems and application particularly in the healthcare domain, and then identify the existing challenges and future research opportunities in this field.},

abstract={The authentication models are utilized among the various network based applications, between various homogeneous and heterogeneous network appliances, Internet of things (IoT) applications, Healthcare applications, etc. The authentication models relies upon the encryption models for the protection of data during the propagation of the keys over the communication media. A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm. The proposed model has been undergone various experimental scenarios, where it has been found improved than the existing model in the terms of bit difference, overall time and average time.},

abstract={Lately, Internet-based solutions, brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computation and storage technologies, have been driving revolutionary approaches in innumerable domains, including the sensitive domain of healthcare. Indicatively, real-time diagnosis of medical issues, telemedicine, remote monitoring of patients, as well as computer-assisted smart transportation in case of emergencies, are anticipated as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) that can execute several applications of different criticality, thus necessitating mission-critical and non-critical peripheral components. Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system. The main cricalities anticipated in such systems are described, as well as open areas for future research are also identified.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},

So, to handle these challenges, in this paper, an SDN-enabled multi-attribute secure communication model for IIoT environment is designed.

abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},

abstract={The world of medical science is an emerging area that has accelerated with new technologies and this is the time when the vision of “The internet of things (IoT)” has turned into reality. IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors. The readings are shown in the form of graphs at IBM Watson IoT platform.},

abstract={The constant rapid growth and development of modern medical technology has resulted in an ever-growing demand for higher quality health monitoring systems. This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is the prelude to new technological innovation. It expands with different applications such as smart home, smart city, smart grids, smart car, smart healthcare and smart retail. The application of IoT in Healthcare system brings high value for the elderly, victims of chronic disease and those who require constant supervision. But there are many security issues in such application. Moreover, the medical devices used in the IoT enabled Healthcare System are resource constrained devices. So, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for authenticating such resource constrained medical devices. New algorithm for secure authentication and key agreement of the medical devices is also presented. This mechanism is resistance against various security attacks such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and Denial of Service attacks. Formal security analysis and the comparative study presented in this paper have proved that the proposed mechanism has many security features and highly secure among the already existing authentication mechanisms.},

abstract={The Internet of Things promises tremendous benefits in our everyday life where healthcare is one of the application areas in which IoT has also paved its way for the development of human assistance technologies. With smart sensing and remote monitoring, peoples' health conditions can be assessed more effectively but to provide IoT services such as depressive disorder assistance still, there are many challenges to overcome. A huge number of connected heterogeneous devices and enormous amounts of data generated by these devices are not only difficult to manage but providing services with them in a dynamic IoT environment, count for significant efforts. There is a requirement for mechanisms that not only cater the heterogeneity of IoT devices but also provide dynamic services efficiently based on user requirements. Web of Objects (WoO) platform enables IoT services by virtualizing real world objects using semantic ontology. It provides a base for the development of interoperable microservices which support dynamic features by utilizing streams of sensory data. This paper proposes a Microservices Model in WoO based IoT platform to provide services for depressive disorder assistance. In addition, a Real World Knowledge (RWK) model of user situations and emotions has also been developed.},

Information and communication security is of utmost important as medical devices or sensors deployed to monitor and collect personal medical data are highly vulnerable to malicious hacker attacks. Moreover, compliance with industry standards and government regulations mandate security and privacy protection of health and medical information.

abstract={Advances in multimedia technologies have led to the emergence of smart home applications. In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants’ activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcaremonitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes. Our proposed methodology models activities based on spatially recognized actions, with every activity expected to have a direct relationship with a specific set of locations. Furthermore, the proposed technique validates the assignment of labels based on the temporal relations among consecutive actions. We performed experiments to evaluate our proposed methodology on CASAS datasets, which indicated that the proposed methodology achieved better performance, to a statistically significant extent, than state-of-the-art methodologies presented in the literature.},

abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in communication technologies have enabled homes, cars even whole cities to be network connected. However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can be considered as a promising solution for detecting, reporting emergency events, eliminating the hoax calls and responding swiftly saving lives.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is emerging as one of the popular technologies influencing every aspect of human life. The IoT devices equipped with sensors are changing every domain of the world to become smarter. In particular, the majorly benifited service sectors are agriculture, industries, healthcare, control & automation, retail & logistics, and power & energy. The data generated in these areas is massive requiring bigger storage and stronger compute. On the other hand, the IoT devices are limited in processing and storage capabilities and can not store and process the sensed data locally. Hence, there is a dire need to integrate these devices with the external data sources for effective utilisation and assessment of the collected data. Several existing well-known message exchange protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are applicable in IoT communications. However, a thorough study is required to understand their impact and suitability in IoT scenario for the exchange of information between external data sources and IoT devices. In this paper, we designed and implemented an application layer framework to test and understand the behavior of these protocols and conducted the experiments on a realistic test bed using wired, wifi and 2/3/4G networks. The results revealed that MQTT and AMQP perform well on wired and wireless connections whereas CoAP performs consistently well and is less network dependent. On the lossy networks, CoAP generates low traffic as compared to MQTT and AMQP. The low memory footprint of MQTT and CoAP has made them a better choice over AMQP.},

abstract={The revolutionary trend of the up-to-date medicine can be formulated as wide introduction into basic medicine fields of electronic (e-health) and mobile (m-health) healthcare services and information applications. Unfortunately, all list of qualified m/e-healthcare services can be provided cost-effectively only in urban areas very good covered by broadband 4G/5G wireless communications. Unacceptably high investments are required into deployment of the optic core infrastructure for ubiquitous wide covering of sparsely populated rural, remote, and difficult for access (RRD) areas using the recent (4G) and forthcoming (5G) broadband radio access (RAN) centralized techniques, characterized by short cells ranges, because their profitability boundary exceeds several hundred residents per square km. Furthermore, the unprecedented requirements and new features of the forthcoming Internet of Things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M), and many other machine type IT-systems lead to a breakthrough in designing extremely green, flexible, and cost-effective technologies for future 5G wireless systems which will be able to reach in real time the performance extremums, tradeoff optimums and fundamental limits. This paper examines the 5G PHY-MAC fundamentals and extremely approaches to creation of the profitable ubiquitous remote e/m-health services and telemedicine as the main innovation technology of popular healthcare and other social e-Applications for RRD territories. Proposed approaches lean on summarizing and develop the results of our previous works on RRD-adapted profitable ubiquitous green 4G/5G wireless multifunctional technologies.},

abstract={Many digital healthcare services now follow the cybermedicine approach. The Internet is used to deliver such services as medical consultations, diagnosis, and prescriptions. Mobile services provide end-users (patients) with online and personalized access to consultations and treatment with other end-users (medical professionals). Services become social, taking into account the activity of patients and their collaborative work (in participation with medical professionals and other interested parties). In this paper, we discuss the opportunities that Internet of Things (IoT) provides to the cybermedicine development. Parkinson's disease (PD) serves as a case study, which we use to motivate the effective IoT use for human involvement into healthcare processes such as disease progress prevention, therapy, people mutual support, and social patient rehabilitation. We define several research problems for developing new models, algorithms, and methods within overlapping domains of healthcare, data engineering, and IoT technology.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the healthcare by providing high-quality services, lowering the costs, and increasing the efficiency of management by allowing the physical objects to integrate with computer systems to collect the sensed data and process as per the need. Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario. Finally, the paper concludes with the reported results.},

abstract={As the number of devices (things) connected to the Internet (Internet of things: IoT) is growing, achieving robust security and privacy (S&P) is becoming increasingly challenging. With the heavy use of medical things (MT), the S&P in the medical domain poses a serious issue that continues to grow. Due to the criticality and sensitivity of the data in the healthcare domain, ensuring the S&P of the Internet of medical things (IoMT) makes matters even more problematic. Lack of proper S&P in IoMT will not only leave patients' privacy at risk but may also put patients' lives at risk. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the S&P issues of IoMT. We also provide an approach to quantify IoMT risks and demonstrate how to assess risks in two IoMT devices. This work aims to increase the S&P awareness among IoMT stakeholders by enabling them to identify and quantify potential IoMT S&P risks.},

Development of wireless sensor networking area has greatly increased the feasibility of a mobile e-health system since it provides wireless communication technology with promising sensor network applications. However, mobile e-health is subjected to a lot of security attacks such as sensor node cloning attack and man-in-the-middle attack. A secure e-health authentication system is one of the important approaches in order to provide high security for the whole e-health monitoring system. Considering the potential security attacks in mobile e-health application, a development of a unique identity of the e-health sensor node is proposed to provide a highly secure authentication protocol in mobile e-health. The identity of the e-health sensor node is a very important element in the proposed authentication protocol to ensure the confidentiality and the authenticity of transmitted e-health data.},

abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services towards 5G.},

The incremental patient data will be captured in real time and sent to the cloud/data center asynchronously to be analyzed and stored. Cloud based medical advice, then, can be provided to ensure accessibility of patient's data from anywhere and via almost any computing devices. The system will also be able to follow the progress of patient's recovery and determine if further care is necessary.

As a result, discovering the desirable services has become very challenging. In this paper, we aim to address the IoT service discovery problem and investigate the existing solutions to tackle this problem in many aspects, therefore we present a new and full comparative study of the most representative (or outstanding) service discovery approaches in the literature over four perspectives: (1) the IoT service description model, (2) the mechanism of IoT service discovery, (3) the adopted architecture and (4) the context awareness. After each of these perspectives, we discuss the existing solutions as well as the main challenges that face the service discovery issue in the IoT domain. Besides, we adopt a classification of the IoT service discovery approaches based on their mechanism of discovery, and we propose a set of requirements that need to be considered when defining an IoT service in the IoT domain.},

abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end to end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSN), to incorporating the internet of things (IoT), to communication links, to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise is of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and the future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level towards the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision - aking regarding their PHI/EHR. A lot of work and effort is necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/ pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},

abstract={Internet-of-things can allow healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients by analyzing the sensors outputs with big data analytics. Sleeping conditions are one of the most influential factors on health. However, the literature lacks of the appropriate simulation tools to widely support the research on the recognition of sleeping postures. The current work proposes an agent-based simulation framework to simulate sleeper movements on a simulated smart bed with load sensors. This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors. This simulator can also generate logs text files with big data for applying offline big data techniques on them. The current approach is illustrated with an algorithm that properly recognized the simulated sleeping postures with an average accuracy of 98%. This accuracy is higher than the one reported by an existing alternative work in this area.},

abstract={Presently Internet of things is one of the hottest topics right now in information field of technology. Internet is now not only to connect people but also used to connect one device to another. This connection of day to day things is internet of things. In this paper it will be seen how Internet of things can be used in hospitals and health care centers. Healthcare system in past was merely based on the decisions made by the doctor on the basis of domain knowledge, the patients symptoms and the reports which come through diagnosis. What if with the help of Internet of things the doctor can constantly monitor the patient or can monitor the environment around the patient using sensors. The Internet of Things permits objects to be detected and controlled remotely crosswise over existing system foundation. The Internet of things is empowered by the most recent improvements in RFID, smart sensors and communication tech. The present development in Internet and device-to-device advancements can be viewed as the main stage of the Internet of things.},

It has the ability to provide both mainstream as well as the value added services in almost all the sectors. Healthcare is an important service sector for overall development. It has far reaching implications in the quality of living. In the modern world where the quality of living has been degraded significantly IoT can certainly play a constructive role in providing better services. In healthcare, there are several occasions such as patient health monitoring, remote observation and emergency proceedings outside the hospital where sensors can play essential roles. The coordinated sensor networks can provide even better services. IoT has the ability to provide all these coordinated services. Narrowband IoT (NBIoT) is an economical and simpler version of IoT which can handle these tasks effectively. Due to the widespread requirement of healthcare, NBIoT is a preferred solution as it needs fewer amounts of resources.

IOT devices gather and share information directly with each other and the cloud making it possible to collect, record and analyze data streams faster and more accurately. Healthcare management is one of the most promising applications of Information Technology. In the existing system patient is monitored using bedside monitoring station with wired sensors, which makes the patients to be periodically monitored by doctors/nurses. It is impossible to collect data for wider range and coverage of wireless network is not available. This paper proposes a cooperative approach for an automated Healthcare Monitoring System which uses sensors to measure various parameters of the patient like temperature, pulse and body movement using wireless communications. The patient's status will be recorded and stored on the cloud. This proposed system process the sensor data and provides a real time monitoring information about physiological conditions of a patient to the doctor, so that the Healthcare professionals can monitor and access patient's data from anywhere of the world at any time.

abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered a- d relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},

abstract={The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (loT) is quickly becoming the key enabler for the digital transformation of the healthcare industry by offering comprehensive improvements in patient engagements, productivity and risk mitigation. This paradigm shift, while bringing numerous benefits and new opportunities to healthcare organizations, has raised a lot of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.},

abstract={Anomaly detection is important for time-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as healthcare and emergency management. The recent introduction of Fog computing architecture provides an efficient platform for delay sensitive IoT applications. Exploiting the advantages of Fog computing for anomaly detection provides the ability to detect abnormal patterns in an accurate and timely manner. Use of Centralized and Distributed anomaly detection methods suffer from significant latency and energy consumption issues. Hence, we propose a novel anomaly detection method, called Fog-Empowered anomaly detection, by harnessing the processing power of the Fog computing platform and using an efficient hyperellipsoidal clustering algorithm. The end nodes in the Fog computing architecture do not perform any processing or clustering on the data. The Fog layer and the Cloud layer nodes perform the clustering and anomaly detection process, thus helping to achieve anomaly detection in a timely manner. The evaluation using synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach achieves a significant reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to the Distributed and Centralized schemes, while achieving a comparable detection accuracy compared to a Centralized scheme.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Cognitive networks (CNs) are one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where CNs will play an important role in the future internet in several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based Internet of Things (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.},

abstract={In recent years, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has already been implemented in numerous application domains, such as smart city, intelligent healthcare assistant, and smart transportation management. Researchers or developers associated with these domains frequently require diverse types of IoT devices to implement or test their IoT related innovations. However, building an IoT-testbed by purchasing these IoT devices in every few months is infeasible considering that most of them will be used only for a small amount of time and will become obsolete with the arrival of an upgraded version of those devices. Instead, a better approach would be rented out the IoT devices in on-demand, just-in-time, and pay for only the time the devices are used basis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose IoTbed - an architecture to deliver a large scale Testbed as a service using the IoT devices located in the users' proximal networks. IoTbed enables testbed providers to build their testbeds in the edge of the network and allows easy and secure access for IoT service providers to run experiments on those testbeds. IoTbed presents an economic model that offers monetary incentives to the device owners for using their devices in the testbed experiments. We posit that such an incentive model will encourage more testbed providers to rent out their smart devices through IoTbed. To demonstrate the feasibility of IoTbed, we implemented a prototype of IoTbed to run on Contiki powered IoT devices and evaluated the performance.},

Such services could supplement the shortage of staff in primary healthcare centers thereby reducing the burden on healthcare service providers. The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients.

A challenge however is when "dumb" terminals are employed for the data streaming process, it is difficult to determine the originating source. This makes it even harder to match personal data from incoming devices. This paper proposes a traceability route formation using a network graph based on techniques such as tuple of inputs and the Büchi automaton. This enabled the work to provide proper trace routes for the personal data from the originating source to the destination, which can be a health information system (HIS). The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove the feasibility of the proposed work.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) changes many sectors of our lives. In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes. The system is flexible and can incorporate more policy rules, professionals, and data classes.},

pages={342-349},
abstract={Data-driven business processes are gaining popularity among enterprises now-a-days. In many situations, multiple parties would share data towards a common goal if it were possible to simultaneously protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations described in the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics require parties to transfer their raw data to a trusted mediator, who then performs the desired analysis on the global data, and shares the results with the parties. Unfortunately, such a solution does not fit many applications where privacy is a strong concern such as healthcare, finance and the internet-of-things. Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy, in this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving multi-party analytics, where the goal is to enable analytics on multi-party data without compromising the data privacy of each individual party. We propose a secure gradient descent algorithm that enables analytics on data that is arbitrarily partitioned among multiple parties. The proposed algorithm is generic and applies to a wide class of machine learning problems. We demonstrate our solution for a popular use-case (i.e., regression), and evaluate the performance of the proposed secure solution in terms of accuracy, latency and communication cost. We also perform a scalability analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution as the data size and the number of parties increase.},

Mainly, wearable devices are going to have a large impact on our lifestyle, especially in a healthcare scenario. In this framework, it is fundamental to secure exchanged information between these devices. Among other factors, it is important to take into account the link between a wearable device and a smart unit (e.g., smartphone). This connection is generally obtained via specific wireless protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): the main topic of this work is to analyse the security of this communication link.

pages={16441-16458},
abstract={In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm.},

In this paper we focus on the exploitation of IoT platforms for remote healthcare status monitoring within the context of the so called connected health applications. In this context users and most importantly healthcare service providers and first responders may have remote access to sensor data collected from devices attached to persons with special needs or under monitoring. The efficient interconnection of medical sensors, aggregation of data towards distant datacenters and backend services requires the implementation of appropriate protocol stacks.

abstract={Different application domains are challenging the still immature access control mechanisms currently used to authenticate and to authorize system-on-chip architectures to services deployed locally or in the cloud. These domains include Internet of Things, Smart Places or Industry 4.0 where different kinds of devices and objects, often poorly physically protected, low-cost and energy-constrained, interact with different kinds of services through lightweight communication protocols. These protocols usually guarantee basic data confidentiality and integrity, securing communication channels using cryptography, but there are still important challenges related to authentication and authorization. This work proposes a new system-to-service authentication and authorization mechanism based on the combination of a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and two tokens (one devoted to authentication and the other devoted to authorization), capable of working over HTTP or COAP relying on federated schemes and adapted to the specific requirements of this kind of environments. The new mechanism is validated and its efficiency and security are evaluated using a real healthcare case study.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly developing field and has the potential to significantly impact the healthcare industry. However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.},

Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.},

abstract={Regarded as one of the future enabling technologies of the Internet of Things at the biological and nanoscale domains, Molecular Communication (MC) promises to enable applications in healthcare, environmental protection, and bioremediation, amongst others. Since MC is directly inspired by communication processes in biological cells, the engineering of biological circuits through cells' genetic code manipulation, which enables access to the cells' information processing abilities, is a candidate technology for the future realization of MC components. In this paper, inspired by previous research on channel coding schemes for MC and biological circuits for cell communications, a joint encoder and modulator design is proposed for the transmission of cellular information through signaling molecules. In particular, the information encoding and modulation are based on a binary parity check scheme, and they are implemented by interconnecting biological circuit components based on gene expression and mass action reactions. Each component is mathematically modeled and tuned according to the desired output. The implementation of the biological circuit in a simulation environment is then presented along with the corresponding numerical results, which validate the proposed design by showing agreement with an ideal encoding and modulator scheme.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},

abstract={The Internet is populated with billions of electronic gadgets that have become a part of our fabric. Internet of Things is gaining popularity in at most all applications from smart buildings, intelligent transportation, healthcare and defence. IoT is a many vision one paradigm technology. One of the many visions of IoT is to make `Things' social. Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a young paradigm that integrates IoT and Social networking principles where Things are not only autonomous and smarter but also socially conscious. The authors propose a trust management scheme to facilitate trustworthy automatic decision making based on behaviour of objects. The authors use SIoT Trust metrics namely direct trust, centrality, community interest, Cooperativeness, Service Score to compute Trustworthiness among objects. The Expected trust and periodic trust updates evidently identify the presence of `on off' selective forwarding attacks. The authors demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme with other existing trust management schemes in the literature.},

abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as sensors have been actively used in 'fogs' to provide critical data during e.g., disaster response scenarios or in-home healthcare. Since IoT devices typically operate in resource-constrained computing environments at the network-edge, data transfer performance to the cloud as well as end-to-end security have to be robust and customizable. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a middleware featuring "intermittent" and "flexible" end-to-end security for cloud-fog communications. Intermittent security copes with unreliable network connections, and flexibility is achieved through security configurations that are tailored to application needs. Our experiment results show how our middleware that leverages static pre-shared keys forms a promising solution for delivering light-weight, fast and resource-aware security for a variety of IoT-based applications.},

abstract={The spry maturation of Internet of Things (IoT) has paved way to the rapid development of numerous sectors and these have been envisioned in; connected transport, smart cities, connected homes, connected healthcare, etc. IoT is a technology that connects "things" that are embedded with sensors, actuators and network connectivity to collect and exchange the data to the internet. The ability of IoT that offers distinct technologies for a small constrained device to collect and deliver messages across sophisticated networks leaves room for more exploration. Zeroing down to the healthcare sector, a couple of Personal Health Devices (PHDs) have been developed to collect and share information across the internet. One Machine to Machine (oneM2M), ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD are some of the healthcare standards that have been developed have been developed to deal with the issue of interoperability in the IoT. In this paper we design and implement an interoperable messaging system that is based on international standards for IoT healthcare services. Standard IoT protocols; Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are some of the protocols that were designed to be used in an IoT environment. We designed and implemented a message system using CoAP following international standards for IoT healthcare services. This is due to better performance that CoAP offers in a constrained environment over other protocols. The paper further analyses and evaluates a comparative performance of number of packets transmitted in a transaction and packet loss rate number during transmission between the designed system and existing messaging system that uses MQTT.},

abstract={We are witnessing a technological revolution with a broad impact ranging from daily life (e.g., personalized medicine and education) to industry (e.g., data-driven healthcare, commerce, agriculture, and mining). At the core of this transformation lies "data". This transformation is facilitated by embedded devices, collectively known as Internet of Things (IoT), which produce real-time feeds of sensor data which are collected and processed to produce a dynamic physical model used for optimized real-time decision making. At the infrastructure level, there is a need to develop a scalable architecture for processing massive volumes of present and historical data at an unprecedented velocity to support the IoT paradigm. To cope with such extreme scale, we argue for the need to revisit the hardware and software co-design landscape in light of two key technological advancements. First is the virtualization of computation and storage over highly distributed data centers spanning across continents. Second is the emergence of a variety of specialized hardware accelerators that complement traditional general-purpose processors. Further efforts are required to unify these two trends in order to harness the power of big data. In this paper, we present a formulation and characterization of the hardware acceleration landscape geared towards real-time analytics in the cloud. Our goal is to assist both researchers and practitioners navigating the newly revived field of software and hardware co-design for building next generation distributed systems. We further present a case study to explore software and hardware interplay for designing distributed real-time stream processing.},

In the low energy form, we have narrowband IoT (NBIoT). It is preferred in healthcare sector due to its low energy requirements. There are several proposals for the implementation of NBIoT in the healthcare sector. NBIoT has been standardized and it has perfect compatibility with cellular platforms such as LTE. Therefore in the recent times, NBIoT is a good choice for healthcare related applications. However, the security measures and other system related challenges are the biggest threats for NBIoT. If these issues and challenges are handled properly it can be one of the most suitable and popular choices for the low power wide area implementations of healthcare.

abstract={Wearable Internet-of-Things (WIoT) environments have demonstrated great potential in a broad range of applications in healthcare and well-being. Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements. We conclude the paper with a list of insights into what capabilities constrained WIoT platforms should provide developers so as to make the inclusion of data-driven security primitives in such systems.},

abstract={Recent hardware developments have made it possible for the Internet of Things (IoT) to be built. A wide variety of industry sectors, including manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, transportation, and healthcare are actively seeking to incorporate IoT technologies in their operations. The increased connectivity and data sharing that give IoT systems their advantages also increase their vulnerability to attack. In this study, the authors explore the automated generation of attacks using genetic programming (GP), so that defences can be tested objectively in advance of deployment. In the authors' system, the GP-generated attackers targeted publish-subscribe communications within a wireless sensor networks that was protected by an artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS) taken from the literature. The GP attackers successfully suppressed more legitimate messages than the hand-coded attack used originally to test the IDS, whilst reducing the likelihood of detection. Based on the results, it was possible to reconfigure the IDS to improve its performance. Whilst the experiments were focussed on establishing a proof-of-principle rather than a turnkey solution, they indicate that GP-generated attackers have the potential to improve the protection of systems with large attack surfaces, in a way that is complementary to traditional testing and certification.},

Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results.

abstract={The internet of things (IoT), which is known as one of the key enabling technologies of smart cities, generally refers to the network of smart objects, which are embedded with sensing, computing, networking, and actuating capabilities that all together enable them to collect and exchange data. The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules. Experimental results have shown that the RealAlert scheme can accurately assess the trust of the sensor nodes as well as data in IoT.},

IoT applications retrieve sensing data from the cloud for analysis and decision-making purposes. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the sensing data is essential for the correctness and safety of IoT applications. We summarize the new challenges of the IoT data communication framework with authenticity and integrity and argue that existing solutions cannot be easily adopted. We present two solutions, called Dynamic Tree Chaining (DTC) and Geometric Star Chaining (GSC) that provide authenticity, integrity, sampling uniformity, system efficiency, and application flexibility to IoT data communication. Extensive simulations and prototype emulation experiments driven by real IoT data show that the proposed system is more efficient than alternative solutions in terms of time and space.},

IoT will have an important role in connecting almost everything (mobile devices, cameras, home appliances, healthcare devices, military equipments, ..., etc) to the Internet via different communication technologies such as Wi-Fi. This connection will have impact on many sectors of our life such as industry, economy, social life, and ICT sector. Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT.

abstract={The advances in IT sector, cloud computing, the wide usage of sensors and mobile devices, and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) made our world looks like a small town. These rapid developments keep us connected all the day and seven days a week. Also, the IoT enables the connection of the devices around us (including different sensors) to the internet via different wireless and wired communication technologies. These networked sensors can be used to collect different types of data from different applications (healthcare, agriculture, civil and social life) and send it for processing and extraction of appropriate decisions. The mobile cloud computing technology is an efficient solution to process different types of collected data and respond with the required answer in real time situations where the quick response is very important. In this paper, we build a multipurpose integrated sensors system. This integrated system consists of networked sensors for different purposes and applications. For example, the sensors can be health sensors to measure the pulse and blood pressure of patients, or it can be sensors to measure the temperature to indicate a fire accident. The networked sensors will transfer the sensed data through wireless technologies to a Cloud for processing and notifying the listed users to take the proper action.},

abstract={The recent proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and wearable devices has given rise to crowdsourcing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure threefactor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card, 2) password and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Burrows- Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. With the combination of high security and appreciably low communication and computational overheads, our scheme is very much practical for battery limited devices for the healthcare applications as compared to other existing related schemes.},

abstract={The next era of computing is the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities with development of the Internet of Simulation (IoS). The existing technologies of Cloud, Edge, and Fog computing as well as HPC being applied to the domains of Big Data and deep learning are not adequate to handle the scale and complexity of the systems required to facilitate a fully integrated and automated smart city. This integration of existing systems will create an explosion of data streams at a scale not yet experienced. The additional data can be combined with simulations as services (SIMaaS) to provide a shared model of reality across all integrated systems, things, devices, and individuals within the city. There are also numerous challenges in managing the security and safety of the integrated systems. This paper presents an overview of the existing state-of-the-art in automating, augmenting, and integrating systems across the domains of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, energy efficiency, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, and healthcare.

This paper proposes a decentralized ontology based system architecture that caters to a healthcare organization's privacy needs as well as its enterprise security policy concerns considering futuristic IoT and Electronic Health Records (EHR) trends in healthcare. To identify privacy infringements and organizational policy violations across the institution, our proposed HealthCare Security and Privacy (HCSP) ontology is utilized in conjunction with three agent-level filters: the Exception Creation Agent (ECA), the Policy Mapping Agent (PMA), and the Privacy Assurance Filter (PAF).

abstract={Our world and our lives are changing in many ways. Communication, networking, and computing technologies are among the most influential enablers that shape our lives today. Digital data and connected worlds of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.},

abstract={Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global healthcare system. A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},

abstract={Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses. To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard.},

abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},

Existing IoT architectures are highly centralized and heavily rely on a back-end core network for all decision-making processes.

abstract={Routing plays an important role in the overall architecture of the Internet of Things. IETF has standardized the RPL routing protocol to provide the interoperability for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). LLNs cover a wide scope of applications, such as building automation, industrial control, healthcare, and so on. LLNs applications require reliable and energy-efficient routing support. Point-to-point (P2P) communication is a fundamental requirement of many LLNs applications. However, traditional routing protocols usually propagate throughout the whole network to discover a reliable P2P route, which requires large amount energy consumption. Again, it is challenging to achieve both reliability and energy-efficiency simultaneously, especially for LLNs. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient region-based routing protocol (ER-RPL), which achieves energy-efficient data delivery without compromising reliability. In contrast of traditional routing protocols where all nodes are required for route discovery, the proposed scheme only requires a subset of nodes to do the job, which is the key of energy saving. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies demonstrate that ER-RPL has a great performance superiority over two conventional benchmark protocols, i.e., RPL and P2P-RPL.},

abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where WSNs will play an important role in future internet by several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel data compression and transmission scheme for power reduction in Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled wireless sensors. In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) systems are becoming multidisciplinary day by day and integrating more and more mechanical, electrical, electronics, control and information disciplines. This integration is making mechatronics systems based on IoT easily available for public uses. Government organisations, different industries, healthcare systems and individual users are using these systems to store different kind of public, private, confidential and classified information. This is attracting cyber attackers to make cyber and cyber physical attacks to these systems. Currently, security policy researchers of both industries and academic institutes are analysing existing cyber attacks and are developing different types of techniques to protect the systems against potential cyber-threats and cyber attacks. This paper analyses the increasing exploitation of IoT based mechatronics system, which has created more opportunities for the current cybercrimes. Contemporary and important mitigation approaches for cyber-crimes have also been articulated in this paper.},

abstract={In recent decades the aging of the population has led to a change in the health held with special attention to the issue of home care and e-health. The aim is to provide different types of health care services to the patient's home rather than in hospital so improving the quality of life of patients by allowing them to stay in their own home environment. The healthcare sector is undergoing profound transformation thanks to the possibilities offered by the Internet of Things and new technologies, the mobile and wearable. The new model is oriented to the overall health of the patient, stimulated and implemented through a strong pro activities of the patient and realized using mobile devices and multi-channel technology. The idea is to introduce a set of functionalities in order to support the family or the patient, to act independently or to support existing treatments coaching systems. With this aim the paper proposes an architecture, based on a cognitive model, to realize a coaching system for daily living activities which relies on solving a problem as an human so modeling human cognition.

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks comprise tiny devices with limited processing power and tight energy restrictions. These limitations make it difficult to use established security mechanisms protecting the devices against malicious attacks. This holds particularly for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that help to detect various net-based attacks but often demand significant network and computing resources. In this article, we design and evaluate some IDS mechanisms for IoT Networks that are suited to small devices. They use a trust management mechanism that allows devices to manage reputation information about their neighbors. This mechanism makes it possible to single out maliciously behaving units in a processing and energy-friendly way. The approach is explained in the context of the healthcare domain.},

abstract={Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency nowadays. Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.},

abstract={Many Technology experts consider Internet of things as major step for the future endeavors that are going to happen in computer network field. According to CISCO, IoT can be considered as a situation or time where more things are connected to internet than human beings. Things represent the physical objects which are provided with unique identification numbers and their purpose is to collect and transmit the data which are relevant to the scenario in which things are placed. From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification. In RFID system, proper authentication has to be performed between RFID tags and RFID reader. In this paper describes a authentication scheme which performs authentication between RFID tag and RFID reader with help of a server which contains some pre shared information about tag and reader.},

abstract={Studies show that the poor hand hygiene practices in public health institutions such as hospitals, clinics, schools and nursing homes is the most likely cause of the spread of various bacterial diseases. Proper hand hygiene is the single biggest defense against spread of diseases and therefore the caregivers' compliance with hand hygiene is one of the most effective tools in preventing Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) in such institutions. In this paper, we present a system prototype of interconnected hand-hygiene stations that use a combination Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies for monitoring the hand hygiene compliance rate. The cloud-connected hand hygiene stations can cooperate to detect hand hygiene events in real-time, and help measuring the hand hygiene compliance at large-scale health-care facilities where it is deployed. The presented work is an initial phase of an on-going research study on hand hygiene compliance. Further phases of the system are currently being developed. The proposed system is desired to be scalable, and easy to install so that it can overcome most of the problems of existing related systems.},

pages={648-653},
abstract={Sensors are important components in the Internet of Things (IoT) that encompass a wide spectrum of applications from healthcare to monitoring critical infrastructure. Securely gathering sensor measurements by adopting traditional cryptographic mechanisms is fraught with vulnerabilities emanating from the inability to safeguard secrets on edge devices, often in adversarial environments, where appropriate hardware protection logic and power consumption overheads are counterproductive to the desire to keep the devices low cost and long lasting. This paper continues recent efforts into investigating an alternative secure sensing approach with the potential to provide a solution for resource-restricted IoT devices. In particular, we investigate the possibility to exploit unreliability of a physical unclonable function (PUF) resulting from its sensitivity to variations in supply voltage conditions to guarantee the veracity of physical measurements from potentially any transducer capable of converting a physical phenomenon to a voltage signal. Therefore we present an approach that has the potential to realize a universal PUF sensor where the PUF itself acts as a sensor or is integrated with a sensor. Thus, for a PUF sensor, cryptographic processes and sensing are inseparable. Further, we rely on a dominant external condition-voltage-responsible for unreliability to secure sensing. We validate the feasibility of the proposed universal PUF sensor approach based on experimental data extracted from RO-PUFs (Ring Oscillator PUFs).},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled information system solutions are emerging in various domains such as remote healthcare, smart logistics, agriculture and so on. Meanwhile, Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) have proved themselves to be promising tools for driving and managing devices within IoT systems. However, past works have not fully addressed how the IoT-based BPMS can continue their execution when the involved IoT devices do not have a reliable Internet connection. In this paper, we propose a system design for decentralised device-to-device (D2D)-based BP execution, where mobile nodes have the capability of both executing BPs but also migrating BP execution to other nodes during runtime. We apply this design to the field of smart logistics, in order to enable smart goods monitoring. The presented goods monitoring solution enables reacting to events as soon as they occur, while also generating a trace of the monitoring execution history. A prototype focusing on the migration functionality of the platform has been implemented and tested to evaluate its performance in the context of the mentioned smart logistics scenario.},

abstract={Recently, big data analytics has received important attention in a variety of application domains including business, finance, space science, healthcare, telecommunication and Internet of Things (IoT). Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.},

abstract={New prospects for health care monitoring is engendered by the augmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big data, as well as the ubiquitous nature of tiny wearable bio sensors. Many confront have yet to be addressed to create a dependable and flexible system for health care monitoring. In this paper Big data analytics on IoT based Health care system is proposed. IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework. Since the response time of the proposed system is less, it is suitable for real time alerting.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the physical devices that are embedded with Internet, electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity. This includes many different systems, for instance, healthcare, wellbeing, smart home, building, smart meters, and so on. The Internet-based technical architecture, IP-based communication protocols, and technologies are facilitating the exchange of smart object services over the insecure channels, therefore, security and privacy of the involved stakeholder is the prime concern. In this paper we analyse available IoT security in three forms: (i) security in communication, (ii) security at application interface, and (iii) data security. This paper reviews the current IoT technologies, approaches and models and finds the security gap in existing communication technologies, application interfaces, and data security. Another focus of the paper is to provide an overview of the related work in IoT, together with the open challenges and future research directions me”.},

abstract={The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has become the standard routing protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper investigates the use of RPL in dynamic networks and presents an enhanced RPL for different applications with dynamic mobility and diverse network requirements. This implementation of RPL is designed with a new dynamic Objective-Function (D-OF) to improve the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption while maintaining low packet overhead and loop-avoidance. We propose a controlled reverse-trickle timer based on received signal strength identification (RSSI) readings to maintain high responsiveness with minimum overhead and consult the objective function when a movement or an inconsistency is detected to help nodes make an informed decision. Simulations are done using Cooja with random waypoint mobility scenario for healthcare applications considering multi-hop routing. The results show that the proposed dynamic RPL (D-RPL) adapts to the nodes mobility and has a higher PDR, slightly lower end-to-end delay and reasonable energy consumption compared to related existing protocols.},

abstract={The amount of Internet of Things (IoT) data is growing rapidly. Although there is a growing understanding of the quality of such data at the device and network level, important challenges in interpreting and evaluating the quality at informational and application levels remain to be explored. This article discusses some of these challenges and solutions of IoT systems at the different OSI layers to understand the factors affecting the quality of the overall system. With the help of two IoT-enabled digital health applications, the authors investigate the role of semantics in measuring the data quality of the system, as well as integrating multimodal data for clinical decision support. They also discuss the extension of IoT to the Internet of Everything by including human-in-the-loop to enhance the system accuracy. This paradigm shift through the confluence of sensors and data analytics can lead to accelerated innovation in applications by overcoming the limitations of the current systems, leading to unprecedented opportunities in healthcare.},

abstract={Energy consumption by residential customers represents today around 30 to 40% of the total consumed energy, with the residential loads often to be charged for significant contribution to the peak demands both seasonal and daily. The integration of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) with power delivery infrastructure into Smart Grid (SG) will highly automate the production, distribution, monitoring and management of electric power, but will also introduce issues regarding consumer privacy. Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging scientific area with many practical applications to a vast variety of domains such as smart cities, home automation, autonomous vehicles, assistive technologies and healthcare. IoT is able to facilitate electric power management, by monitoring and controlling energy production and consumption, leading to significant savings. However, the IoT concept introduces several challenges and questions, with security, privacy and interoperability to be among them. In this paper, we discuss the integration of IoT and Fog computing with power systems towards efficient energy management and we illustrate a solution that preserves consumer privacy in smart grids.},

abstract={With the increase in popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), pervasive computing, healthcare services, sensor networks, and mobile devices, a lot of data is being generated at the perception layer. Cloud is the most viable solution for data storage, processing, and management. Cloud also helps in the creation of further services, refined according to the context and requirement. However, being reachable through the Internet, cloud is not efficient enough for latency sensitive multimedia services and other time-sensitive services, like emergency and healthcare. Fog, an extended cloud lying within the proximity of underlying nodes, can mitigate the issues traditional cloud cannot solve being standalone. Fog can provide quick response to the requiring applications. Moreover, it can preprocess and filter data according to the requirements. Trimmed data is then sent to the cloud for further analysis and enhanced service provisioning. However, how much better is it to have a fog in any particular scenario instead of a standalone cloud working without fog is a question right now. In this paper, we provide an answer by analyzing both cloud-only and cloud-fog scenarios in the context of processing delay and power consumption according to increasing number of users, on the basis of varying server load. The simulation is done through Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). Simulation results demonstrate that by the use of fog networks, users experienced lower waiting times and increased data rates.},

abstract={The internet of things (IoT) requires that more data are collected and processed by devices with faster response, but lower power consumption. In order to achieve these unprecedented requirements, a high-speed DRAM with low-power dissipation at standby and during low-frequency operation in a small footprint is necessary. In addition, a higher degree of reliability is expected for some applications: such as transportation and healthcare. One promising solution, on-chip error correction coding (ECC), has gained traction among memory companies [1] and is now required by the LPDDR4 standard for the first time [2]. In this paper, a 2Gb LPDDR4 that dissipates 75% less refresh current than a conventional LPDDR4 is presented. The proposed LPDDR4 exploits ECC to reduce refresh current, periodically activated voltage regulators to reduce standby power, and dual CA buffers to save the buffer current during low frequency operation. In addition, circuit designs for cell screen of DRAM with on-chip ECC, and for high-speed wafer test for known good die (KGD) - essential for small form factor devices using system-in-package (SiP) - are presented.},

Nevertheless, it makes the management, control and programmability of networks and IoT applications (Smart city, Smart healthcare, Industry, etc.) extremely complex. Therefore, we propose an SDN-based architecture to manage heterogeneity of the devices and the networks. Our solution is based on the utilization of dockers implemented on devices. In this paper, we focus on the connectivity of heterogeneous devices beyond heterogeneous networks.

title={Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers},
year={2017},
volume={60},
number={1},
pages={4-23},
abstract={Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-qu- lity expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},

abstract={Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) services such as healthcare, smart cities, and marine monitoring are pervasive in cyber-physical environments strongly supported by Internet technologies and fog computing. Complex IoT services are increasingly composed of sensors, devices, and compute resources within fog computing infrastructures. The orchestration of such applications can be leveraged to alleviate the difficulties of maintenance and enhance data security and system reliability. However, efficiently dealing with dynamic variations and transient operational behavior is a crucial challenge within the context of choreographing complex services. Furthermore, with the rapid increase of the scale of IoT deployments, the heterogeneity, dynamicity, and uncertainty within fog environments and increased computational complexity further aggravate this challenge. This article gives an overview of the core issues, challenges, and future research directions in fog-enabled orchestration for IoT services. Additionally, it presents early experiences of an orchestration scenario, demonstrating the feasibility and initial results of using a distributed genetic algorithm in this context.},

A mobile device in this context can be effectively considered Internet of Things (IoT), which can provide advanced online services to both healthcare provider and requestor under the control and monitor of the HAAD. Health information is among the most sensitive information of an individual that can be collected and shared. The information that needs to be protected in the healthcare sector is often referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI). Service providers with a good reputation for privacy protection will find it easier to build a trusted relationship with their users. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) defines a set of security and privacy rules to be followed by healthcare providers in the United States of America. The HIPAA standards are designed for protecting health information.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology and infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Networked body sensing devices coupled with sensors in our living environment enable the real-time and continuous collection of information related to an individual's physical and mental health and related behaviors. Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques. A set of representative health applications that take advantage of such tools is also described. Finally, various challenges and opportunities that arise during the realization of smart and connected healthcare IoT are highlighted.},

abstract={With the recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is now possible to process a large number of sensor data streams using different large-scale IoT platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications. Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless interoperability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the Web.},

abstract={Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) are a challenging research area with applications in healthcare and entertainment. Due to the importance of the target applications in the daily life, BASNs are a promising candidate for being included into the future Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the data gathering of the human activity may help customizing the services provided by the IoT and thus dramatically improve the IoT user experience. Magnetic Induction (MI) based communication is known in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT), near-field communication (NFC), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in challenging environments. In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate. In this work, we analyze the potential of the distributed beamforming based MI-BASNs. We observe a significant increase of the achievable data rate for the proposed distributed beamforming compared to our selected baseline scheme.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and big data, more comprehensive and powerful applications become available. Meanwhile, people pay more attention to higher QoE and QoS in a “terminal- cloud” integrated system. Specifically, both advanced terminal technologies (e.g., smart clothing) and advanced cloud technologies (e.g., big data analytics and cognitive computing in clouds) are expected to provide people with more reliable and intelligent services. Therefore, in this article we propose a Wearable 2.0 healthcare system to improve QoE and QoS of the next generation healthcare system. In the proposed system, washable smart clothing, which consists of sensors, electrodes, and wires, is the critical component to collect users' physiological data and receive the analysis results of users' health and emotional status provided by cloud-based machine intelligence.},

abstract={The rapid proliferation and ubiquitous nature of mobile technology within the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) driven smart and connected communities (SCC) paradigm promises a unified framework for tackling community-based health challenges. Maternal and child mortality remains a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, with one of its leading cause being inadequate provision of nutrients (or under-nutrition). This paper presents an indigenous mobile health (or mHealth) solution, named GRAVID, to address the gap of unavailability of context-based information on nutrition, medical, drug and substance use appropriate to meet identified needs of gravid women and subsequently their babies (for 5 years); within the African context. GRAVID also provides a monitoring tool for healthcare givers to track the progress of the gravid woman they oversee. The project was implemented with Android software development kit (SDK) for cost-effective development and widespread community coverage. It is intended that this solution will also provide a source of collecting data to update necessary information as well as addressing related community-based issues to reduce the maternal and child mortality rates.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) becomes important and various used in many applications. In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application. The application performance is evaluated by user satisfaction scores.},

abstract={The exponentially growing healthcare costs coupled with the increasing interest of patients in receiving care in the comfort of their own homes have prompted a serious need to revolutionize healthcare systems. This has prompted active research in the development of solutions that enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor and evaluate the health of patients in the comfort of their residences. However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.},

abstract={Fog computing is a recently proposed computing paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for time-sensitive healthcare applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early notification of emergency situations to support smart decision making. While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications. In this work, we present dynamic Fog, a high level programming model for time-sensitive applications that are geospatially distributed, large-scale, and latency-sensitive. We also analyze our fog model with healthcare data, more specifically with Heartrate data that is one of the most time-sensitive medical data which deals with life and death situations. Our experiments show that our proposed system achieves minimum delay while it also achieves the data accuracy and data consistency which are very important in many applications like medical data.},

pages={335-342},
abstract={With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart sensor technologies, the data-driven paradigm has been found promising to support human behavioral analysis in a smart home for better healthcare and well-being of senior adults. This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.},

abstract={Healthcare is beginning to embrace point of care (POC) diagnostics and medical applications that are based on the internet of things (IoT) and the ubiquitous smart phone. Advanced medical diagnostics will utilize biosensors for biological data acquisition. This paper introduces the forecasting of biosensors that have the potential to be used in POC and IoT applications. For this research three types of biosensors were selected. These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively. Bibliometrics with annual publication count did not appear to provide much value in forecasting the maturity growth of the three biosensors.},

Then, we devise three attack scenarios, namely an illegal device pairing attack, a fake wearable gateway attack and an insecure code based attack. Using a real commercial smartband used for healthcare monitoring, we observe that these scenarios actually can intrude wearable services, obtaining privacy data such as personal identifiers and health information. Finally, we analyze these attacks with the viewpoint of the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) IoT (Internet of Things) Top 10 security weaknesses and suggest countermeasures that can prevent these attacks.},

The underlying cloud-based Internet-of-Things (IoT-Cloud) infrastructure is aimed to be implemented in the city of Lubumbashi in the republic Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with the objective of setting up a community health care network around a mesh of health kiosks. We propose a deployment model for the proposed Cyber-healthcare system, and describe a patient prioritization process as part of its situation awareness component. The results obtained from an experimental prototype reveal the field readiness of the off-the-shelf bio-sensor technology used by the system, the performance achieved when using a solar powered subsystem, the relative communication capabilities provided by its protocols and the network engineering feasibility of the planned community health care network. The relative efficiency of using supervised machine learning compared to unsupervised machine learning when performing patient prioritization, is also revealed through two popular algorithms: Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and K-means clustering (KMC).},

One major issue to address in this context is the identification of a suitable middleware able to leverage the potentialities offered by the Internet of Things and, at the same time, ensure the necessary support to services and functions related to healthcare and personal assistance. This paper provides an overview of middleware solutions designed for Internet of Things in health and wellness domains, and presents a case study related to assistive technology for the home monitoring of people with dementia.

Mesh topology was decided to be used as it provides important advantages. Moreover, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used for the data compression and transferring, and the Scalable High-Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) is used for the video compression and transferring. The SHVC can deliver the same video quality in half of the bit rate than the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Furthermore, cloud services are provided, such as storage and real-time monitoring. Finally, we made a comparative analysis between our proposed system architecture and two other approaches. From this analysis, we can say that our system architecture has some benefits instead of other similar architectures. Also, we made an analysis of the bandwidth and the network throughput. The results are significant since the bandwidth required for the transmission of data and video is reduced.},

abstract={Recent years have seen the development of successful internet of things (IoT) technologies based on an IP-enabled 6LoWPAN, which enables the extensive message exchange of information generated from various applications such as healthcare, smart home, and factory automation. Because IoT devices are closely related to the human life, they generally handle critical data which must be protected from a malicious adversary. However, a majority of IoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of memory and computational ability, so that they cannot provide heavy security protocols and authentication. To protect connections over constrained networks, we introduce a back-end offload architecture which offloads the processing of a security protocol to a specified back-end offloader. The offloader assists constrained devices back-end by handling the packets of handshake procedure and encrypted application data. The load balancing of offloaders and the protection of offload messages are also provided in the design. The proposed architecture allows an extremely constrained device to establish a secure session by utilizing high-level authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate, without the burden of deploying heavy security modules. This research would be advantageous for incompetent nodes to support security and reduce cost at the same time.},

Automated water usage monitoring system proposes an effective way of controlling the wastage of water at home/Industries by means of Wireless sensor nodes and LabVIEW software. At many places water is luxuriously wasted while many areas don't have enough. Sensor nodes are placed at every water outlet pointes sensing the flow of water. The concept of internet of things (IOT) is used to continuously monitor and track water usage via the wireless sensor nodes. Server collects the data through Wi-Fi/LAN to process and track usage and wastage of water at every outlet. When water is used at excess it is indicated and an alert is sent to the user. The user can continuously keep a track of the water usage or wastage through a mobile or laptop with an internet connection. This proposed water monitoring system helps the individuals to keep a track on their water bills and helps the government to manage the water supply and modify billing scheme based on the water usage.},

IP stacks and web servers technological developments are used for smart every day objects. This paper describes how IOT can be implemented in the realistic way to invoke the vision. The contents which we can use in IOT can come into picture from a big area of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders, electric clams in coastal water automobiles with the help of built in sensors among them. If we want to develop a fully integrated future internet then IOT is steeped out by enable and using the technologies which is based on wireless such as RFID tokens and attached from nodes of actuator and sensing devices.

abstract={The Internet-of-Things relies on ad-hoc connections, which also requires an on-demand approach to the negotiation of security parameters. We propose a new approach to shared key derivation for Body Area Networks (BANs). Body area networks are quickly becoming increasingly important in the world of healthcare with wide application in the treatment and monitoring of chronic patients using on-body devices. Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys. We show that these measurements results in derived keys that are unpredictable and exhibit significant difference with previous keys. This is an improvement over existing schemes where keys vary for different hosts but tend to be similar over time.},

abstract={Secrecy and integrity of communication, as well as the authenticity of messages must be ensured by the security primitives and is critical element in Internet of Things (IoT). Devices in IoT applications such as smart healthcare applications deal with sensitive data of our health and daily lives and thus can execute malicious actuating commands with serious safety consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure secure communication channel establishment among the medical sensors or devices and the remote servers. In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is energy efficient.},

abstract={Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies allow the intelligent sensor systems to effectively and efficiently observe and identify human behaviour in many applications, particularly in energy consumption and healthcare sectors. One typical case is that how to use IoT technologies to understand human water use behaviour for improved and sustained hygiene practice. Traditionally, static behaviour intervention models are widely utilised to simulate behaviour intervention process over time. These static methods can predict targeted human behaviour reasonably well, but lack of capabilities on understanding and responding behaviour change process in IoT environments. In this study, the authors proposed a dynamic behaviour intervention model for predicting household water user behaviour for improved hygiene practices. This model is based on an expanded theory of planned behaviour (ETPB), and adopted structure equation model approach and control engineering concept. A case study of household water consumption model using artificial neural network is utilised to evaluate intervention trend of proposed ETPB dynamic behaviour model with system parameter identification. The ETPB dynamic model has been proved to be effective for modelling human behaviour intervention process.},

abstract={The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.},

However, indoor IoT is required in some applications such as target detection and tracking, and emerging smarter healthcare. As such, localisation approaches designed for indoor IoT are necessary. Note that the smarter healthcare emerges at an unprecedented speed while few localisation schemes can be directly exploited for them with accuracy guarantee. In this study, the authors propose a wearable indoor localisation approach to improve the localisation accuracy of previous work. In this approach, the wearable devices embedded into person are used to realise their displacement vector in mobile environments, thus estimating their own locations. In addition, the authors propose a walking prediction mechanism to increase localisation accuracy.

Moving forward we expect to see their dominance in automotive applications. At the same time, we are seeing increased interest in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect trillions of sensors. We are preparing for Internet of Everything (IoE) applications where people, process, data and devices are going to be connected through new generation of electronics which are not possible today. Therefore, our research is focused on hybrid integration of heterogeneous materials, processes and devices to build free form (flexible, stretchable, reconfigurable in shape and size) interactive and high-performance electronics and systems for smart living and a sustainable future focusing on healthcare, water, food and environment. For scientific exploration, we develop integration strategy to make collective use of the materials, processes and device architecture leveraging multidisciplinary tracks of electrical engineering, material science, bioengineering, computer science and engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering (focusing plants and marine science) and health science. As engineering tool, we use CMOS technology extensively due to its industrial relevance, maturity and reliability for rapid tech transfer.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an ubiquitous concept where physical objects are connected over the internet and are provided with unique identifiers to enable their self-identification to other devices and the ability to transmit data over the network. Sensor nodes along with their heterogeneous nature are the main part of the IoT and may act as internet hosts or clients. Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication. By using this protocol, resource-constrained nodes can also benefit from the same security functionalities that are typical of unconstrained domains, without however having to execute computationally intensive operations. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic operations of constrained nodes to the neighboring trusted nodes or devices. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is sufficiently energy efficient.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a paradigm that connects devices and objects through the network to share information. Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.},

abstract={In the rapidly growing Internet of Things, applications across different businesses are getting wirelessly connected to the internet. The ubiquitous smart devices can generate enormous amount of data which along with real-time analytics can drive unprecedented innovations, trigger new business models and at some point deeply touch the human life. As IoT's start driving mission critical applications, the need to pro-actively monitor and manage their performance-availability-scalability levels becomes paramount. Failure in doing so can lead to a direct impact on business and now to human life as IoT's get increasingly used in healthcare. Monitoring millions of devices generating enormous amount of data is a huge challenge but one which needs to be addressed soon.

abstract={In the field of Ambient Assisted Living a limited amount of research aims at supporting caregivers that work with people with disabilities in assisted living facilities (ALFs). In fact, research activities on healthcare support systems in AAL mainly focus on improving the quality of life for people in their own homes or supporting nurses and doctors in hospitals. This paper explores and applies the Internet of Things paradigm in the ALFs context. In particular, we present the design, the implementation, and the experimental evaluation of a system capable of supporting the daily activities of healthcare assistants that operate in ALFs for people with physical or cognitive disabilities. The solution combines wearable and mobile technologies to improve assistance requests and anomaly detection. With this healthcare support system, caregivers can be automatically alerted of potentially hazardous situations that happen to the inhabitants while these are out of sight. Furthermore, inhabitants can require assistance instantly and from any point of the facility. We evaluated the system in two ways. We performed a functional test with two professional caregivers, and we deployed the system in an ALF in Italy for 36 hours, collecting the opinions of the involved caregivers and inhabitants.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things architecture aims to provide smart connectivity not only with existing computers, but also with new context-aware computing resources, extending soon beyond von Neumann devices for the purpose of mining, prediction, and control of cyber and physical components. These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms. Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems. By carefully analyzing the spatiotemporal workload characteristics of the NMPC problems, we propose the design of an efficient NoC architecture. Our proposed NoC architecture achieves up to 29% improvement in latency and 28% improvement in energy dissipation over the conventional mesh NoC-based counterpart.},

abstract={Connected data has always been considered as a primary source to knowledge. Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable. Rather it adds to the foundation notion of ubiquitous services by making available to everyone and everywhere. The new age eHealth facilities are expected to enable end-to-end monitoring systems even at remote scenarios, helping medical services reach the unreach- d.},

The main concern of this paper is the IoBNT, which projects the prospective application domain where the activities of very tiny, biocompatible, and non-intrusive devices operating in an in-body nanonetwork can be monitored and controlled through the Internet. In this paper, we present an illustrative scenario and system model of an IoBNT for application in an advanced healthcare delivery system. To address one of the major challenges of the IoBNT, we present an exemplary architecture and model of a bio-cyber interface for connecting the conventional electromagnetic-based Internet to the biochemical signaling-based bionanonetwork. The bio-cyber interface is designed and modeled by employing biological concepts, such as the responsiveness of certain biomolecules to thermal and light stimuli, and the bioluminescence phenomenon of some biochemical reactions. The analysis in this paper focuses on the system that comprises the bio-cyber interface and the information propagation network of the blood vessel that leads to the in-body nanonetwork location. The effects of the system and design parameters associated with the IoBNT models presented are numerically evaluated.},

Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen. Besides the description of the application, the main contribution of the article is the analysis of the emerging privacy issues of the proposed application and the discussion of possible countermeasures.},

abstract={The recent technological advances related to computing, storage, cloud, networking and the unstoppable deployment of end-user devices, are all coining the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). IoT embraces a wide set of heterogeneous services in highly impacting societal sectors, such as Healthcare, Smart Transportation or Media delivery, all of them posing a diverse set of requirements, including real time response, low latency, or high capacity. In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics. To that end, in this paper, we introduce and formulate the QoS-aware service allocation problem for CFC architectures as an integer optimization problem, whose solution minimizes the latency experienced by the services while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the capacity requirements.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is formed by smart objects and services to interact in real time, and that are deployed in various applications such as home monitoring, healthcare, and smart cities. However, security concerns should not be overlooked since an adversary could exploit the vulnerabilities in the design of some secure protocols. To this aim, in this paper we focus in particular on broadcast authentication in resource constrained devices. This security service is still in its infancy when devices are deployed in unattended environments. We propose a new authentication mechanism based on the state of the art protocol μTESLA, that aims to reduce the delay of forged packets in the receivers buffer, by efficiently computing the key disclosure delay. Then, we integrate this mechanism to two protocols of state of the art LEAP and LEAP++. Furthermore, we assess the feasibility of our solution with a thorough simulation study, taking into account the energy consumption, the delay of forged packets, and the authentication delay.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is now transitioning from theory to practice. This means that a lot of data will be generated and the management of this data is going to be a big challenge. To transform IoT into reality and build upon realistic and more useful services, better resource management is required at the perception layer. In this regard, Fog computing plays a very vital role. With the advent of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) and remote healthcare and monitoring, quick response time and latency minimization are required. However, the receiving nodes have a very fluctuating behavior in resource consumption especially if they are mobile. Fog, a localized cloud placed close to the underlying IoTs, provides the means to cater such issues by analyzing the behavior of the nodes and estimating resources accordingly. Similarly, Service Level Agreement (SLA) management and meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements also become issues. In this paper, we devise a methodology, referred to as MEdia FOg Resource Estimation (MeFoRE), to provide resource estimation on the basis of service give-up ratio, also called Relinquish Rate (RR), and enhance QoS on the basis of previous Quality of Experience (QoE) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) records. The algorithms are implemented using CloudSim and applied on real IoT traces on the basis of Amazon EC2 resource pricing.},

abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.},

In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},

abstract={The IEEE 802.11ah technology, targeting vast amount of use cases within the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) expansion, is currently being finalized. This IoT/M2M connectivity technology is deployed at the sub-1 GHz ISM bands, that are subject to various coexistence regulations set by the authorities. In Europe, devices in the Sub-1 GHz ISM bands must comply with the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%, provided that they also support Listen Before Talk (LBT) and Adaptive Frequency Agility (AFA) features. In this article we investigate the challenges of such duty cycle limitation and its effect on the IEEE 802.11ah network performance from the uplink transmission perspective, considering typical use cases characterized by different traffic models. We first derive the theoretical maximum duty cycles of both an individual station and an individual AP assuming full-buffer or saturated traffic. Then, with emphasis on more practical uses cases, such as home/building automation and healthcare, where the traffic of an individual station or node is strongly unsaturated, we analyze the IEEE 802.11ah network performance without and with the 2.8% maximum duty cycle limitation. The obtained results show IEEE 802.11ah networks can provide efficient support for the most important use cases such as sensor networking, home automation and healthcare, despite the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%. This shows that IEEE 802.11ah is one of the most prominent and scalable IoT/M2M connectivity technology, that can enable different types of IoT applications, even in the presence of the tight coexistence requirements at the ISM band.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a computing process, where each physical object is equipped with sensors, microcontrollers and transceivers for empowering communication and is built with suitable protocol stacks which help them interacting with each other and communicating with the users. In IoT based healthcare, diverse distributed devices aggregate, analyse and communicate real time medical information to the cloud, thus making it possible to collect, store and analyse the large amount of data in several new forms and activate context based alarms. This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system. This work explains the implementation of an IoT based In-hospital healthcare system using ZigBee mesh protocol. The healthcare system implementation can periodically monitor the physiological parameters of the In-hospital patients. Thus, IoT empowered devices simultaneously enhance the quality of care with regular monitoring and reduce the cost of care and actively engage in data collection and analysis of the same.},

There have been distinctive health challenges focused in the society through technical innovations. Most of the elderly people today experiences loneliness and psychological depressions, either as a result of living alone/ abandonment or due to reduced connection with their children and relatives. To enhance the quality of services in the elderly healthcare system we have developed a ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based (Internet of Things) Help to You (H2U) healthcare system to integrate various technologies of wearable devices, biosensors and wireless sensor networks in order to provide an intensive service management platform. This method would support the real time activity and monitor the healthcare system for the elderly citizens. In this method the information collected by various wearable devices in real time are stored in the central database which thereby connects people, doctors, and practitioner at the time of an emergency for the right information. This way the system could increase accessibility, efficiency, and also lower the health expenses to improve the comfort and safety as well as management of daily routines of an elderly life.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows users to connect various sensors and smart devices to collect real-time data from the environment. However, it has been observed that a comprehensive platform is still missing in the e-Health and m-Health architectures to use smartphone sensors to sense and transmit important data related to a patient's health. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we critically evaluate the existing literature, which discusses the effective ways to deploy IoT in the field of medical and smart health care. Secondly, we propose a new semantic model for patients' e-Health. The proposed model named as `k-Healthcare' makes use of 4 layers; the sensor layer, the network layer, the Internet layer and the services layer. All layers cooperate with each other effectively and efficiently to provide a platform for accessing patients' health data using smart phones.},

Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) employs smart devices as its building blocks for developing a ubiquitous communication framework.

While offering a novel communication paradigm, IoT finds its requirements closely connected to the security issues. The role of security following the fact that a new type of devices known as wearables constitute an emerging area. This paper delivers an applicability study of the state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives for wearable IoT devices, including the pairing-based cryptography. Pairing-based schemes are well-recognized as fundamental enablers for many advanced cryptographic applications, such as privacy protection and identity-based encryption. To deliver a comprehensive view on the computational power of modern wearable devices (smart phones, watches, and embedded devices), we perform an evaluation of a variety of them utilizing bilinear pairing for real-time communication. In order to deliver a complete picture, the obtained bilinear pairing results are complemented with performance figures for classical cryptography (such as block ciphers, digital signatures, and hash functions). Our findings show that wearable devices of today have the needed potential to efficiently operate with cryptographic primitives in real time. Therefore, we believe that the data provided during this research would shed light on what devices are more suitable for certain cryptographic operations.},

These systems cannot use the data and knowledge of other similar systems due to the complexity involved in sharing data between them.

abstract={The future of ambient assisted living (AAL) especially eHealthcare almost depends on the smart objects that are part of the Internet of things (IoT). In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.},

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time responses. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data has to be uploaded to the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, the cloud on the edge of the network, known as Fog or Micro Datacenter (MDC), plays an important role. Fog resides between the underlying Internet of Things (IoTs) and the mega datacenter cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. To achieve this, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we propose in this paper. Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can stop using resources at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management through Fog computing, we take into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. With the intent of showing practical implications of our method, we implemented it on Crawdad real trace and Amazon EC2 pricing. Based on various services, differentiated through Amazon's price plans and historical record of Cloud Service Customers (CSCs), the model determines the amount of resources to be allocated. More loyal CSCs get better services, while for the contrary case, the provider reserves resources cautiously.},

abstract={We always make efforts to predict our future from the past and the present, since the prediction can make great changes in our life, especially in the fields of science and technology. Many organizations in the globe have surveys and announces emerging or disruptive technologies every year. Of course, they have developed their own processes to achieve the goal, but the insights of experts from related domains are usually absolute. In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results. We named this approach as Chi(Computer Human Interacting)-Delphi method for technology foresight. As Web goes to connect machine intelligences in the era of Internet of Things, the collaboration between human intelligence and machine intelligence will be eventually the next great wave for predicting the future.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is nowadays increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected devices uniquely addressable, via a standard communication protocol. Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested by analyzing healthcare data sets, mainly comprises of activities including walking, running, ECG. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core™i5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. The results show that the proposed architecture efficiently analyze the massive volume of data with a maximum throughput.},

This phenomenon is very common all over the world, and it doesn't any exception, even though the healthcare and wellness areas. To keep up with the times, there are many wearable devices and solutions in these fields. However, the devices or solutions which is related to infant are very few. Although there are many advantages when it comes to apply to the infant, it falls short of our expectations yet. To decrease the infant mortality and accident rate, we propose the design of infant health condition check solution, which are included to a wearable device and camera. The proposed design solution utilize the AHRS to measure the infant's attitude, and uses various biometric sensors to get a biometric information. Based on this scheme, the parent or protector of infant can acquire the infant health condition information, and they can cope with some emergency situations.},

Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology. Due to its popularity in technology and internet world, IoT is rising in every field of life and so in health sector. Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. But it's still not implemented for the broad scope of Hospitals, and especially in Pakistan it's not being used for any purpose in health sector. So we need to define and provide IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS). In this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems. We have used Context awareness as middleware above network layer to overcome the problem of data management. Moreover we did survey to investigate the decision to adopt the IoT based system in Pakistani Hospitals. Survey was questionnaire based. The accumulated results indicate that participants want to adopt this system and most of the population agreed that IoT based HMIS would provide better monitoring, communication and early diagnosis.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is construed as a broad interconnectivity of everyday devices and entities, such that their collaborative engagements can create superior externalities. It is distinguished from the "sensorweb" through the capabilities of IoT devices to operate and reason on, and with, inputs from multiple sources. In this work we postulate that vehicles have a previously unexplored role to play in driving widespread acceptance, and adoption, of mobile cloud, IoT and AAL principles, concepts and systems. We argue that, historically, deployment of new, disruptive technological paradigms has been slow and the notion of IoT devices being deeply embedded in our everyday environment, and working and collaborating to enhance and support our daily existences (Ambient Assisted Living), makes "realizing tomorrow's potential difficult. But not impossible" for industry actors. This work re-envisions common approaches to presenting AAL research and focuses on emerging and future enabler technologies and platforms that will provide direct AAL interactions and experiences for end users. The use-case and deployment scenario is that of present day and future vehicular and transportation infrastructure networks, with exemplars in the global societal challenge of healthcare for aging populations.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems have become a main part in future internet research. In IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe special tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact between the integrated devices and diverse services. Considering the healthcare research, the number of elderly people is rapidly growing and they need more support in their life. Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been established as a best communication paradigm for future internet, particularly in IoT. Based on hierarchically structured names, ICN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and provides an efficient and intelligent communication paradigm for both IoT and AAL (IoT-AAL) technologies. In this work, we design an IoT architecture for AAL via ICN approach which will effectively improve the performance of communication between the heterogeneous devices and services integrated in IoT-AAL.},

abstract={Nowadays, ageing related diseases represent one of the most relevant challenges for developed countries. The use of healthcare remote technology may allow reducing most of the management of the chronic diseases meanwhile it may also contribute to the improvement of elderly people's quality of life. Unfortunately, despite the advent of Internet of things and the even decreasing price of sensors, current proposals are not extensible during runtime meaning that they need to be maintained offline by engineers. Therefore, in this paper we discuss how to build an ad-hoc extensible (during runtime) healthcare monitoring system by using low cost wireless sensors and already existent Internet of things technology as communication platform. Moreover, we present a prototype of a basic healthcare remote monitoring system, which alerts, in real time, patients' relatives or medical doctors that an elderly people is experienced a problem that could need medical attention or hospitalization.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoTs) is gaining increasing significance due to real-time communication and decision making capabilties of sensors integrated into everyday objects. IoTs are power and bandwidth-constrained with applications in smarthome, healthcare, transportation and industrial domains. Routing bears significant importance in IoTs where sensors acting as hosts deliver data to the gateways which in turn impacts power consumption. Thus there exists a need for modeling and analysis of routing in IoT networks towards predicting power consumption. In this work, we develop an analytical model of a naive flooding based routing protocol using Markov chains. In particular, we derive steady state transition probabilities of transmit and receive states using protocol execution traces and further utilize them towards predicting power consumption. Our approach to modeling is generic in that it can be applied to routing protocols across domains. Evaluation of the model shows that the predicted values for power consumption lie closer to the actual observations obtained using ns-2 simulation thus resulting in minimal mean square errors.},

Market research company Gartner estimates that around 4.9 billion connected things will be in use in 2015, and around 25 billion by 2020. While there are substantial opportunities accompanying IoT, spanning from Healthcare to Energy, there are an equal number of concerns regarding the security and privacy of this plethora of ubiquitous devices. In this position paper we approach security and privacy in IoT from a different perspective to existing research, by considering the impact that IoT may have on the growing problem of insider threat within enterprises. Our specific aim is to explore the extent to which IoT may exacerbate the insider-threat challenge for organisations and overview the range of new and adapted attack vectors. Here, we focus especially on (personal) devices which insiders bring and use within their employer's enterprise. As a start to addressing these issues, we outline a broad research agenda to encourage further research in this area.},

abstract={Humankind has been collecting data since the recording started, but in the last decade with the considerable advances in computing and storage technologies, advancements of cloud computing, development of ubiquitous connectivity and the internet of things, there has been explosion in the size and variety of collected data. Nevertheless, one can be data-rich and knowledge-poor, and this is where the data analytics and the development and application of machine learning models become necessity for gaining insight of complex processes to prove scientific theories and discoveries, support decision making and enhance strategic planning in different areas of the economy, finance, industry, healthcare, etc. Recently, there is an influx of polymorphic, unstructured and multimodal data - social media, images, audio, video, etc., which is complicating further the data processing and knowledge extraction process. But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected- pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that. Then will briefly talk about supervised and unsupervised learning and the use of three supervised approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Random Forests (RF); and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving radar signal classification and source identification problem. Results from applying the NN, RF and SVM (using R and Matlab) on complete data subset (without missing data) and the full dataset with substituted (up to 60%) missing data with MI, KNN-I and BTl will be critically analysed and discussed. Finally, I'll talk about the opportunities and challenges in applying computational intelligence and machine learning techniques to Big Data and the available software for Big Data.},

Major roadblocks to the deployment and prevalent use of IoTs are power and privacy-security vulnerabilities. IoTs have conflicting requirements and choosing appropriate tradeoffs based on the situation will lead to its increased use.

In the modern health care environment, the usage of IoT technologies brings convenience of physicians and patients, since they are applied to various medical areas (such as real-time monitoring, patient information management, and healthcare management). The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT developments in healthcare system, where a patient can be monitored using a collection of tiny-powered and lightweight wireless sensor nodes. However, the development of this new technology in healthcare applications without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. In this paper, at first, we highlight the major security requirements in BSN-based modern healthcare system. Subsequently, we propose a secure IoT-based healthcare system using BSN, called BSN-Care, which can efficiently accomplish those requirements.},

abstract={Using internet of things (IoT) to connect things, service, and people for intelligent operations has been discussed and deployed in many industry domains such as smart city, smart energy, healthcare, food and water tracking, logistics and retail, and transportation. However, scarce information is available for IoT usage in industrial automation domain for reliable and collaborative automation with respect to e.g., enabling scalable collaboration between heterogeneous devices and systems, offering predictable and fault-tolerant real-time closed-loop control, and inclusion of intelligent service features from edge devices to the cloud. In this paper, we will clarify the specific quality attribute constraints within industrial automation, present specific industrial IoT challenges due to these constraints, and discuss the potentials of utilizing some technical solutions to cope with these challenges.},

abstract={Healthcare solutions through the introduction of wearable healthcare devices are benefitting from Internet of Things technology. Though these small form-factor wearable devices promise great benefits, guaranteeing long device operating lifetime is yet the biggest challenge due to high-energy consumption. In this paper, a reduced hardware architecture system-on-chip targeting digital block design was proposed higher energy efficiency. The design has been verified by synthesizing into FPGA and implemented in silicon based on Silterra 180nm process. Results show that the proposed design achieved reduction up to 24% of leakage power and 15% of dynamic power reduction over reference design. In addition, 24.3% of excessive area was reduced by using the proposed reduced hardware architecture technique.},

abstract={Many application scenarios for IoT (Internet of Things) require the interconnection of high speed sensing nodes with data rates of Gbps. As an example surveillance or smart mobility applications adopt multiple photo and video cameras working at different spectral range (visible, near infrared, far infrared) and covering different fields of view, or they exploit arrays of radio/light detection and ranging (Radar/Lidar) sensors to detect the presence of targets, of their speeds, distance and direction. Even the access of distributed nodes in IoT towards a centralized cloud storage/processing center requires high data rate connections. Since low size and low weight of the nodes are needed, IoT can benefit from the high communication data rate, several Gbps, that can be provided by fully integrated mm-wave wireless transceivers. The wavelength at such frequency is few mm and hence the whole transceiver including the antenna can be integrated in a single chip. To this aim, this paper presents the design of 60 GHz transceiver key blocks (Low Noise Amplifier, Power Amplifier, Antenna) to ensure connection distances up to 10 m and data rate of several Gbps. Around 60 GHz worldwide there are freely-available (unlicensed) several GHz of bandwidth. By using a CMOS SOI technology RF, analog and digital baseband circuitry can be integrated in the same chip minimizing noise coupling. Even the antenna is integrated on chip reducing cost and size vs. classic off-chip antenna solutions. The proposed transceiver allows for the implementation of low cost nodes for IoT systems with data rates of several Gbps and with a 10 m link distance. These specifications are suitable for home/office scenarios, or for body area networks (healthcare, wellness) or for applications on board vehicles (cars, trains, ships, airplanes).},

abstract={There exists, today, a wide consensus that Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a wide range of business opportunities for various industries and sectors like Manufacturing, Healthcare, Public infrastructure management, Telecommunications and many others. On the other hand, the technological evolution of IoT facing serious challenges. The fragmentation in terms of communication protocols and data formats at device level is one of these challenges. Vendor specific application architectures, proprietary communication protocols and lack of IoT standards are some reasons behind the IoT fragmentation. In this paper we propose a software enabled framework to address the fragmentation challenge. The framework is based on flexible communication agents that are deployed on a gateway and can be adapted to various devices communicating different data formats using different communication protocol. The communication agent is automatically generated based on specifications and automatically deployed on the Gateway in order to connect the devices to a central platform where data are consolidated and exposed via REST APIs to third party services. Security and scalability aspects are also addressed in this work.},

abstract={Some applications introduced in each 5G mobile communication project (5G-P) assume special use cases such as when many people simultaneously use their mobile phone in a restricted area like a stadium or when using traffic safety systems are in common. And, some of them such as mobile healthcare and the Internet of things (IOT) have already been presented by many people. However, the reasons those applications will be widely used are uncertain. And then, most authors of articles related to future mobile communication made no mention of business schemes such as who deploys network infrastructure or who provides service content. However, the histories of existing mobile communication markets may show applications that are different from the ones written in the above articles and new business schemes that are different from existing ones. In this article, I analyze the dominant non-voice applications of the existing mobile communication systems including paging services and identify the primary factors that made them dominant. I also analyze the business models of the network carriers. This analysis leads me to forecast that the next-generation of dominant mobile communication applications will be developed on the basis of a balance between the freedom of participants and suspicion, and the business models will become more liberal. Moreover, I forecast that a service that comes after SNS messaging services will be the one in which experiences are shared.},

abstract={Rapid advances in digitalization, Internet and world wide web enable the communication between two computing hosts across any location in the globe. Pervasive or ubiquitous computing enhanced this to a level that any two intelligent physical objects can communicate with each other, anytime and anywhere. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm emerging from ubiquitous computing that facilitates communication between many real world objects by collaboration of various technologies. Integrating IoT with Cloud Computing derives manifold advantages to store and process enormous data generated by heterogeneous devices. Though both the technologies together have profound effect in many application areas like smart home, smart agriculture, healthcare etc., their integration involves many challenges. Security is one of the most important issues confronted by IoT-Cloud architecture. In this paper, we propose a Secure, Hybrid, Cloud Enabled architecture for IoT (SHCEI), which uses hybrid cloud (both public and private cloud). This architecture ensures security of intradomain data and will also address issues of scalability and interoperability. Further, we highlight some of the research challenges in implementing the combined architecture of Cloud and IoT.},

abstract={China's medical healthcare system has witnessed a great evolution from clinical normalization phase to pervasive informatization phase. Unquestionably, emergence of IoT (Internet of things) technology contributes to the development of medical healthcare informatization. Yet, it is widely researched and accepted that privacy protection has become a bottleneck of smart medical healthcare nowadays. Consequently, how to protect the privacy of users' information in a smart healthcare system remains a pending problem. Under this background, this paper analyses the main problems in current smart healthcare system. Furthermore, a lightweight private homomorphism algorithm and an encryption algorithm improved from DES are designed when considering the characteristic of IoT and privacy protection.

abstract={Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), a new concept that emerged about a year ago, integrating the IT and the Telecom worlds will have a great impact on the openness of the Telecom market. Furthermore, the virtualization revolution that has enabled the Cloud computing success will benefit the Telecom domain, which in turn will be able to support the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). The main objective of MEC solution is the export of some Cloud capabilities to the user's proximity decreasing the latency, augmenting the available bandwidth and decreasing the load on the core network. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of the future, has benefited from the proliferation in the mobile phones' usage. Many mobile applications have been developed to connect a world of things (wearables, home automation systems, sensors, RFID tags etc.) to the Internet. Even if it is not a complete solution for a scalable IoT architecture but the time sensitive IoT applications (e-healthcare, real time monitoring, etc.) will profit from the MEC architecture. Furthermore, IoT can extend this paradigm to other areas (e.g. Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks) with the use of Software Defined Network (SDN) orchestration to cope with the challenges hindering the IoT real deployment, as we will illustrate in this paper.},

Specifically, wearable technology and robotics can enable a user to collect the required human signals in a comfortable way. HealthIoT is the basic infrastructure for realizing health surveillance, and should be flexible to support multiple application demands and facilitate the management of infrastructure. Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device. This article discusses the background, advantages, and design details of the architecture proposed, which is achieved by an open-ended question and a potential solution. It opens a new research direction of HealthIoT and smart homes.},

abstract={The wide-spread use of wearable devices and mobile apps in the Internet of Things (IoT) environments makes effectively capture of life-logging personal health data come true. A long-term collection of these health data will benefit to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration. But most wearable devices and mobile apps in the market focus on personal fitness plan and lack of compatibility and extensibility to each other. Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation. Also, the demand on high security increases difficulties of designing reliable platform for integrating and managing multi-resource life-logging health data. This paper investigates the possibility of collecting and aggregating life-logging data with the use of wearable devices, mobile apps and social media. It compares existing personal health data collection solutions and identifies essential needs of designing a life-logging data aggregator in the IoT environments. An integrated data collection solution with high secure standard is proposed and deployed on a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare platform: MHA [15] by integrating five life-logging resources: Fitbit, Moves, Facbook, Twitter, etc. The preliminary experiment demonstrates that it successfully record, store and reuse the unified and structured personal health information in a long term, including activities, location, exercise, sleep, food, heat rate and mood.},

abstract={Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.},

On the other hand, construction and delivery of a smart service benefit from additional intelligence attributes, beyond a fixed set of healthcare services of a given medical information system. For this promising class of m-Health services, we introduce reference scenarios of personalized assistance for a mobile patient with focus on emergency cases. Our development employs the smart spaces paradigm: patients, medical personnel, healthcare services, and other participants operate within a common networked computing environment and interact by sharing information and its semantics.

abstract={The world is witnessing a spectacular shift in the delivery of health and wellness care. The key ingredient of this transformation consists in the use of revolutionary digital technologies to empower people in their self-management as well as to enhance traditional care procedures. While substantial domain-specific contributions have been provided to that end in the recent years, there is a clear lack of platforms that may orchestrate, and intelligently leverage, all the data, information and knowledge generated through these technologies. This work presents Mining Minds, an innovative framework that builds on the core ideas of the digital health and wellness paradigms to enable the provision of personalized healthcare and wellness support. Mining Minds embraces some of the currently most prominent digital technologies, ranging from Big Data and Cloud Computing to Wearables and Internet of Things, and state-of-the-art concepts and methods, such as Context-Awareness, Knowledge Bases or Analytics, among others. This paper aims at thoroughly describing the efficient and rational combination and interoperation of these modern technologies and methods through Mining Minds, while meeting the essential requirements posed by a framework for personalized health and wellness support.},

abstract={Monitoring individuals at risk is one of the great challenges of modern society, especially because the number of people who work and generate income assets in society has decreased while the number of the inactive population has increased. Increased life expectancy of the elderly and the technological evolution led to innovative and effective solutions for in-home monitoring and treatment of patients with chronical diseases. In this paper, a survey of Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications to e-Health is presented along with a case study using the K53 Tower System platform for e-Health. This platform offers a broad range of technologies for body area network (BAN) measurements and communications in healthcare and other medical applications. This paper proposes novel solutions to monitor people at risk, focusing on two fundamental and very important aspects: prevention as well as effective intervention in cases of medical emergency.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is becoming a reality thanks to the advances in sensing and communication technologies, which make it possible to provide monitoring and diagnosis services outside the premises of healthcare providers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the main paradigm through which medical devices will be connected to the Internet, thereby empowering near-realtime health services and transforming a patient's physical space into a smart space. Recent developments in nanotechnology are giving rise to the Internet of Nano-Things, with a new set of finegrained and highly sophisticated healthcare applications that can be run inside the human body. In this paper, we outline a vision of the ubiquitous healthcare ecosystem and its architectural requirements in order to incorporate nanonetworks. We identify some of the envisioned IoNT healthcare applications and the IoNT requirements that are necessary to support the different application categories, as well as the underlying healthcare service opportunities. In order to understand the current status of implementation, we provide a brief analysis of the major efforts targeted at IoNT performance analysis and evaluation. We finally discuss the most pressing challenges that the IoNT paradigm poses for healthcare applications and services.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging as a global Internet-based architecture connecting humans and objects at anytime and anywhere in order to facilitate the exchange of information, products, and services. To achieve this goal the precise descriptions of the objects, resources they use, and services they provide be made available in the IoT so that humans and objects can query, discover, and exchange services in the IoT. In this paper, a framework to meet these objectives is proposed. The key features of this environment are the integration of resource knowledge and “things” description in a class, creation of mini-configurations, loose coupling of the application management layer with IoT layer, and service generation and composition methods for “things” and clients external to the IoT. This framework can be specialized to any application domain, such as power grid, healthcare, and critical infrastructure monitoring.},

abstract={Technology advancements as well as the Internet-of-Things paradigm enable the design of wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems. Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to deliver connected automation for monitoring, optimization, and control of processes and systems in sectors such as the automotive, healthcare and security. In this way, the IoT promises to make better use of the available resources, enable real-time interaction, and support innovative applications. Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host. Within the proposed ETT, both the mobility model, as well as the detection thresholds are calculated solely based on sensory data, making the whole system both scalable and robust to dynamic changes. Experimental results demonstrate the many-fold improvements in efficiency of the proposed solution compared to traditional periodic tracking. These improvements are also validated in practice through an implementation on an operating bus route service.},

The growing popularity of IoT leads various services such as healthcare, connected car, smart education and smart home services. Among these services, smart home becomes commercialized most rapidly. We developed the Smart Home Protocol (SHP) to enable connectivity between various our smart home devices including smart appliances, LED bulbs, IP cameras, etc. In this paper, we present an overview of the SHP based on Restful architecture, followed by a detailed description of architecture and application profile for smart home devices. We also introduce our smart home services and describe the implementation of smart home protocol in smart appliances. To our understanding, this study is important, since it is a basis for enabling connectivity between our smart home products as well as those from other device and appliance manufacturers.

abstract={With the increasing availability of medical sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for personal use, it becomes feasible to maintain a repository of measurements for personal health conditions. Consequently, it is tempting to analyze in-progress diseases and to identify the development of potential diseases with the measurement repository. However, there are a number of technical challenges in developing such applications, modeling the relationships between diseases and acquired measurements, representing medical expertise in machine-readable forms, and high complexity in diagnosing disease methods. We adopt a semantic-based approach to resolve the first two challenges, and utilize the concept of cloud computing to tackle with the last challenge. In this paper, we present a cloud platform which provides a core set of functionality needed to enable personal medical diagnosis over the network. We believe that the presented platform provides a comprehensive core functionality needed for various types of personal healthcare IoT applications.},

abstract={Various industry forecasts project that, by 2020, there will be around 50 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), helping to engineer new solutions to societal-scale problems such as healthcare, energy conservation, transportation, etc. Most of these devices will be wireless due to the expense, inconvenience, or in some cases, the sheer infeasibility of wiring them. Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing - in some cases, even eliminating - their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems).},

abstract={Technology advances are creating major shifts in the industrial landscape. Traditional sectors such as transportation, medical and avionics, are witnessing fundamental changes in the supply chain and in the content where the interactions between the physical world and the computing world are becoming increasingly tight. Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS. Indeed, low power consumption is an essential requirement for the swarm of devices especially in the domain of wearable devices for healthcare. Coupled with low cost and reliability, power consumption has to be taken into consideration for any CPS deployment.},

abstract={Intelligent Knowledge as a Service (iKaaS) is an ambitious project aiming at integrating sensor management using Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services by employing sensor data. The platform design covers self-healing functions based on self-awareness as well as basic functions such as inter-cloud, security/privacy management, and devices and data management. From the viewpoint of application development, ontology sharing is the most important to integrate services. This paper, the first step towards ontology sharing, defines the iKaaS data model as one that integrates data models used in all applications in the project. The data defined in the iKaaS data model is converted into RDF format and stored in the RDF database. The reasoning mechanism in semantic web allows the semantic integration of data and applications. The iKaaS project is developing a prototype community service, town management and healthcare, in Tagonishi's Smart City. Presenting the iKaaS data model for these said services, this paper emphasizes the necessity of higher contextual awareness to achieve the goal of a better-fitted personalization for the individual.},

abstract={Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices permit the massive collection of biosignals (e.g., heart-rate, oxygen level, respiration, blood pressure, photo-plethysmographic signal, etc.) at low cost. These, can be used to help address the individual fitness needs of the users and could be exploited within personalized healthcare plans. In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity. State of the art solutions are also compared with our approach.},

abstract={Healthcare and tourism are among the fastest growing business domains in the world. These are biggest service industries that affect whole world population and give jobs to millions of people. Recently we witness major changes in both industries, as more services are transferred to small providers, including individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people. This provides a huge space for developing and applying new business models. In this paper we summarize research and development results of IoT studies and discuss ideas on how to apply them to business.},

abstract={Demand for medical services is increasing rapidly because of worldwide aging and increase in population. Most countries are trying to introduce and disseminate telemedicine service (TMS) to decrease the necessary budget for health services. However, many doctors are concerned about the security of telemedicine services. Security of medical information should be reinforced for widespread use of telemedicine. This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats. This paper considers the security aspects of telemedicine and the Internet of things (IoT) together, because, after all, healthcare-devices perform a function of telecommunication. This paper reviews the necessity and strategy for enhancing security of medical information systems. The risk of data leak in medical information systems is analyzed quantitatively and is used to support the need for reinforcement of security.},

abstract={Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems are widely used in numerous Internet-Of-Things (IoT) applications such as environment monitoring, supply chain tracing, healthcare, and vehicle networks. In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.},

abstract={Smart mobile people have a great potential to extend the existing Internet of Things infrastructures by implementing genuine ubiquitous healthcare (U-health) applications, ensuring anywhere and anytime patients connectivity. Through the forwarding of sensing data from person to person until reaching a connected medical server, concrete U-health becomes true with the emerging of future Body-to-Body Networks. Indeed, the coexistence of multiple WBANs (Wireless Body Area Networks), the communication and interactions between them extend the classical concept of WBAN and present the new paradigm referred to as Body-to-Body Network (BBN). This paradigm supports a number of innovative applications such as U-health, entertainment, interactive gaming and military, to cite a few. In this paper, we present a survey of BBNs focusing on three principal axes: energy efficiency, mobility prediction, and quality of service (QoS). Then, we present and discuss different candidate protocols that can be used in BBNs, while illustrating main BBN design challenges and several open issues.},

abstract={Embedded sensors are increasingly seen in modern mobile and wearable devices to support better user activities and vital signs monitoring. While more wireless sensing devices are becoming available, network connectivity and scalability remain the key obstacles in achieving seamless information flow and service provision as envisaged by the vision of the Internet of Things. In this paper, a mobile 6LoWPAN network architecture is proposed by engaging Android-based mobile devices as edge routers to address the connectivity and scalability issues with the wider IP network for pervasive healthcare applications. The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor network, together with the Android edge router, form a mobile sub-network that allows seamless information exchange with the Internet and improves service availability for each end user. The proposed architecture includes a customised bare-metal 6LoWPAN protocol designed for ultra low power wireless sensor nodes for long term vital signs monitoring and integrated with Android devices for mobile internet access. The proposed network architecture is demonstrated and validated on a pervasive healthcare monitoring application.},

abstract={Recent advances in information and communication technologies and embedded systems have given rise to a new disruptive technology, the Internet of Things (IoTs). IoT allows people and objects in the physical world as well as data and virtual environments to interact with each other so as to create smart environments, such as smart transport systems, smart cities, smart health, and so on. However, IoT raises some important questions and also introduces new challenges for the security of systems and processes and the privacy of individuals, such as their location and movements and so on. In this paper, at first, we propose a distributed IoT system architecture. Subsequently, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme, which can ensure some of the notable properties, such as sensor anonymity, sensor untraceability, resistance to replay attacks, cloning attacks, and so on. It is argued that the proposed authentication scheme will be useful in many distributed IoT applications (such as radio-frequency identification-based IoT system, Biosensor-based IoT healthcare system, and so on), where the privacy of the sensor movement is greatly desirable.},

abstract={Just like the internet, Internet of things (IoT) with right standards and technologies, will impact multiple aspects of human lives including Smart Home, Smart Car and Healthcare. Healthcare of things (HoT) would enhance healthcare using the insight provided by sensor data. Healthcare users will subscribe to HoT services that use sensors to get activity data (such as steps walked, hours slept and so on) along with other health vitals (such as heart rate, temperature and weight) to improve user's health. Similarly Smart home users subscribe to a Smart home cloud service that will use data from home sensors. Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers. In this demonstration, we highlight how user experience perspectives impact the data framework design in MPMC environments, using our drops data framework infrastructure. We hope to have these concepts included IoT standardization efforts. This demonstration was also made at CES at the IEEE booth.},

abstract={A novel Internet of Things based architecture supporting scalability and fault tolerance for healthcare is presented in this paper. The wireless system is constructed on top of 6LoWPAN energy efficient communication infrastructure to maximize the operation time. Fault tolerance is achieved via backup routing between nodes and advanced service mechanisms to maintain connectivity in case of failing connections between system nodes. The presented fault tolerance approach covers many fault situations such as malfunction of sink node hardware and traffic bottleneck at a node due to a high receiving data rate. A method for extending the number of medical sensing nodes at a single gateway is presented. A complete system architecture providing a quantity of features from bio-signal acquisition such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Electromyography (EMG) to the representation of graphical waveforms of these gathered bio-signals for remote real-time monitoring is proposed.},

abstract={Identification system[s], especially Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) system[s] played an important role in the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), and thus its popularity has increased in many industries at an unprecedented rate. GS1 EPCglobal has led the development of RFID standards from unique identifier, communication protocol to event repository. Recently, its scope starts to broaden with the new standard of EPC Information Service (EPCIS v1.1), while GS1 EPCglobal had focused on RFID middleware in the field of supply chain management (SCM). We believe that EPCIS can act as an event-based context repository for IoT. However, the challenges of scalability and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from a variety of sources. In this paper, we propose the novel open source platform complying with the EPCIS v1.1 specification called Oliot EPCIS, which can collect and share event data for a broad range of IoT applications. The main contribution of the paper is as follows. To resolve the challenges, we propose the scalable and flexible EPCIS architecture, the document-based model of EPCIS event and the new event called SensorEvent. We show that Oliot EPCIS generally outperforms two existing solutions through the comparative experiment. Also, with the healthcare case study, we show that Oliot EPCIS can capture and share sensor values requiring a very intensive data rate based on SensorEvent.},

These devices are expected to employ Constrained Application Protocol for the integration of such applications with the Internet, which includes User Datagram Protocol binding with Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol to provide end-to-end security. This paper presents a framework called BlinkToSCoAP, obtained through the integration of three software libraries implementing lightweight versions of DTLS, CoAP and 6LoWPAN protocols over TinyOS. Furthermore, a detailed experimental campaign is presented that evaluates the performance of DTLS security blocks. The experiments analyze BlinkToSCoAP messages exchanged between two Zolertia Z1 devices, allowing evaluations in terms of memory footprint, energy consumption, latency and packet overhead. The results obtained indicate that securing CoAP with DTLS in Internet of Things is certainly feasible without incurring much overhead.},

abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have recently been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit. The results and discussion show the validity and performance of our system.},

In the diverse kinds of networks, wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN construction scheme that is consists of 4 operations, the clustered topology setup, mobility support, and transmission efficiency enhancement. As an auxiliary benefit, the proposed scheme achieves an energy efficient feature by reducing the number of total control messages. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed scheme remarkably improves the performance of WBAN.},

When new technologies (like Smart Grid or Smart Energy) appear two types of challenges can be defined: technical and business challenges, therefore innovation has to be applied in both of them. Too often innovation is focus on the technical evolution and underestimated on the business field, however it is a key aspect for new technologies and services to reach commercial success. Traditional business models in the energy sector will suffer big changes in the next years, as the Smart Grid concept is developed. By the advent of new services and applications, horizontal and vertical partnerships with competitors and other actors will take place.

The paper presents an open, flexible, wireless and portable platform for monitoring vital signs in the healthcare scenarios, both indoor and outdoor. The platform has been designed in order to overcome the limitations of well-known technologies for mobile architectures, such as the battery lifetime and the lack of the open source codes. To reduce these issues the platform integrates the fast, easy-to-use, safe and low-power Near Field Communication protocol for data transmission in proximity, addressing the Internet of Things paradigm. The platform uses the Arduino NANO board and the related open source software libraries, so it could be possible to add new functionalities in a fast way.

abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},

abstract={The focus on this paper is to build an Android platform based mobile application for the healthcare domain, which uses the idea of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. We have built an application called 'ECG Android App' which provides the end user with visualization of their Electro Cardiogram (ECG) waves and data logging functionality in the background. The logged data can be uploaded to the user's private centralized cloud or a specific medical cloud, which keeps a record of all the monitored data and can be retrieved for analysis by the medical personnel. Though the idea of building a medical application using IoT and cloud techniques is not totally new, there is a lack of empirical studies in building such a system. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of IoT. Further, the paper presents an infrastructure for the healthcare domain, which consists of various technologies: IOIO microcontroller, signal processing, communication protocols, secure and efficient mechanisms for large file transfer, data base management system, and the centralized cloud. The paper emphasizes on the system and software architecture and design which is essential to overall IoT and cloud based medical applications. The infrastructure presented in the paper can also be applied to other healthcare domains. It concludes with recommendations and extensibilities found for the solution in the healthcare domain.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a major paradigm shift from traditional Internet applications that connects things / objects to the Internet for automatic sensing, information processing, understanding, reasoning, decision and response to virtual and physical world. Due to its highly distributed and heterogeneous characteristics, it requires more semantic interactions between different scenarios. Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions. We have preliminarily implemented the OntoIoT framework and domain extension in selected scenarios of smart space and healthcare. A data-driven and other ontology evaluation approaches are used to prove the scalability and interoperability of OntoIoT. Result demonstrates that, compared to other test ontologies, Onto IoT is more suitable for the given application scenario.},

abstract={The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), the IEEE 802.15.4 standard introduces wireless sensor network (WSN) from personal area network (PAN) into low power personal area network (LoWPAN). Hence, the use of Internet Protocol (IP) into LoWPAN has broadened new research area known as 6LoWPAN. Nowadays, 6LoWPAN technology is swiftly gaining recognition for its extensive application, ranging from healthcare to environmental monitoring. One of the challenges in 6LoWPAN is the route break often occurs due to node mobility, node failure and channel impairments. There are types of routing protocol that have been proposed to reroute or provide alternative routing to overcome the route break problem. However, the network is burdened of load RREQ the whole network. In this paper, we proposed LABC mechanism in the Local Route Repair using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm in 6LoWPAN network to enhance the routing against route breakage. We compare the packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay with scalable number of traffic and show that our routing protocol with LABC mechanism significantly reduce average end-to-end delay and increase number of packets delivery.},

The Internet, which has spanned several networks in a wide variety of domains, is having a significant impact on every aspect of our lives. The next generation of networks will utilize a wide variety of resources with significant sensing capabilities. Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will involve symbiotic networks of people (social networks), smart devices, and smart phones or mobile personal computing and communication devices that will form net-centric societies or cyber-physical social systems. These devices - and the network - will be constantly sensing, monitoring, and interpreting the environment; this is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things (IOT). The symbiosis of IOT and social networks will have significant implications for both the market for advanced computing and communication infrastructure and the future markets - for nearly 4.5 billion people - that net-centric societies will create. In this talk I will discuss a future vision for healthcare, which will involve smart phones, smart devices, and social networks, and will discuss computing technologies that make this vision a reality.},

pages={475-480},
abstract={The US healthcare Affordable Care Act established the 30 day readmission protection program as one of the base lines of measuring quality of care at hospitals and post discharge. With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.},

abstract={Physical objects with embedded sensors are increasingly being networked together using wireless and internet technologies to form Internet of Things (IoT). However, early applications that rely on IoT data fail to provide comprehensive situational awareness. This often requires combining physical (i.e., IoT) data with social data created by humans on the Web and increasingly on their mobile phones (i.e., citizen sensing) as well as other data such as structured open data and background knowledge available on the Web (i.e., cyber data and knowledge). In this paper, we explore how integration and analysis of multimodal physical-cybersocial data can support advanced applications and enrich human experience. Specifically, we illustrate the complementary role played by sensor and social data, often intermediated by other Web based data and knowledge, using real-world examples in the domain of situational awareness, traffic monitoring, and healthcare. We also show how semantic techniques and technologies support critical data interoperability needs, advanced computation capabilities including reasoning, and significantly enhance our ability to exploit growing amount of data from the proliferation of Internet of Things.},

This can be observed in the integration of connected sensors from a multitude of devices such as mobile phones, healthcare equipment, and vehicles. There is a need for the development of infrastructure support and analytical tools to handle IoT data, which are naturally big and complex. But, research on IoT data can be constrained by concerns about the release of privately owned data. In this paper, we present the design and implementation results of a synthetic IoT data generation framework.

abstract={The proliferation of the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology in the last decade shows its importance as effective solution for a large variety of application scenarios, such as monitoring, homeland security, healthcare, logistic and last but not the least Internet of Things. Actually, an accurate RFID modeling, optimization and performance analysis via simulation is strongly desired. In this paper, the authors propose two innovations of tag anti-collision algorithm in EPC Gen 2 RFID Specification: i. the adaptive management of Q-parameter (to maximize the efficiency of the inventory procedure depending on the tags number) and its communication by a QueryAdjust command, and ii. the muting option, which silences the tags after their identification with the effect of reducing the offered load to the reader after each successful identification.},

abstract={Nowadays, many researchers are interested in the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is evolving our knowledge and conception of the world. IoT aims to offer a common communication paradigm for all objects via the Internet and its protocols. For that reasons, it is being applied in all areas of life, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, military, cities management, and industry. One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN. An overview of the different management protocols for IPv6 is presented. Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and the considerations for IoT management from works such as Lightweight Network Management Protocol (LNMP), and the Constrained networks and devices Management (COMAN) Group from the IETF are discussed. COMAN is presenting solutions such as simplified MIB, new SNMP consideration, and CoAP-based management.},

abstract={Home and remote healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have great business potential in future. Despite enormous development in ICT and cloud computing, there is still some technology development needed before such services can be applied into practice and penetrate into markets. One of the key components for IoT based mobile healthcare is an accurate, low-cost, and user-friendly physiological monitoring device. In this study, such an intelligent, unobtrusive conformable, user friendly physiological monitoring device is presented. In particular, the inkjet printing of silver nano-particle ink, NPS-JL from Harima Chemicals, is used to fabricate interconnections and a 2.4 GHz antenna on low-cost stretchable plastics. Interconnections between RF SoC and passive components are made with isotropic conductive adhesive. Finally, the platform is demonstrated as a `plaster' like sensor node that measures the ECG signal and transmits that in real-time to a mobile device using Bluetooth low-energy protocol. Up to 14 m reading distance was demonstrated using the printed antenna in a close vicinity of the body.},

title={An architecture for customer experience management based on the Internet of Things},
year={2014},
volume={58},
number={5/6},
pages={15:1-15:11},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a commerce-related architecture, the Smarter Commerce Customer Engagement Architecture (SCCEA). This architecture involves a new definition of the commerce lifecycle and an alternative metric for calculating customer experience and benefit, called customer lifetime benefit (CLB). Traditionally, commerce-related architectures have enabled the direct involvement and interaction between customers and companies from a purchasing, customer support center, or marketing perspective. These systems typically help measure financial success through the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric. SCCEA represents a shift in approaches from these architectures to one focused on the interactions with the products customers own and on how those products are operating. SCCEA analyzes the data gathered directly from the operations of products to make a determination of what actions can be taken to positively influence customer experience. SCCEA is realized through combining three foundational domains: Smarter Commerce™, Internet of Things, and Customer Engagement. The paper begins with a definition of the commerce lifecycle, followed by an overview of the three foundational domains. With this foundation established, the authors describe the SCCEA architecture, subsystems, and functional components. Finally, to help clarify the feasibility of the SCCEA approach, a representative scenario from the healthcare industry is presented.},

pages={1903-1910},
abstract={Social persuasion to influence the actions, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals, embedded in a social network, has been widely studied. It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.},

abstract={Evolving from a mature body of research titled SoundScapes, this paper reports on a work-in-progress that is investigating the need that is evident for improved information and recommendation infrastructures to assist in healthcare intervention and communication (including apparatus and method). The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters. Through dissemination of the concept at this early phase of development in establishing the resource, an open invitation for peers and related interested parties to critique, advise, and otherwise contribute toward optimal development and wide impact - s offered.},

abstract={Cloud computing and Internet of things (IOT) technologies can support a new generation of PHR systems which are provided as cloud services that contain patient data (health and social) from various sources, including automatically transmitted data from Internet connected devices of patient living space (e.g. medical devices connected to patients at home care). In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},

abstract={The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it possible for connecting various smart objects together through the Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to become a technology revolution with a vision of creating very large scale network, comprising of unprecedented number of connected devices. These devices, often referred to as smart items or intelligent things can be home appliances, healthcare devices, vehicles, buildings, factories and almost anything networked and fitted with sensors, actuators, embedded computers. There has been sustained research work and standardization effort from different IoT perspectives like integration of sensor and RFID devices to the Internet. With the increasing trend of gathering business insights from unstructured data, the high volume of data generated by such devices is also of interest. Cloud based data mining platforms are suitable for analyses of such data and researchers have proposed architectures where personal mobile phones can act as Edge Gateway between the sensor network and cloud analytics platform. It seems that the surge in the volume of data generated by huge number of Smart Items can only be matched if a large percentage of mobile users start sharing the computation capability of their personal devices and work together towards true Participatory Computing in the IoT systems. In this work we try to understand the challenges associated with running computation jobs on the mobile devices using different types of workload often observed in IoT applications. Based on the insights gained from experiments performed by us, we propose a scheme where mobile phones, residential gateways and other edge devices offer free slots to servers in a cloud based data analytics system. Based on the free time slots offered by the mobile phones, if commensurately sized computational jobs can be scheduled, the unpredictability associated with using mobile phones as grid resources can be solved.},

abstract={The Internet of Things, more specifically, the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) standard enables machines and devices such as sensors to communicate with each other without human intervention. The M2M devices provide a great deal of M2M data, mainly used for specific M2M applications such as weather forecasting, healthcare or building automation. Existing applications are domain-specific and use their own descriptions of devices and measurements. A major challenge is to combine M2M data provided by these heterogeneous domains and by different projects. It is really a difficult task to understand the meaning of the M2M data to later reason about them. We propose a semantic-based approach to automatically combine, enrich and reason about M2M data to provide promising cross-domain M2M applications. A proof-of-concept to validate our approach is published online (http://sensormeasurement.appspot.com/).},

abstract={As Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a growing reality, more ubiquitous devices are embedded in our daily lives, serving us in a broad range of purposes in everyday life from: personal healthcare to home automation to tailored smart city services. These devices primarily collect data that is about or produced by people, be it street noise level of a neighbourhood, or the energy footprint of an individual's home or her location and other situational context. As this unprecedented amount of data is collected, we are challenged with one fundamental research question: who owns this data and who should have access to it? Specifically, the emergent of the Human Data Interaction (HDI) topic which aims to put the human at the centre of the data driven industry, calls attention to the IoT community to address the data ownership aspect more carefully. In this note, we offer a reflection on the challenges that IoT faces in regards to the data ownership in HDI and advocate the roles that both ordinary people and industries must play to best answer those challenges in shaping the IoT landscape.},

Such power load data are available from smart meters that will be widely deployed in many countries by utilities or customers, creating an infrastructure at the forefront of the Internet of Things (IoT). The main contribution of this work is a time-dependent factorial hidden Markov model to extract behaviour related features linked with individual appliance usage. The results show that the introduced time-dependent structure can improve the performance while also provide a probability distribution related to ADLs. These results further provide a promising indication of appliance usage connotations of e-health, and a foundation for further research.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare (U-healthcare) systems are expected to offer flexible and resilient high-end technological solutions enabling remote monitoring of patients health status in real-time and provisioning of feedback and remote actions by healthcare providers. In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},

The emerging pervasive healthcare enabled by the Internet-of-Things offers promising solutions. In addition, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS) is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demands for daily monitoring and on-site diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive medication management solution is proposed based on intelligent and interactive packaging (I2Pack) and intelligent medicine box (iMedBox). The intelligent pharmaceutical packaging is sealed by the Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by wireless communication. Various vital parameters can also be collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the wireless link. On-site diagnosis and prognosis of these vital parameters are supported by the high performance architecture. Additionally, friendly user interface is emphasized to ease the operation for the elderly, disabled, and patients. A prototyping system of the I2Pack and iMedBox is implemented and verified by field trials.},

abstract={In-home healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have great business potentials. To turn it into reality, a business ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should therefore aim for a cooperative ecosystem by meeting the interoperability, security, and system integration requirements. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform-based in-home healthcare terminal. A cooperative business ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. To support the ecosystem in practical technology and business development, ecosystem-driven standardization efforts, security mechanisms, terminal design principles, and data handling schemes are analyzed and corresponding solutions or guidelines are presented. Thirdly, to verify the proposed design strategy and guidelines, an open-platform-based terminal is implemented and demonstrated by a prototyping system.},

abstract={In recent years healthcare industry, including here also the payers entities, pharmaceutical companies and other members of the ecosystem, shows a tremendous interest and potential for the usage of wireless sensors in various instances and for different purposes. As the utilization cases are very numerous we questioned if the number of applications is similarly large. In order to run this study we start establishing a classification of the use-cases and populate it with main scenarios used in healthcare. We found that despite a reasonably large taxonomy, applications use a low number of solutions with variations and add-ons. The main use-case is by far Remote Patient Monitoring that can be found together with some variations in the large majority of the studied scenarios and this is the use-case detailed below. The overall landscape is covered in a PhD thesis that approaches additional Internet-of-Things usage and benefits in healthcare.},

abstract={The current emphasis on sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems, more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems”, has the potential to give rise to a new generation of systems and services encompassing several domains such as e-Governance, healthcare, transportation, waste management, energy & utilities, insurance, etc., resulting in the metamorphosis of the Internet as we see it, into the Internet of Things (IoT). One probable commonality in each of these services will be the abundance of different types of data from different sources with the success of the systems depending on real-time or near real-time analysis of data. Such analyses are normally performed via well-known algorithms with a time-constraint on the execution, thus creating a requirement for parallel execution techniques. Some of these analyses may have a higher frequency of execution on a relatively small set of data, in which case the current big-data frameworks may actually add an overhead. Further, the frameworks like Hadoop demand the algorithms to be mapped onto a particular paradigm, which may not always be a suitable option. This paper, which is a work-in-progress, provides an experience report on the use of Condor, a well known Grid framework, for data-parallel “black-box” style execution of analysis algorithms in the context of Internet of Things. We concentrate on algorithms which are already in use, and can be partitioned into data-parallel subtasks without any modification and use Condor, which has traditionally been used for high-performance or high-throughput computing, as the execution framework.},

This paradigm has the potential to revolutionize global industry and daily life. Healthcare is once such industry where the Internet of Things may provide great advantages to patients, care givers, and medical institutions. As the number of radio frequency emitters increases under this new paradigm public health and safety must also be taken into account. This paper explores the electromagnetic interference on implantable cardiac rhythm management devices caused by RFID interrogators. A standard electromagnetic compatibility test framework is proposed in order to diagnose the possibility of interference. Also, a mitigation method is proposed and tested. It is shown that the proposed method can reduce the incidence of clinically significant interference by nearly 60%.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},

abstract={Smart community is an emerging Internet of Things application. It supports a variety of high-value automated services such as pervasive healthcare through a multi-hop community network of smart homes in a local residential region. In this paper, we study privacy preserving data communication between patients and an online healthcare provider (referred to as vendor) for efficient remote healthcare monitoring (RHM) in a smart community environment. We adopt patients' attribute structures instead of their identities for authentication and preserve identity privacy during patient-to-vendor communication, and we build a receiver chain among smart homes to enable vendor-to-patient communication and achieve location privacy. The privacy preserving properties of the proposed data communication scheme are analyzed, and its effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through extensive simulations.},

abstract={A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.},

abstract={In Europe, in a context of growing population and decreasing resources, ageing related diseases represent one of the most relevant challenges in terms of healthcare organization complexity, plus care levels and system financing balancing. Nowadays there are several researches that are studying the application of the IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm in the e-health field. This paper explains how a solution, built on the top of the VIRTUS IoT middleware, provides a valid alternative to current IoT solutions, which are mainly based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). VIRTUS leverage an Instant Messaging protocol (XMPP) to guarantee a (near) real-time, secure and reliable communication channel among heterogeneous devices. The presented development has been exploited in a healthcare case study: an implementation of a cost-savvy remote body movement monitoring system, aimed at classify daily patients' activities, designed as a modular architecture and deployed in a large scale scenario. The paper analyzes the features offered by the VIRTUS middleware, if used within a e-health solution, providing a comparison with other well-known systems.},

abstract={After the burst of the dot-com bubble in the Fall of 2001, the Internet has become a participative medium, which allows users to interact with one another and with the services from anywhere and at any time. The potential of such a change is still to be fully exploited, and phenomena such as social networks and cloud computing are just two of the many innovative solutions that have been born from the Web 2.0. At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality. Finally, we describe a typical HealthCare application for the IoT realized using WebIoT.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and evolving concept that provides connectivity to the Internet via sensing devices to achieve intelligent identification and management in a heterogeneous connectivity environment. From the assisted living perspective, this emerging concept will enable new communication connectivity routes between elderly disabled patient and care services through innovative networking architectures in AAL environments. M-health is defined as "mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care" [1]. This evolutionary concept provides both mobility and 'always connected' functionalities for different healthcare applications. In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services. In this paper we will present a general m-IoT architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology for measurement of body temperature as an example for healthcare application.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework.},

abstract={Providing effective and appropriate healthcare is one of the most important objectives of information and communication technologies (ICT). Internet of things (IoT) is one of the last advances in ICT, providing a global connectivity and management of sensors, devices, users and information. Our contribution is a solution to examine drug related problems based on IoT technologies, i.e. smart phones and Web to support ubiquitous Access, 6LoWPAN technology to support ubiquitous data collection of patients, sensors and hospitals, and RFID/NFC to support global identification. These technologies offer a wide range of applications in healthcare, which improves the quality of services, reduce mistakes, and even detect health anomalies from vital signs. This paper presents how IoT technology is applied in a pharmaceutical system to examine drugs in order to detect Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR), harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, complications and contraindications related with liver and renal defects, and harmful side effects during pregnancy or lactation. Thereby, the system provides an enhanced approach assisting physicians in clinical decisions and drug prescribing. The solution presented is based on NFC (Near Field Communication) and barcode identification technologies, which have been integrated in common devices such as smart-phones, PDAs and PCs. The drug ID is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a specific drug is suitable with respect to the patient's health record or not.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

abstract={Recently the problem of providing effective and appropriate healthcare to elderly and disable people is an important field in relative to the aging of population problems. The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},

abstract={In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such valida- ions span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of Dny for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental conce},

abstract={Summary form only given. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is a novel design paradigm, envisioned as a network of billions or trillions of machines communicating with one another and rapidly gaining global attention from academia, industry, and government. Pervasive computing is at the heart of IoT and forms a fundamental building block necessary to realize the IoT. Equipped with pervasive technologies such as RFID and ‘smart dust’ in addition to sensors, actuators and machine-to-machine devices, IoT has the potential to offer innovative solutions to global challenges faced by ageing populations, climate change, growing cost of healthcare as well as how we manage our environment and natural resources. The heterogeneous nature of the IoT as well as the computational constraints of many of the building blocks of the IoT make security, privacy and trust a challenging problem to solve on the one hand, while security, privacy and trust play a critical role for most if not all applications of IoT in domains such as surveillance, healthcare, security, transport, food safety, manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management. Without effective solutions for security, privacy and trust reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-aware intelligence and enhanced user acceptance and experience cannot be achieved.},

abstract={The recent spectacular progress in the microelectronic, information, communication, material and sensor technologies created a big stimulus towards development of smart communicating cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS connected to Internet started to form the Internet of Things (IoT) that is undergoing an explosive growth. In 2013 there were approximately 12.1 billion internet-connected devices, and their number is expected to more than quadruple to nearly 50 billion devices by 2025. Modern mobile systems constitute a very important subclass of CPS. Examples of such systems include automotive and transportation systems, mobile equipment transported by people or animals (including wearable or implantable systems), mobile robots, etc. For the CPS and IoT chip market as high as 30% annual growth rate is predicted for the period 2013-2020 (Gartner, Oct. 2014) that will be mainly driven by the need for low-power embedded processing, communications and sensing for mobile CPS sectors like smart automotive, wireless communication and wearables, with smart healthcare wearables growing at 65% a year to $41 billion in 2020 (Soreon Research, Oct. 2014).},

abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain an- the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},

abstract={The current development of computational intelligence reminds the author of late 1980s and early 1990s when there were tremendous excitements and opportunities for computational intelligence research and applications. We are entering the second golden period for computational intelligence development, because effective and efficient solutions to many of today's grand challenges in e-healthcare, smart cities, internet-of-things, Big Data, etc., require better, faster and cheaper computational intelligence algorithms, methods and techniques. These new challenges pose new research questions that can stimulate the rapid growth of our research field. There are huge opportunities for all of us to contribute to developing novel computational intelligence solutions to these challenges. Why not share your ideas and experiences in tackling difficult real-world problems with the wider communities and submit your work to one of the CIS journals? Authors who had a paper recently presented at WCCI'14 might be interested in taking the feedback they got at the Congress, extending the work further and submitting an extended paper to a CIS journal. They are here encouraged to let the world know of any novel ideas and contributions.},

abstract={The Internet has experienced a tremendous growth in the past three decades, evolving from a network of a few hundred hosts to a platform linking billions of "things" globally, including individual people as well as enterprises of various sizes, through computers and computerized devices of any conceivable size and capability and the applications running on them. The growth of the Internet shows no signs of slowing down and it steadily becomes the cause of a new pervasive paradigm in computing and communications. This new paradigm enhances the traditional Internet into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) created around intelligent interconnections of diverse objects in the physical world, such as vehicles, cell phones, habitats, and habitat occupants. It utilizes low-cost information gathering and dissemination devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, that facilitate fast-paced interactions among the objects themselves as well as the objects and persons in any place and at any time. IoT will usher in a wide range of smart applications and services to cope with many of the challenges individuals and organizations face in their everyday lives. For example, remote healthcare monitoring systems could aid in managing costs and alleviating the shortage of healthcare personnel; intelligent transportation systems could aid in reducing traffic congestion and inevitably the ills caused by it such as air pollution; smart distribution systems from utility grids to supply chains could aid in improving the quality and reducing the cost of their respective goods and services; tagged objects could result in more systematic recycling and effective waste disposal, and so on.},

year={2016},
volume={4},

pages={8407-8417},
abstract={This paper describes a mixed-signal electrocardiogram (ECG) system for personalized and remote cardiac health monitoring. The novelty of this paper is fourfold. First, a low power analog front end with an efficient automatic gain control mechanism, maintaining the input of the ADC to a level rendering optimum SNR and the enhanced recyclic folded cascode opamp used as an integrator for ΣΔ ADC. Second, a novel on-the-fly PQRST boundary detection (BD) methodology is formulated for finding the boundaries in continuous ECG signal. Third, a novel low-complexity ECG feature extraction architecture is designed by reusing the same module present in the proposed BD methodology. Fourth, the system is having the capability to reconfigure the proposed low power ADC for low (8 b) and high (12 b) resolution with the use of the feedback signal obtained from the digital block when it is in processing. The proposed system has been tested and validated on patient's data from PTBDB, CSEDB, and in-house IIT Hyderabad Data Base (IITHDB) and we have achieved an accuracy of 99% upon testing on various normal and abnormal ECG signals. The whole system is implemented in 180-nm technology resulting in 9.47-μW (at 1 MHz) power consumption and occupying 1.74-mm2 silicon area.},

abstract={In this brief, we propose a low-complexity architectural implementation of the K-means-based clustering algorithm used widely in mobile health monitoring applications for unsupervised and supervised learning. The iterative nature of the algorithm computing the distance of each data point from a respective centroid for a successful cluster formation until convergence presents a significant challenge to map it onto a low-power architecture. This has been addressed by the use of a 2-D Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer-based low-complexity engine for computing the n-dimensional Euclidean distance involved during clustering. The proposed clustering engine was synthesized using the TSMC 130-nm technology library, and a place and route was performed following which the core area and power were estimated as 0.36 mm2 and 9.21 mW at 100 MHz, respectively, making the design applicable for low-power real-time operations within a sensor node.},

abstract={Nowadays state of the art health care systems are either based on hospital or household environs and its scope is confined to urban areas of a country. Yet traditional healthcare systems are facing challenges such as lack of ubiquity, use of backdated techniques, inadequacies in tracking, observing and reporting status of patients and diseases as well as unaffordability. However, modern updates in IoT, cloud computing, mobile and web development and computer vision technology are offering us a wider scope in providing an effective health care system to everyone. The assistance includes automation in systematic monitoring of patients, transmission of medical data at real-time, saving those data in cloud servers, manipulate data for future use, presenting real time scenario to stake holders and many more. Here we suggest a wireless network infrastructure that will provide useful health and medical services to children and adults as well as assist in distributing vaccines, tablets and personnel to monitor endemic diseases. We have two components in our system, first one is the clinic booth accompanied by health workers. This system assists health workers in their work and acquire personalized data and sends them to an online server for future use. Second is the administration and presentation of the ground data to stake holders. In our preliminary network evaluation of the IoT powered clinic booth design we found average response time of 1.5 seconds with uptime of 98.16%.},

However, at this moment there aren't any satisfying technologies or approaches for precise indoor positioning. This paper proposes an indoor positioning method based on trilateration using Wi-Fi RSSI measurements with corrections to eliminate the noise and the bias. The proposed method is tested in a laboratory environment and results are described.},

abstract={The network mobility (NEMO) management for a mobile network of IPv6 low-power personal area network (6LoWPAN) in smart buildings has attracted much interest recently, this is partly due to the emergence of the internet of things (IoT). For the specific case of hospital environments, NEMO provides continued connectivity with the Internet for patients attached with 6LoWPAN mobile nodes (MNs) regardless of patients' locations. NEMO comprises a set of mobile network nodes (MNNs) that could move together as a single unit, and each of these mobile networks has a mobile router (MR) that can change its attachment point to the Internet as the network moves together. Even though NEMO has a low signaling cost, but there is a need to understand their challenges for a 6LoWPAN mobile network in smart buildings. If the MR loses its energy, the connectivity with the network will be lost. In this paper, to illustrate the challenges of NEMO in smart buildings like hospital environments, the traffic load at MR will be evaluated against the number of MNNs, number of handovers, and data arrival rate. This has been simulated by OMNet++4.3.1 and Contiki.},

title={Uncertainty Investigation for Personalised Lifelogging Physical Activity Intensity Pattern Assessment with Mobile Devices},
year={2017},
volume={},

pages={871-876},
abstract={Lifelogging physical activity (PA) assessment is crucial to healthcare technologies and studies for the purpose of treatments and interventions of chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies. Whilst PA activity monitoring by mobile phone is still a challenging issue by far due to much more uncertainties than wearable devices.},

pages={851-857},
abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a framework that is mostly used in industrial applications such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing and it is not immune from potential future hacking. By carrying out various types of cyber-attacks, hackers can disrupt the normal operation of a robot. It is easy to get control of communication between a robot and a human due to the open communication network after carrying out malicious attacks to jam the network. As a result, hackers can change commands which are sent by an operator to the robot, making usual activities impossible. For instance, in a case of ROS hacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojans, backdoor attacks, and so on, can change the behaviour of robots to something completely different than expected.Therefore, forensic analysts require a specific method to forensically investigate ROS. This is a new area in the computer forensics field. Therefore, it is proposed to create an analytical framework to facilitate the forensic investigation of the Robot Operating System and methodologies and standards for acquiring related digital evidence using forensic tools. This study addresses a formalized and structured methodology that would assist the forensic investigation approach.This research will help to enhance the gathering, identification and preservation of evidence related to forensics investigations of the Robot Operating System. The forensic analysts could adapt the examination procedure of hacked ROS with a focused, crime-specific, forensics framework.},

pages={293-298},
abstract={Designing efficient strategies of reducing health care costs and optimizing facility utilization has long be a pursue of health systems, and stratifying patients into different expenditure/utilization patterns and further profiling these patient groups can provide useful clues for the strategy design. In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases. Overall, this study can usefully promote the development of healthcare-strategy design and implementation.},

pages={863-870},
abstract={The advances in sensor technology over recent years has provided new ways for researchers to monitor the elderly in uncontrolled environments. Sensors have become smaller, cheaper and can be worn on the body, potentially creating a network of sensors. Smart phones are also more common in the average household and can also provide some behavioural analysis due to the built in sensors. As a result of this, researchers are able to monitor behaviours in a more natural setting, which can lead to more useful data. This is important for those that may be suffering from mental illness as it allows for continuous, non-invasive monitoring in order to diagnose symptoms from different behaviours. However there are various challenges that need to be addressed ranging from issues with sensors to the involvement of human factors. It is vital that these challenges are taken into consideration along with the major behavioural symptoms that can appear in an Elderly Person. For a person suffering with Dementia, the application of sensor technologies can improve the quality of life of the person and also monitor the progress of the disease through behavioural analysis. This paper will consider the behaviours that can be associated with dementia and how these behaviours can be monitored through sensor technology. We will also provide an insight into some sensors and algorithms gathered through survey in order to provide advantages and disadvantages of these technologies as well as to present any challenges that may face future research.},

abstract={Mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs) have arisen as a very promising brandnew healthcare system, which will greatly improve the quality of life. Moreover, with the help of Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any Trusted Third Party (TTP). Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching. Finally, we do comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world smartphones to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed schemes.},

abstract={Healthcare industry has proven its technically abundant applications at par other industries with the help of many concepts like IoT and cloud computing. It has transformed its techniques by using intelligent gadgets that can be acquainted with patients in different configurations. The data obtained from devices like pulse rate monitors, weighing scales, blood glucose measuring devices, etc. is to be stocked and tracked as awareness of health statistics is vital for all. A hefty portion of these measures requires a follow-off with a specialist. This commences the preference of using IoT based smart devices to deliver more valuable data to the patient and drop off the necessity for direct patient-doctor interaction. Improving the standard of service, it brings particularly high value for the patients requiring constant supervision and quick data access and analysis. This paper will demonstrate automatic communication between the smart devices and android mobile application via Bluetooth and data storage on Cloud. Also, it shows automatic control over oxygen cylinder using mobile app for admitted patients who require supplementary oxygen. Thus, our system serves the purpose of minimizing doctors' efforts and providing seamless experience to the patient with IoT, Cloud and Wireless Technology like Bluetooth helping in saving millions of lives.},

abstract={The last decade has witnessed tremendous efforts to shape the internet of thing (IoT) platforms to be well suited for healthcare applications. These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multi-channel EEG signals as well as a designed sparsifying basis to increase the sparsity of the EEG signal to improve the reconstruction quality, hence, increase the efficiency of the system.},

abstract={Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of death and disability with over 3.8 million annual cases and 130 daily deaths in the United States alone. Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.},

The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe.

abstract={It is indeed a fast pace world today. People and technology are both growing at a speed that you can never think of. With work soon becoming priority to many individuals; we tend to neglect the most important factor that helps us survive and conquer the world, our own health. It has always said that Health is Wealth. However, in the recent years people have been spending most of their hard-earned money in Hospitals and medicines. Thus, it proves our negligence towards our health. Not only that, but also many people are moving abroad leaving their old parents in their hometowns and not being able to keep a track of the health of each other. With this thought in our minds, we decided to do something that will make it easier for people to keep a track of their loved one's health as well as their own. With the evolution of internet everything is possible on it, from finding information to tracking locations nearby. Internet has become a savior for the world today. Internet of Things is taking a step ahead in helping the world be even more connected. Therefore, we decided on making an IoT based Health Monitoring System. The whole concept of it is to help people keep a track of their health and allow doctors to reduce the use of paper and maintain a database of their patients on the internet.},

abstract={The application of IoT has become widespread across several industries such as logistics, smart homes, smart cities, e-health, and agriculture. IOT based E-Health Systems provides healthcare services across a series of interconnected networks and IoT devices. In such type of systems data security remains to be the major issue as the data generated from the E-health systems are accessed by the variety of users for medication, diagnosis, and research purposes. Even an outbreak of the single GB of the health data creates serious impacts as they are highly confidential in nature. Thus, an effective security measure across the IoT-based E-health systems has become the primary requirement. Further, the underlying architecture of the IoT-based E-health systems also greatly influences the data management and security issues. In this paper, we review some of the security considerations and challenges of IOT based E-Health systems. The proposed research work suggests efficient architecture models and access control algorithms for IoT-based E-health systems. As a result, a comparative analysis of various architecture elements and security measures are discussed, and the most appropriate techniques are suggested.},

abstract={Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) is a practical cryptographic primitive for enforcing fine-grained attribute-based access control of personal health information (PHI) in mobile healthcare (mHealth) cloud. Existing schemes are either limited to restricted attribute universe or lack of efficient decryption algorithm for users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme for PHI in mHealth cloud. The proposed scheme simultaneously supports unbounded attribute universe and offers efficient decryption outsourcing approach without leaking the PHI privacy. It enables the PHI owner to define access policy in the form of any monotonic access structures. We prove the security in the standard model. Compared with relevant schemes, our scheme can reduce the user's decryption cost from increasing linearly with the number of attributes to constant.},

Nowadays, chronic illnesses, such as, stroke, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases are major causes of death, in many parts of the world. In this paper, we propose a patient monitoring system for stroke-affected people to minimize future recurrence of the same by alarming the doctor and caretaker on variation in risk factors of stroke disease. Data analytics and decision-making, based on the real-time health parameters of the patient, helps the doctor in systematic diagnosis followed by tailored restorative treatment of the disease.

abstract={Most current studies of epileptic seizure detection disclose that "Despite the design of new anti-epileptic drugs, drug resistant epilepsy still lacks an ultimate solution" [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'. This way a personalised monitoring plan (PMP) for each individual epilepsy patient can be realised.},

abstract={Advances in the information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Thing (IoT). IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all. This paper is a review of Healthcare Monitoring system using IoT.},

abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work develops the Alzimio mobile app, to provide safety functions to these patients; including safe-zone geofencing, activity-based alarms, take-me-home, navigate to nearest friend, and check-on-me. Six main design goals guided the design of Alzimio, including periodic safety checks, refined user control, flexibility and efficiency of alarms, and optimized operation, among others. Providing reliable continuous sensing and operation without drastically affecting battery lifetime provided a challenge. Such challenge is not unique to Alzimio, but is general to most IoT healthcare devices. Novel activity-recognition and geofencing algorithms are designed and optimized to meet the goals and overcome the challenge. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. Alzimio is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The phone was able to last throughout the day in our tests, which is very promising.},

abstract={United nation population report predicts that the world population will hit 8 billion by 2026 with hopping 1.5 billion in India. This increased population demands improved medical facilities only to realize there are not adequate doctors on role leading to deaths of nearly 1M Indians every year & approximately 700M deprived of even preliminary health treatment thereby carrying 21% of the global disease burden. In general, doctors are either not willing to serve the rural areas or they are not available 24×7 that is causing rural population to travel to cities even for casual ailments. According to WHO (World Health Organization) reports, India have less than 0.7 doctor /1000 population which is lower as compared to ratio of 4.3 in Russian federation, 3.8 in Argentina, 2.4 in USA & WHO Benchmark. Indian government spends just around 30% of the total budget in healthcare which is a penny in comparison to the USA & the UK. This increased population demands lower operational cost with high accuracy, early detection followed by prevention. In this paper, a futuristic approach is proposed to support the existing healthcare system by designing a preliminary multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair with E-diagnostic feature within a medical booth, analogous to an ATM booth. The attractive part of our system is low priced diagnosis, non-invasiveness, indigenously built medical apparatus, misdiagnosis prevention with fast systematic approach.},

Several solutions are proposed to resolve such problems, however, major difficulties they encounter are cost, comfort and performance. In this paper, we propose a new Android application for fall detection based on theory of machine learning and data mining. Concretely, we used a classification method to detect if it is a fall down or another common events (e.g. sitting, jumping, etc.).

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence. This paper presents the results of applying models to real clinical data. Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14). These models, classification models, should act in a DSS capable of helping to reduce this type of infections as well as reduce the costs associated with them.},

Our initial research showed that health-related mobile applications contain numerous vulnerabilities for attackers to potentially obtain medical data. In this paper, we propose a security framework for mobile applications in healthcare to address common security vulnerabilities that appear during the application development process.

abstract={Hospital inpatient care compromises one of the most demanding services in health institutions when providing a careful and continuous healthcare assistance. Such demands require constant update of the patients' electronic health record allied with support systems responsible for monitoring their clinical information. In this context, this paper presents a new web platform for daily monitoring of patients, designed to be used by health professionals, especially nurses. The application is based on React, an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

abstract={The emergence of IoT devices is revolutionizing various aspects of human life, including healthcare, where the use of such devices can potentially improve health outcomes for millions. However, the efficacy of treatments and protocols based on IoT devices is measured through the use of rigorous double-blind studies, which can be quite expensive to conduct as they traditionally require a third party mediator. In this paper, we propose CATnIP, a secure, centralized cloud hub for instrumenting and conducting double-blind studies, with an extended focus on seamless integration with IoT devices. This paper outlines the construction and security considerations of CATnIP, the motivations behind creating such a system, and an evaluation based on the Five Safes and Stakeholder frameworks.},

pages={2492-2495},
abstract={This letter proposes a novel privacy-aware “blind” cloud infrastructure to be utilized for storage, processing, and organization of health data. Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},

pages={9-14},
abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to - ake appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},

abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multi-organ failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user’s infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user’s mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

Validating context recognition in the wild is crucial to promote practical applications that work in real-life settings. The authors collected more than 300,000 minutes of sensor data with context labels from 60 subjects. Unlike previous studies, these subjects used their own personal phone, in any way that was convenient to them, and engaged in their routine in their natural environments. Unscripted behavior and unconstrained phone usage resulted in situations that were harder to recognize. The authors demonstrate how fusion of multimodal sensors is important for resolving such cases.

In AAL environment, there are plenty of ways to collect data about its inhabitants, such as through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The collected data are complicated enough to go for an efficient processing in perceiving the situation. This paper gives an overview of the existing research results in multimodal data analysis in AAL environment to improve the living environment of the seniors, and it attempts to bring efficiency in complex event processing for real-time situational awareness.

abstract={Advances in the information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Thing(IoT). IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed - such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all. This paper is a review of Healthcare Monitoring system using IoT.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are engineered solutions obtained through the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components. Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets. Some considerations about major measurement challenges that the CPS self-awareness feature - oses in maintenance and troubleshooting operations are then drawn. Concluding remarks are finally reported.},

It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration. Based on the type of data transmission; proactive or reactive, these devices will process and provide the data for the health monitoring company to take the correct action when patient's state of health moves outside normal range. Finally, the proposed model was simulated by using Packet tracer 7.},

abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},

abstract={Beginning with the recent availability of wireless medical sensor prototype and growing, the need for E-health care application record databases, we analyze the requirement of a unified communication framework over a fifth generation network. The introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) and latest developments or improvements in E-health, pointed towards the fifth generation (5G) paradigm of health care application and services. This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data. Further, we propose a protocol stack for 5G-CCN WBAN to provide a secure, efficient and reliable E-health application services to meet the required needs of the current IP protocol stack and IoT devices.},

abstract={PC4HC (Personalized Communication for Health Care) intends to create a communication platform tailored to people with multimorbidity and healthcare facilities that manage the care process. The project aims at: (1) Providing patients and healthcare facilities with a concise, clear and communicative interpretation of data from heterogeneous sources such as anamnestic, anthropometric, clinical and instrumental data (in particular, data obtainable from wearable sensors and so-called personal health systems). For this purpose, we plan to set up an infrastructure with high computational capabilities that is able to process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify new associations (Data Mining) between variables that can enrich communication and generate new knowledge. (2) Promoting a patient empowerment approach aimed at making the patient fully aware of the significance of a specific piece of information and the implications that it entails for the patient's state of health and wellbeing. To this end, we applied the principles of persuasive computing technology, i.e. technologies developed in order to influence and possibly modify habits and lifestyle choices through persuasion and awareness. (3) Implementing effective strategies to maintain health and a healthy lifestyle, as well as to provide integrated and optimized management of acute and chronic pathologies with an economic and social benefit for both individuals and the healthcare system. The platform, designed and developed to address multimorbidity, identifies as a validation scope an innovative model of personalized communication for people in dialysis treatment.},

abstract={In the last years, the emergence of pervasive connected devices and the development of the cloud computing paradigms brought a revolution in health-care and industrial applications. Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture.},

While ability to create and capture data is already here, the upcoming innovations will be in converting this big data into smart data through contextual and personalized processing such that patients and clinicians can make better decisions and take timely actions for augmented personalized health.

abstract={Recently, loT based healthcare systems have evolved as a tool to enhance the quality of life of people. This kind of system allows medical professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) to verify continuously the health conditions of their patients. As the healthcare systems manage highly sensitive physiological information of patients such as blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse, they are extremely vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care. In Gope-Hwang scheme, the authors proposed a lightweight anonymous authentication protocol and claimed that their scheme was secure. Unfortunately, this paper finds that Gope-Hwang scheme still has security pitfalls and limitations. This paper describes and cryptanalyzes the Gope-Hwang scheme to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security limitations. Then, it proposes an enhanced lightweight anonymous authentication scheme that solves the discovered security flaws. Additionally, this work executes security and performance analysis to demonstrate how the proposed protocol is more appropriate for a safe healthcare systems..},

abstract={Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},

Non-invasive, ambient sensors are retrieving data from patients being in their home care treatment setups. The type of sensors is limited to the tracking of inertia, motion, and alcohol gas. Low-cost sensor prototypes are developed. They constantly measure the movement and the air around the patients. The Big Data generated in this way is used to retrieve patterns of activities. Different pattern recognition algorithms are tested and compared. The highest accuracy and reliability in assessing the data are support vector machines and feedforward neural networks with a performance of 90 % probability in identifying the correct patients' activities over the test period.

abstract={Smart cities are becoming a reality. Various aspects of modern cities are being automated and integrated with information and communication technologies to achieve higher functionality, optimized resources utilization, and management, and improved quality of life for the residents. Smart cities rely heavily on utilizing various software, hardware, and communication technologies to improve the operations in areas, such as healthcare, transportation, energy, education, logistics, and many others, while reducing costs and resources consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT provides a platform for linking the cyber parts of a smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city, including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals, and other resources. Another useful technology is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable localized and real-time support for operating-enhanced smart city services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing is not an easy task. This paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing. We propose an SOM called SmartCityWare for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog Computing. SmartCityWare abstracts services and components involved in smart city applications as services accessible through the service-oriented model. This enhances integration and allows for flexible inclusion and utilization of the various services needed in a smart city application. In addition, we discuss the implementation and experimental issues of SmartCityWare and demonstrate its use through examples of smart city applications.},

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.},

Therefore, it is necessary of studying on dealing with the large-scale and complexity of personalized services in large-scale IoT-Based Healthcare application. In this paper, we propose proactive personalized service leveraging Complex Event Processing (CEP) to deal with a large number and complexity of personalized services. Firstly, personalized service defined as complex event pattern that expresses in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Secondly, we propose a complex event pattern partitioning and clustering algorithms to optimize the processing of dealing with personalized services.

abstract={Fog computing is considered as the most promising enhancement of the traditional cloud computing paradigm in order to handle potential issues introduced by the emerging Interned of Things (IoT) framework at the network edge. The heterogeneous nature, the extensive distribution and the hefty number of deployed IoT nodes will disrupt existing functional models, creating confusion. However, IoT will facilitate the rise of new applications, with automated healthcare monitoring platforms being amongst them. This paper presents the pillars of design for such applications, along with the evaluation of a working prototype that collects ECG traces from a tailor-made device and utilizes the patient's smartphone as a Fog gateway for securely sharing them to other authorized entities. This prototype will allow patients to share information to their physicians, monitor their health status independently and notify the authorities rapidly in emergency situations. Historical data will also be available for further analysis, towards identifying patterns that may improve medical diagnoses in the foreseeable future.},

abstract={The average age of the world's population is increasing, and life expectancy will increase by an extra 10 years by the year 2050. The growing number of older adults increases the demands on public health systems and the related care costs. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support integrated healthcare services in elderly homecare can make an important contribution to reducing such costs. The SOCIALIZE AAL project aims to create a new reference platform for the elderly by applying technological solutions to simplify their daily activities and the means by which they access dedicated services in order to improve their quality of life. This paper describes the Elderly Monitoring service - an IoT module of the SOCIALIZE platform, whose aim is to collect environmental and physical user data so that they can be supervised by medical and caregiver staffs. The system has been designed to enable easy addition and/or substitution of new services and devices within the environment. To this end, the service implements a framework that enables heterogeneous devices belonging to different domotic systems and protocols to directly share data, thereby implementing an infrastructure suitable for the fulfillment of a real Social IoT (SIoT).},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new loT-based health monitoring approach in which collected medical sensor data is sent to an analysis module via low-cost, low-power and secure communication links provided by a LoRaWAN network infrastructure. We mainly focus on monitoring blood pressure, glucose and temperature in rural areas where cellular network coverage is either absent or does not allow data transmission. The main objective is to reduce the burden of long trips for people living in these areas to visit healthcare facilities, while minimizing the communication cost. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the area covered by the LoRa network and the power consumption of our system. The results indicate that the average area covered is around 33 km2 when the LoRa Gateway is placed outdoor on a 12 meter altitude. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the power consumption of our monitoring system is at least ten times lower than other long range cellular solutions, such as GPRS/3G/4G.},

abstract={In-home IoT devices play a major role in healthcare systems as smart personal assistants. They usually come with a voice-enabled feature to add an extra level of usability and convenience to elderly, disabled people, and patients. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},

One of the key areas where this type of information can help to improve the quality of life is in healthcare since it allows to monitor and infer the current level of well-being of the smart devices carriers. In this paper, some of the available literature about well-being sensing through context-aware data is reviewed. Also, the main types of mechanisms used in these studies are identified.

Thus, the patient treatment can be performed in more efficient ways compared with traditional methods. Secure identification is a key system requirement for patients to acquire these health related services. Fast and convenient identification is important in the case of critical and elderly or disabled patients who required frequent health services. In this paper, we are presenting concept of the Naked environment where patients can get health services from smart and intelligent surroundings of hospital without using explicit gadgets. Patients would have direct interaction with the environment and get identified through it. We propose a biometric based authentication scheme for the Naked hospital environment that also protects the patients identity privacy. In addition, we show that this authentication scheme can resist various well known attacks such as insider attacks, replay attacks and identity privacy among others.},

abstract={In this paper, we are visualizing a military health service (MHS) platform which is based on hierarchical IoT architecture. We propose a semantic Edge based network model which plays a significant role for communicating tactical and non-tactical piece of information over the network. Further, the exchange of information and subsequent data analysis on the MHS makes the system intelligent and smart. In any standard battlefield scenario, there is a command and control center that correlates the events happening in real time. We have made this command and control center as semantic edge component. This center is entrusted with making vital decisions on the tactical arena of the battlefield. The main aim of the proposed architecture is to provide secured zone to monitor soldiers health and their weapons conditions, respectively. We have also introduced the semantic edge computing mechanism to deal with the large amount of health data in terms of processing, storing and sharing information.},

abstract={Internet of Things (loT) is a promising area which enables remote health monitoring. Providing timely notifications during emergency situations supports the remote monitoring. Processing and analysis of massive data generated is a challenge faced by health industry. The enormity of data generated through connected devices and analysis thereof is a bigger challenge for traditional data management systems. Cloud Computing is an assuring technology which endows services on demand for processing, storing and analyzing the data. In order to address these challenges Hadoop MapReduce framework is used for processing and balancing the scaled data that has been distributed on the network.

abstract={Fog computing is an architectural style in which network components between devices and the cloud execute application-specific logic. We present the first review on fog computing within healthcare informatics, and explore, classify, and discuss different application use cases presented in the literature. For that, we categorize applications into use case classes and list an inventory of application-specific tasks that can be handled by fog computing. We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud. These findings substantiate the need for a coherent approach toward fog computing in healthcare, for which we present a list of recommended research and development actions.},

abstract={Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising technology for realizing energy-efficient wireless sensors for long-term health monitoring. However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel signal quality-aware Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry system for continuous cardiac health monitoring applications. The proposed quality-aware ECG monitoring system consists of three modules: 1) ECG signal sensing module; 2) automated signal quality assessment (SQA) module; and 3) signal-quality aware (SQAw) ECG analysis and transmission module. The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches. This paper further shows that the transmission of acceptable quality of ECG signals can significantly improve the battery lifetime of IoT-enabled devices. The proposed quality-aware IoT paradigm has great potential for assessing clinical acceptability of ECG signals in improvement of accuracy and reliability of unsupervised diagnosis system.},

abstract={A device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network is pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications, since it is expected to bring the significant benefits of improving user throughput, extending the battery life of mobiles, etc. However, D2D and cellular communications in the same network may cause cross-tier interference (CTI) to each other. Also a critical issue of using D2D assisted cellular networks under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical equipments. In consideration of CTI and EMI, we study the problem of optimizing individual channel rates of the mobile users in different priorities (different levels of emergency) within the Internet of Vehicles for mobile health, and propose an algorithm of controlling the transmit power to solve the above-mentioned problem under a game-theoretical framework. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can converge linearly to the optimum, while ensuring an allowable level of EMI on medical equipments.},

abstract={Due to its abilities to capture real-time data concerning the physical world, the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon is fast gaining momentum in different applicative domains. Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},

abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},

abstract={The increasing popularity of wearable devices in recent years means that a diverse range of physiological and functional data can now be captured continuously for applications in sports, wellbeing, and healthcare. This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.},

abstract={Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has been a preferred encryption technology to solve the challenging problem of secure data sharing in cloud computing. The shared data files generally have the characteristic of multilevel hierarchy, particularly in the area of healthcare and the military. However, the hierarchy structure of shared files has not been explored in CP-ABE. In this paper, an efficient file hierarchy attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed in cloud computing. The layered access structures are integrated into a single access structure, and then, the hierarchical files are encrypted with the integrated access structure. The ciphertext components related to attributes could be shared by the files. Therefore, both ciphertext storage and time cost of encryption are saved. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be secure under the standard assumption. Experimental simulation shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient in terms of encryption and decryption. With the number of the files increasing, the advantages of our scheme become more and more conspicuous.},

abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},

abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).},

abstract={Advancements in medical imaging have revolutionized the way in which clinicians' approach diagnoses. From monitoring of disease to the treatment of illnesses is realized to be much more effective than ever before. The ability to exchange, connect and share information about human anatomy via non-invasive methods of radiology, nuclear medicine has opened up an entire new genre of medicine. Having said that, 'image distribution' in medical field has always been a challenge for the reasons known. And one primary parameter which always questions the very aspect of distribution has been 'Data Security and Patient Privacy'.The advances in technology and BYOD(Bring Your Own Devices) nature in the IOT industry has changed the paradigm of healthcare industry. In today's connected world it becomes increasing imperative to address aspects like 'data security, threat and patient privacy' and the 'risk mitigation' strategy within our products and solutions we offer. 'Prevention is better than cure' and history is the witness that no legislation has succeeded in totally eliminating security breaches from the globe. The only possible step is to adopt tight security implementation mechanisms and effective risk control measures in parallel to enhancing the privacy policies to combat the security attacks. In this paper we will see certain healthcare security lapses and what it means to stakeholders in the healthcare industry and an attempt to discuss few proven operational strategies, risk management methodologies and discern what the industry can do mitigate such security risks and privacy threats.},

title={Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario},
year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={99-104},
abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={171-176},
abstract={For the convenience of users, thousands of wearable devices with new built-in applications are appearing every year in the field of healthcare, sports, and safety. However, the system of them should be operated by using limited capacity of power because of very small size of battery that can be loaded into a wearable device due to the device properties. For such a reason, Chip Vendors are recently launching MCUs with ultra-low power capability on the market and also MCU that supports 7-step low power mode was appeared at present[1-3]. But now, it is very rare case to completely use Low Power Mode offered by MCU vendor on the operating system (OS) that is applied to wearable devices, and there is no case to support low power mode by the OS at the board level. Therefore, this paper suggests optimal supporting mechanism for ultra-low power multi-step mode at the OS level of wearable device. The mechanism proposed in this paper is largely divided into two parts. First, it is Low Power Mode Governor (LPMG) which is a module used to select an optimal low power mode after computation of retention time in idle mode. Second, we proposed Power-Off Mode, which disconnects power to the board when idle mode lasts for a long time. When integrating these two technologies and applying them to the Tickless nanoQplus[4], the OS for wearable devices developed at our lab, in the same Wearable Application Scenario 2 test, power consumption after passing a certain duration of time is reduced by 98.05% compared to idle mode, and 96.33% compared to sleep mode. These newly proposed two technologies will be able to offer an effective solution required to achieve low power consumption in wearable devices.},

abstract={Health and medical care are considered as one of the most fascinating applications that can fully benefit from the IoT deployment. In this work, we built a prototype of the Internet of Medical Things (IMedT) for monitoring cardiac activity in the form of phonocardiograph (PCG) signal. The prototype comprises of an agent and a manager. An agent runs a special task to collect heart sound signals and conditioning the signals. A manager, on the other hand, performs some tasks including: (i) gathering signal from some an agent or sensor node, (ii) operated as a web server to make the data available online locally and globally for doctors in order that the data can be accessed anywhere with certain authorization schemes, (iii) it is equipped with ability to do data mirroring to a data center in the cloud system in such a way that the most updated file can be copied to the targeted location to ensure the authorized healthcare providers and doctors anywhere around the globe to get the latest heart sound data for cardiac monitoring and diagnosing. Some issues regarding future development of the IMedT system were presented including smart diagnosis capability, security issues, and extension to the 6LoPAN as well as its compliance to the emerging 5G mobile networks.},

The prevalent rise of the mobile device and computational technology in the age of information technology offers exciting applications that are attributed to sophisticated, enormously reliable, and most mature CMOS-based electronics. We are accustomed to high performance, cost-effective, multifunctional, and energy-efficient scaled electronics. However, they are rigid, bulky, and brittle. The convolution of flexibility and stretchability in electronics for emerging Internet of Everything application can unleash smart application horizon in unexplored areas, such as robotics, healthcare, smart cities, transport, and entertainment systems. While flexible and stretchable device themes are being remarkably chased, the realization of the fully compliant electronic system is unaddressed. Integration of data processing, storage, communication, and energy management devices complements a compliant system. Here, a comprehensive review is presented on necessity and design criteria for freeform (physically flexible and stretchable) compliant high-performance CMOS electronic systems.},

Significant bio-medical signal including the electrocardiography (ECG) can be transferred with VLC even in places where RF is forbidden. This potential advantage of VLC could save more emergency patients. The time hopping scheme is adopted to transmit multiple medical data with keeping a simple system design. Multiple data streams go through an optical detector including a photodiode and multiple data are separated by TH demodulator at the receiver.

However, according to statistics reports, annual global mortality for cardiovascular diseases remained as high as 29%, of which coronary artery disease (CAD) is accounted for 42%. Unfortunately, almost half of the patients not knowing they are at risk of cardiovascular diseases until serious symptoms occurred. Here, we proposed an early warning system by integrating IoT, big data, and cloud computing technologies which physically linked among personal communication devices of patient/doctor, cloud systems, and hospital medical information systems. The system collects personal heart rate and metabolic equivalent (MET) features from calibrated fitness devices wore by users, and corresponding fitted curves are dynamically calculated and compared to previously trained curve patterns from 213 patients with heart diseases and 124 healthy individuals. The prototype system was already successfully developed and validated by a couple of testing cases with excellent performance. To ensure the robustness of the proposed system, now we are evaluating system reliability and trying to collect more testing samples for further validating effectiveness of the proactive healthcare mechanism.},

abstract={This paper presents a new approach for telepresence wheelchairs equipped with multiple cameras. The aim of this system is to provide effective assistance for the elderly and people with disabilities. The work explores the integration of the Internet of Things, such as multimedia, wireless Internet communication, and automation control techniques into a powered wheelchair system. In particular, multiple videos are streamed in real-time from an array of cameras mounted on the wheelchair, allowing wide visualization surrounding the wheelchair. By using video communication and interaction, remote users can assist to navigate a wheelchair via the Internet through wireless connections in a distant location. The experimental results show that video streaming can achieve high-quality video with the streaming rate up to 30 frames per second (fps) in real-time. The average round-trip time is under 27 milliseconds (ms). The results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed system for tele-monitoring and remote control to achieve safer navigation tasks for wheelchair users.},

abstract={Pervasive Computing also called as ubiquitous computing where computing is made available to anytime and anywhere. It is very fast growing innovative trends in the field of Internet of Thing (IOT). Context Awareness is key part of pervasive computing. Context aware computing it means act of both sensing data from sensor and react according to sensory data. Context is nothing but information about any entity. For representation of Context Awareness there is need of setting up context. For setting up or defining context there is need of different parameters. Based on that parameters context is defined. Proposed system is all about context aware middleware for Human Activity Recognition. The main idea of activity recognition is to recognize day to day common human activities in real life. As human activities are complex and highly diverse activity recognition is challenging task. Activity recognition means to analysis of human body activity. Those activities are recognized by different recognition techniques. Several algorithms based on probability distribution have been used for building activity model. Activity recognition is an important paradigm in ubiquitous computing whereas it can be applicable for real time healthcare system also.},

abstract={Increasing market demand for high performance and portable computing devices requires energy efficient devices. When a network of devices is considered, as in the case of the Internet of Things, it is important to consider low power design at the sensor/actuator level as well as in the sensor network. Human body communication has proven to be an efficient mode of communication for near field body sensor network applications. In this paper we propose an architecture for an ambulatory health monitoring system using a body coupled communication channel. The proposed architecture can be used for smart health monitoring as part of the Internet of Things. The design was validated using Simulink. A 31% power reduction was observed in the proposed monitoring system when human body communication was used.},

abstract={Fog computing brings cloud closer to end-users and data sources by enabling computation at the edge of the network. Low latency is the main benefit. IoT applications are often latency-sensitive. Such applications may be provisioned as component-based in a hybrid cloud/fog environment with components spanning cloud and fog. This will enable placing some of its components in the fog domain closer to the IoT devices, and consequently reduce the latency. However, provisioning applications in hybrid cloud/fog environment is still manual today. Existing PaaS do not support interacting with fog nodes, at the edge, for applications' components provisioning. This demo shows the key features of the hybrid Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) we have designed for IoT applications provisioning in cloud and fog environments. Three goals are assigned to the demo: (1) How applications can be designed and developed in such environments, (2) how the hybrid PaaS deploys the applications' components across cloud and fog nodes, and (3) how it executes and manages them using appropriate orchestration techniques.},

abstract={A progressive advancement in biosensors and wireless technology are the major contributors to the realization of continuous remote health monitoring system (RHMS). Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is part of this technology due to the deployment of multiple sensors such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) to collect vital body signals for processing and diagnosis. Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data. Generally, the presence of these problems in transmitting vital body signals may result in incorrect medical diagnosing which can increase mortality rate and cause severe impact to the overall system's performance. Thus, a suitable design of congestion control mechanism is urgently needed in designing a reliable and efficient remote health monitoring system.},

They first specify three design considerations for semi-automated tracking: data capture feasibility, the purpose of self-monitoring, and the motivation level.

This presented paper extends the underlying adaptive eHealth content management methodology to the coherent structural implementation of weighted majority voting algorithm. This cognitive human-machine interaction drives the targeted dynamically adaptive eHealth content management system in runtime mode. Telemedicine embraces information technology and telecommunication solutions for the sake of serving healthcare services at remote locations outside of the premises of classical medical institutions. These systems produce and process exponentially growing amount of sensory data. Moreover, they support real-time processing which requires a dynamically scalable and fault tolerant architecture. Utilizing cognitive services, the suitable methods determine the adequate system landscape delivering the suitable medical information from the collected body-sensory data. The underlying methodology utilizes correlation-data between different factors, thus invoking eHealth customizable cognitive content management system.

abstract={Over 125,000 Americans die annually from not taking medication properly. Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.},

Different with preceding studies that focus on saving patient information on the servers or improving access control, the proposed model considers threats related to process of patent information with efficiency. This study introduces a model where patients authorize representatives, who will be authenticated by hospitals, to transfer information to other hospitals safely for security, practicality, and efficiency. Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository. The advantage of this model is that it does not allow staff members or hospitals to collect information without patient's consent and thus reduces the risk of leaking patients' sensitive personal information to other places as the Token Repository saves nothing but the Access Token.},

abstract={A healthcare monitoring system is designed which can be used in the hospitals to monitor people who need to an intensive care. This system can be implemented on many biological signals. ECG signal is selected for put in practice in this work. Since ECG signal is measured in mille volt, it needs to be amplified. Also it is a noisy signal, so it needs to be filtered. ECG acquisition part contains AD620 Instrumentation Amplifier due to its low current noise. The network of patients nodes are require to be available in the intensive care room for measurement. A base node collects these many signals to be monitored in the nursing room. For wireless transmitreceive, nRF24L01+ wireless module is used. ATmega328 MCU in the Arduino Uno board is used in all node. LabVIEW software is programmed to display ECG signals as a waveform chart. For transferring ECG signals to the remote doctor, a Web Pager tool in the LabVIEW program is employed. So the remote doctor could be check his patients condition through internet. The system was implemented for three nodes.},

abstract={Various disruptive technologies have evolved a paradigm for setting up the Internet-of-Everything (IoE) and continuous evolution of technologies has demanded those devices to communicate and exchange information with each other. The marketing research company Gartner has surveyed and estimated that around 30 billion devices would be interconnected and exchanging information by 2020. The IoE is accompanied by several substantial opportunities in all fields of life, ranging from the energy sector to the healthcare industry. The trail of IoE development has opened new doors of attack vectors. The evolution in the plethora of ubiquitous devices has raised several insider threats, thus generating concerns of security and privacy within enterprises who have framed the use of smart devices through IoE. This paper discusses a different perspective of security and privacy issues in IoE by considering insiders bringing personal smart devices to use within the enterprise. The central theme of this research is to identify the challenges and explore the extent of security and privacy issues a global network of smart devices could exacerbate within the enterprise.},

abstract={Health care is the hardest real time constrained domain. Queuing system, Delay in treatment, Difficult to treat rural people, Disability to do remote treatment are the major issues in current health care system. Internet of Things (IoT) allows caring of people from remote locations with the help of integration of wireless sensor network with internet. Different sensors are used to measure different health parameters. Processing of smart health care data in an efficient manner is necessary. Slight time variation causes severe effect such as loss of life. In IoT, delay occur in processing large volume of sensor data in real time. Energy spent by the sensors also affected by processing delay. Because sensors spent energy in idle state. To reduce delay in processing smart health care data, Multi core technology is included with IoT. SixLoWPAN is the technique used to connect low configured devices with internet. In this paper, Task Level Parallelism (TLP) is applied to process different health parameters in parallel. TLP utilizes the available resources in optimal way. It makes our system as more efficient. The proposed system improves performance upto 65.5%. Efficient system also reduces power consumption of the devices. This will increase the life time of the sensor network.},

abstract={In recent years, the growing demand of personal healthcare has attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure. Using the model, diseases are ranked according to the current symptoms and stored in the server. Information of diseases and appropriate treatment therapies is sent back to the patient as well as stored in a web portal for personal monitoring.},

The article also presents an overview of two health-related data exchange standards from the western hemisphere, and gives a review with requirement specification on telemedicine systems interoperability. The applied health data exchange standards have significant impact on the general and widely interpreted interoperability of Telemedicine Systems. Interoperability for Telemedicine Systems can bring unprecedented value both at personal and at community level. In the other hand, the ability of sharing medical data on a global basis significantly extends the potential means of worldwide epidemic control. International disease analysis and the resulting forecasting-capabilities supported by Telemedicine Systems Interoperability represents a significant milestone in the practical application of various ICT-solutions, like cloud architecture, telecommunication systems, smart-devices and smartphone apps. Legacy healthcare systems, smartphone apps, smart-devices and telemedicine instruments are sharing data continuously and some of them are interdependent on each other. However, there are still significant barriers blocking the flawless circulation of medical information among health-institutions and devices. This paper also intends to explore some barriers on telemedicine systems interoperability and presents recommendation for future enhancement on flawless telemedicine data exchange.},

abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},

abstract={The recent advances in sensor/actuator and RFID technologies have spun out a new healthcare model enabling capture and dissemination of patient vital signs over the Internet for ubiquitous monitoring of these patients anytime and from anywhere. This provides new opportunities for enhancing healthcare through participatory consultation, medical diagnosis and many other novel healthcare services. Some of the advantages of this emerging technology referred to in this paper as “Cyber-healthcare” includes low acquisition cost, flexible deployment and improved accuracy resulting from replacing manual operations by fully digitized processes. It is expected that the emerging healthcare technology will change the way healthcare is delivered in both rural and urban settings of the developing world by building upon this technology to leapfrog from poorly prepared to medically equipped environments capable of tackling some of the most challenging medical issues of the developing world such as patients' vital signs capture, patient prioritization and preparedness to virus outbreaks such as Ebola. This paper proposes a Cyber-healthcare system as a first step towards the implementation of least cost digital health systems in the developing countries. We assess the field readiness of the off-the-shelf sensor technology used by the system and evaluate the performance of its underlying patient prioritization module using two machine learning algorithms: 1) multivariate linear regression and 2) support vector machine.},

We showed that the approach also critically improve the usability of the Smart Home. Finally, we described the methodology for analysis of the householder's behavior and simulation of his activities. So “offline” solutions based on this approach allows protecting privacy and provide good usability (“offline” means here partly or completely disconnected from the external operating signals and observations).

The idea of this project came so to reduce the headache of patient to visit to doctor every time he need to check his blood pressure, heart beat rate, temperature etc. With the help of this proposal the time of both patients and doctors are saved and doctors can also help in emergency scenario as much as possible. The proposed outcome of the project is to give proper and efficient medical services to patients by connecting and collecting data information through health status monitors which would include patient's heart rate, blood pressure and ECG and sends an emergency alert to patient's doctor with his current status and full medical information.},

abstract={Smart Cities are a key application domain for the Internet of Things (IoT), and it is coming nearer everyday through pilot trials and deployments in various cities around the world. In Porto, Portugal, a city-wide IoT Living Lab emerged after we deployed several testbeds, e.g. harbour and a city-scale vehicular networks, and carried out various experiments with the SenseMyCity crowdsensor. In this paper, we discuss how a standard Machine-to-Machine (M2M) middleware is a key enabler of our e-health platform and SenseMyCity crowdsensor, powered by the use of smartphones as M2M gateways. M2M standards provided by ETSI/oneM2M are essential for a paradigm shift, aiming at making the IoT truly interoperable without the need for human intervention. In this work, we map two applications that rely on the role of a smartphone as a gateway, which acts as a proxy to connect legacy devices to the IoT using a standard middleware. We illustrate the advantages of using M2M, and, as a proof-of-concept, we measure and quantify the energy savings obtained, showing improvements of smartphones' battery life.},

abstract={In remote healthcare monitoring and care delivery, obtaining the right information at the right time is critical. For these systems, designing an efficient MAC protocol that is able to meet the challenges on network quality such as throughput, latency, data reliability and energy saving is an imperative task. This paper presents a polymorphic, multi-behavioral MAC protocol called PEAM (Polymorphic, Energy-Aware MAC Protocol) designed to support WBANs used in ubiquitous healthcare monitoring systems. The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states. PEAM was designed based on cross-layer constructs that allow across the layers synchronization and coordination orchestrated by the application layer and targeting the Data link layer services. PEAM has also been enabled to interplay with IPv6 networks through interaction with the 6LowPAN middleware. This protocol was evaluated and compared to the well-known IEEE 802.15.4 standard using the network simulator OMNET++, and exhibited clear superiority.},

abstract={The ageing population worldwide is constantly rising, both in urban and regional areas. There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario. Finally, we conducted a scalability analysis to determine the feasibility of deploying IReHMo in large numbers in regions of north Sweden.},

In this regard, systems that can provide proactive health related alert would be beneficial. e-Health and telemedicine offer powerful tools to improve efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services. The focus of this paper is to design a low cost, reliable e-Health monitoring device using IoT based platform architecture that can measure the vital health parameters of an individual, securely store the data in server and analyze the data for generating proactive alerts as applicable. The platform also connects the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patients' health data. Vital health parameters are measured using simple, non-restricting electrical sensors. The platform has outlier detection capabilities and is designed to send alerts to patients and their respective doctors in case any anomaly occurs. Thus, the proposed solution can be used to provide clinical healthcare at a distance, hence enabling the inclusion of elderly or homebound patients and those who are located in the remotest corners of the country within the realm of healthcare services.},

abstract={An exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have been increasingly popular and they have been deployed in a wide range of areas including transportation system, healthcare, robotics, and smart home. Wireless sensor networks have facilitated our life using the remote sensing ability. However, these systems could be taken advantage by the malicious parties to mislead users since they are often not physically secured and are used in hostile environments. We have proposed theoretical and statistical framework for creating data integrity attacks and corresponding security defenses. The data integrity attack is defined as a type of attack that targets to mislead the system by altering some collected data of the system in such a way that to achieve the goal of attackers. We use the Intel lab sensor data and demonstrate that it is easy to attack only a few essential sensors values to change the behavior of system, such as the control of air conditioner. To be more specific, by changing the temperature and humidity data measured by a group of sensors, the attacker can control the air conditioner turning on and off without being detected by correlation check. On the top of data integrity attacks, we have further developed low overhead defense schemes.},

abstract={Cities increasingly face challenges related to pollution, efficient use of resources (e.g. water, energy) and ensuring a good quality of life for its citizens. Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives. A need for inter-continental automated testing facilities such as those developed by TRESCIMO is identified through which integrated experiments can be conducted to provide insight and answers.},

abstract={With the current progress in communication technology, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)s are extensively setup for plethora of applications such as defense, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare and many more. The limitation of sensor node is in terms of resources namely storage, power, processing potential and communication range. For the sensor network to be operational an efficient routing algorithm to forward the arriving packets is essential The data transferred by the nodes will be redundant in most of the scenarios. Selecting the optimal route for data transmission is one of the vital factors from the perspective view point of a routing protocol In order to eliminate the redundancy of data and to enhance the QoS parameters, Statistical Ad-hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (S-AODV) routing protocol is proposed in this paper. This new protocol is analyzed with respect to each layer by taking QoS metrics and statistical parameters in to consideration. A comparative study reveals that the proposed protocol performs better than the present AODV protocol.},

abstract={The high development of medicine causes the world's population aging quickly. To resolve the problem with limited medical resources, constant monitoring of elders' activity of daily living is important. We propose an activity recognition system for smart home, so elders can live alone and their children can monitor their parents' living activity to achieve the concept of "Aging in Place". The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past. We demonstrate the living activity monitoring model is feasible to be deployed in a living home with high accuracy performance of the activity recognition result.},

pages={466-469},
abstract={Diabetic ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},

abstract={With the emergence of IOT, WSNs have become prevalent for many application areas such as smart city scenario, healthcare, weather monitoring and intelligent transport system etc. Due to their smaller infrastructure and limited energy resources, these networks are considered to be controlled and lossy networks. IP mobility management in such networks playing a crucial role for object tracking or to provide uninterrupted services to mobile users. Existing MIPv6 and its extensions are not suitable for such lossy networks due to the MN's involvement in heavy signaling, required for HO. Network based protocol; PMIPv6 relieves the MN from heavy signaling overhead and being suggested by many researchers for lossy networks to carry out the mobility. But this protocol still suffers from extra signaling and packet loss and there is a scope for further improvements. This paper presents a novel approach based on PMIPv6 for reducing HO latency and packet loss for some critical applications such as Healthcare, battle field, disaster management, ITS etc. where packet loss is not acceptable. The performance analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is better than the standard PMIPv6.},

This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task.

We proposed this to implement anonymous light-weight authentication protocol through which a WBAN user can easily access the telemedicine system. Using WBAN services, the physicians receive the real-time information and updates of the patients. The Certificateless signature (CLS) scheme is probably used to uniquely meet the security demands in WBAN. With the help of CLS, the security is assigned by private keys given to the patient.

abstract={The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) in medical health care is bound to generate the massive volume of heterogeneous data due to the millions of medical sensors attached with various patients' body.

Therefore, to address such issues, we proposed Hadoop-based medical emergency management system using IoT technology, which involves a network architecture with the enhanced processing features for collecting data received from millions of medical sensors attached to the human body. The amount of collected data is then forwarded to the Intelligent Building to process and perform necessary actions using various units such as, collection unit, Hadoop Processing Unit (HPU), and Analysis and decision unit. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine.

pages={1-4},
abstract={This work proposes an ultralow power highly linear analog front-end (AFE) with an input dynamic range from 200μVpp to 20mVpp. The system consists of a signal conditioning instrumentation amplifier (IA), two programmable gain amplifiers (PGA), a mixed signal automatic gain control (AGC), two sample and hold (S/H), a 10 bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC), and a ΣΔ modulator with 10 bit effective number of bits (ENOB). A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32. The proposed system is intended to be powered by an energy scavenging circuit without compromising its own performance. The system was successfully tested for an ECG signal obtained from PTB database.},

abstract={The modelling of healthcare process is inherently complicated due to its multi-disciplinary character. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been considered and applied to model and demonstrate the flexibility and variability of the activities that involved in healthcare process. However, with the growing usage of digital information and IoT technology in the healthcare system, the issue of information security and privacy becomes the main concern in term of both store and management of electronic health record (EHR). Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place. BPMN is lacking of the ability to model and present security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a suitable way. This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult. In this paper we provide a solution to model the security concepts in BPMN by extending it with new designed security elements, which can be integrated with the BPMN diagram smoothly.},

abstract={Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.},

abstract={This paper presents a design of an indoor localization system that can be used in hospital nurse calling systems. The call button of patient is batteryless and wireless. The positioning system is developed for this batteryless button. When the switch is pressed, a wireless telegram is sent to reference nodes that act like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This wireless message contains the module ID and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value. The reference nodes or beacons forward the information gathered from target node to a central receiver attached to a computer. A program is developed to read the incoming signals to the receiver module for processing. This program calculate the distance between target node (unknown location) and each reference node (known location), and then it determines the position of the call button which held by the patient. In parallel, nurses hold smart phones, and the position is determined via WiFi-Based Positioning System (WPS). Both systems are combined and linked to the nurse calling system.

abstract={These last years developed countries and specially European countries are characterized by aging population and economical crisis, as a consequence, the funds dedicated to social services has been diminished specially those dedicated to healthcare, is then desirable to optimize the costs of public and private healthcare systems reducing the affluence of chronic and dependant people to care centers and enabling the management of chronic diseases outside institutions. It is necessary to streamline the health system resources leading to the development of new medical services based on telemedicine and biomedical sensors. New health applications based on remote monitoring will significantly increasing the volume of health information to store, manage and analyze, including heterogeneous data coming from medical records and biomedical sensors. The Big Data and IoT concepts and techniques offer an integrated approach to develop a suitable architecture for an adequate treatment of this kind of information.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources. In this paper we report on developments made to-date in various technical areas with respect to critical issues such as cost, power consumption, scalability, interoperability and privacy.},

abstract={With the pervasiveness of smartphones and the advance of wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs), mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) has attracted considerable interest recently. In m-Healthcare, users' smartphones serve as bridges connecting their WBSNs and the healthcare center (HCC), i.e., send users' personal health information (PHI) collected by WBSNs to the HCC and receive the feedback. However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can realize privacy-preservation and achieve secure end-to-end communication for m-healthcare, and is suitable for resource-limited WBSNs.},

abstract={The cost and effort for developing personal healthcare systems with IoT devices can be substantially high mainly due to complex inference capabilities. To tackle the problems, we proposed INFerence-as-a-Service (INFaaS) in our previous work. INFaaS is a cloud service which provides a core set of common functionality required to develop various context-aware applications. Since INFaaS is designed for generic purpose, its applicability and genericity should be verified in that sense. In this paper, we present a comprehensive case study of developing an IoT-based Personal Healthcare System with the INFaaS cloud framework. This system requires various inference algorithms to diagnose diseases with the acquired medical contexts, which will increase developers' overhead. We believe that a cloud service providing inference services such as INFaaS yields a tremendous benefits in terms of cost benefits.},

abstract={With increased in digitization the amount of homogeneous, unstructured, semi-structured, structured or heterogeneous data being created and stored is exploding is collectively called “Dataspace”. Data being generated from various heterogeneous sources like, digital images, audio, video, online transactions, online social media, data from sensor nodes, click streams for different domains including, retails, medical, healthcare, energy, and day to day life utilities. In business, industries, institutions and organizations, individuals contribute the data volume like technical reports, seminar reports, research papers, dissertations, thesis etc. For instance, 30 billion web pages are accessed or the World Wide Web. With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms. In this we also explained how ranking can be used in Dataspace with challenges to information retrieval from heterogeneous data or from Dataspace.},

Most approaches address specific healthcare concerns, which typically result in solutions that aren't able to support full-scale sensing and data analysis for a more generic healthcare service, but the approach in this article differs from seamlessly linking multimodel data-collecting infrastructure and data analytics together in an AAL platform.

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers.},

abstract={As the population is increasing worldwide, huge need arises to provide proper health-care services. With the advent of modern technologies the need-gap may be augmented. Sensor is one such technology which can be used to enable Internet of Things based health-care monitoring system. In this paper, implementation of such a system is described. In a real time health monitoring system, there are many sensors connected to a local data processing unit through a shared channel having a fixed bandwidth. These sensors have a wide variety of channel access requirements. The access to the channel should be discrete, so that each and every sensor avails the required bandwidth and delay in the shared channel. In this paper, a scheduling technique is proposed for the IoT based system, which nullify interference among different sensors and consequent distortation of precious health data. Implementation of this technique in our prototype health-care monitoring application is discussed in this paper.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Nanotechnology is providing a new set of tools to design and manufacture miniaturized devices such as sensors or on/off chips networks. Such devices require wireless communications for information sharing and coordination. Unfortunately, reducing the size of a classical metallic antenna down to a few micrometres would impose the use of very high resonant frequencies, from the near infrared to the optical ranges (tens of hundreds of THz). This would drastically limit their communication range and require the implementation of transceivers able to operate at this extremely high frequency. Graphene offers a new approach to radically downscale antennas thanks to its ability to support the propagation of Surface-Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in the terahertz frequency band.

abstract={We present an approach that combines semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool to enable the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users. In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning. Possible applications of the presented system include the configuration of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},

abstract={While innovative e-Health and m-Health technologies and solutions will eventually change the way health and social care are delivered, it raises many challenges regarding what sort of ethical concerns need to be addressed in order to provide imperative regulations and guidance to healthcare professionals and developers. This paper discusses key ethical challenges identified as part of an ongoing research project funded under the European Commission's Future Internet-Private Public Partnership (FI-PPP) initiative. The Future Internet Social Technological Alignment Research project (FI-STAR) is concerned with the validation of Future Internet technology developed under earlier FI-PPP projects and involves seven early trials in the healthcare domain. The project is supported by 26 European partners with a further extension of 10 partners or so pending. The challenges discussed in this paper include ethical-legal frameworks, privacy and international harmonization. The suggestions discussed in this paper include an overarching e-Health ethical framework, an ethical impact assessment and an ethical matrix. The ethical matrix can be used as a tool to illuminate the diverse requirements among the seven uses cases and to narrow down potential strategies to address the ethical challenges.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are capable of observing the environment, processing data, and making decisions based on these observations. They have high potential impacts in many fields, including: education, healthcare, monitoring, retail, and science. Wireless sensor networks are composed of a large number of sensor nodes with limited energy resources. There is a need to design protocols that adapt much better to the constraints of the sensor network environment. I propose a protocol called Large Scale Environmental Monitoring and Maintaining Sensing Coverage in Sensor Networks. When an event is expected to occur in an area, the application requires a minimum percentage of sensor coverage. Since the sensor nodes are deployed randomly in the sensing field, it may consist of sensor nodes with overlapping coverage areas providing redundant data. It would be desirable to save energy in some sensor nodes by allowing them to sleep, when sensor node is covered by the neighbors of sensor nodes.},

abstract={Massive medical and health care data has been generated, asking for research and development of cloud storage system. In order to improve its scalability and reliability at the same time shorten user access time, the multiple data replica scheme should be adopted and the proper location for each replica should be determined. In this paper, a multiple data replica placement scheme for cloud storage under health-care IoT environment is proposed. It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica. We have implemented the proposed scheme based on CloudSim and have done performance evaluation. Simulation results have shown that it can not only improve user access time and promote load balance but also enhance system scalability and reliability.},

However, the high heterogeneity of sensor networks poses a great challenge in interoperability and cooperative work, and the building of technological bridges among wireless sensor network (WSN) islands is more and more a must for smart cities for an efficient operation. In this paper, we present a model for an Area Sensor Network (ASN) that combines and connects small networks (Body Sensor Networks), WSNs and even fixed sensor networks within a particular area of interest. Initial tests show that the combination of sensed data from multiple sources (sensor networks) produces synergetic services useful for smart cities.},

abstract={With the advent of Smart City, quality of life is bound to be better. But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option. In this paper, a fuzzy assisted data gathering and alert scheme is proposed for healthcare services. Thus unnecessary waste of energy by transmission of unnecessary information is avoided. We have implemented it using Arduino and eHealth sensor kit.},

abstract={Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication has emerged as a key technology with huge market potential for cellular service providers deploying LTE networks. Addition of enormous number of M2M devices into the cellular networks poses a heavy competition to existing Human-to-Human (H2H) devices for getting radio resources, thereby affecting the performance of the H2H communications. But, one can not treat all M2M flows as low priority and schedule them after H2H flows, as there are many M2M applications like healthcare and tracking which are of high importance and delay-intolerant. Hence, there is a need for class based priority scheduling of the traffic of M2M and H2H sessions in the network. In this paper, we propose a class based dynamic priority scheduling algorithm for uplink transmission of M2M and H2H traffic in LTE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by various metrics such as H2H throughput and system throughput and also compared with existing schedulers.},

abstract={Robotic applications are becoming ubiquitous. They are widely used in several areas (e.g., healthcare, disaster management, and manufacturing). However, their provisioning still faces several challenges such as cost and resource usage efficiency. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that may aid in tackling these challenges. It has three main facets: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper focuses on the IaaS aspects of robotic applications as cloud computing services. It proposes an architecture that enables cost efficiency through virtualization and dynamic task delegation to robots, including robots that might belong to other clouds. Overlays and RESTful Web services are used as cornerstones. A prototype is built using LEGO Mindstorms NXT as the robotic platform, and JXTA as the overlay middleware. Related work is reviewed, the functional entities and interfaces of the architecture are described, and the prototype architecture is presented along with the implemented scenario.},

abstract={Multi-Sensory mobile health monitoring systems promise substantial improvements in the quality of healthcare. However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},

In this paper, we propose a new e-Health platform driven by the needs of integrated diabetes care management. Architecture of this platform that is designed to be consistent with the concepts of Web-of-Things (WoT) comprises a physical sensors layer linked to a health Web-portal layer via an existing network infrastructure. The physical layer incorporates wireless nodes; each of which comprises a set of medical sensors linked wirelessly to a humanoid robot. Unlike existing e-Health systems, the proposed system is designed to support self-management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) not only through remote data collection and monitoring of patients data, but also through offering a support platform for real-time decisions and long-term social and behavioral change. These support services are delivered to the patients over a distance through daily patient-robot interactions that are either automatically generated be the system or assigned by specialist physicians. A prototype e-health platform which incorporates all these healthcare attributes is designed, implemented, and its end-to-end functionality is tested successfully with the aid of NHS collaborators.},

abstract={Over one billion smartphones have now been shipped worldwide. These mobile devices feature multi-core CPUs and GPUs, megapixel cameras and an array of sensors. Smartphone sensors can now be processed to diagnose a wide variety of medical conditions including cough detection, irregular heartbeat detection, and lung function analysis. The ability to diagnose ailments in the convenience of patients' homes on smartphones that they already possess could lead to early detection, which could ultimately reduce healthcare costs. This paper reviews state-of-the-art examples, examines the technical issues involved in the use of the smartphone as a medical device, and outlines potential benefits and challenges. A case study of an Android smartphone app for wound detection and healing progress analysis by diabetes patients is also presented.},

abstract={IPv6 Low-power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) have recently found renewed interest because of the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT).However, mobility support in 6LoWPANs is still in its infancy for large-scale IP-based sensor technology in future IoT. The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Our initial numerical results show a reduction of the handoff costs on the mobile router which normally constitute a bottleneck in such a system. We also discuss important metrics such as signaling overload, bandwidth efficiency and power consumption and how they can be optimized through the mobility management.},

abstract={With the popularity of Internet of Things, the next logical step will focus on the application layer on top of network connectivity, especially Web of Things. While most of the existing efforts on Web of Things are focused on device mash up and data collection, in this paper a semantic web of things framework is proposed to leverage Semantic Web as the unified mechanism for monitoring, tasking, presentation, information flow and collaboration. Firstly, the requirements of human centric web of things application are described. Then the active linked data with data, task, context, computational organization, knowledge, presentation and interaction models is defined by extending the conventional linked data. Based on the active linked data models, we propose a semantic Web of Things framework, which leverages multiagent technologies to facilitate human-to-human and human-to-machine collaborations. Finally, a sample case on care coordination and ubiquitous health service roaming is given. This paper demonstrates how these technologies and architectures significantly enhance the capability of Web of Things for human centric applications.},

abstract={We present an Adaptive Beaconing Medium Access Control (AB-MAC) protocol based on time division multiple access (TDMA) in order to provide healthcare services. The purpose of our protocol is to gain not only energy-efficiency but also provide low delivery latency when both periodic data and event-driven data are present. In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose standby slots that are deployed during each beacon interval. The standby slots are able to identify unscheduled data with low delivery latency. An adaptive beacon is then provided that quickly reschedules the time slots. Furthermore, the AB-MAC asymmetrically assigns energy consumption to a hub instead of the sensor nodes when possible in order to reduce node's energy waste. In this paper, we evaluate IEEE 802.15.4 and AB-MAC in energy consumption and delivery latency. The simulation results indicate that the AB-MAC outperforms than IEEE 802.15.4 in BSNs.},

With the diversification of terminals and development of internet technology, internet technology has come into the stage of Next Generation Network(NGN) technology. Comparing with the current Internet technology that provides services in the imaginary space, the technology on Internet of Things (IOT) is based on real word. It links things together via sensors and wireless communication technology to collect a variety of information on the condition of people and their surrounding space in the real world. The combination of Internet technology and Technology on IOT integrates physical world and imaginary space on a shared platform to eliminate the constraints of imaginary space and provide intricate, diverse, and advanced services focusing on people, which have not been achieved [1].

abstract={Nowadays the use of smart phones gets more and more widespread in the whole world. How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.},

abstract={In the last decade, the seminal term and concept of “m-health” were first defined and introduced in this transactions as “mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for healthcare.” Since that special section, the m-health concept has become one of the key technological domains that reflected the key advances in remote healthcare and e-health systems. The m-health is currently bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare delivery and technology sectors. From the wireless communications perspective, the current decade is expected to bring the introduction of new wireless standards and network systems with true mobile broadband and fast internet access healthcare services. These will be developed around what is currently called the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. In this editorial paper, we will introduce the new and novel concept of 4G health that represents the long-term evolution of m-health since the introduction of the concept in 2004. The special section also presents a snapshot of the recent advances in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the evolved m-health perspective. It will also present some of the concepts that can go beyond the traditional “m-health ecosystem” of the existing systems. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging healthcare delivery concept.},

abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},
