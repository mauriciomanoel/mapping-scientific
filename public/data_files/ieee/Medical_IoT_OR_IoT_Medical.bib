abstract={A number of governmental and non-governmental bodies are visiting the rural parts of India on a regular basis to provide quality health care facilities. But due to the remoteness of the areas, the follow up of patients has become a major challenge. In this work we propose an Internet of things based patient health monitoring system as a solution to afore mentioned problem. The system monitors vital health parameters of a patient and uploads the data to server using a software based gateway. The data is processed real-time and doctor is alerted when anomalies are detected. There is provision for bi-directional data flow, allowing the doctor to send clinical advice to the patient. The system was tested in a rural healthcare unit and real-time data was generated. The results were confirmed by qualified medical practitioner.},

abstract={Healthcare is beginning to embrace point of care (POC) diagnostics and medical applications that are based on the internet of things (IoT) and the ubiquitous smart phone. Advanced medical diagnostics will utilize biosensors for biological data acquisition. This paper introduces the forecasting of biosensors that have the potential to be used in POC and IoT applications. For this research three types of biosensors were selected. These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively. Bibliometrics with annual publication count did not appear to provide much value in forecasting the maturity growth of the three biosensors.},

abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming a reality, power-efficient techniques are crucial to achieve sufficient battery lifetimes. Whereas current medical IoT devices typically acquire data with a constant quality, we propose an architecture that dynamically adjusts the data quality adaptively based on the current medical condition of the subject being monitored. Since transmission and processing make up a large fraction of the energy consumption, the reduction of the link traffic and processing effort caused by such an adjustment results in a decreased energy consumption of the devices. For example, if anomalies in the monitored data are detected, the monitoring is performed with an increased granularity and more exhaustive processing. Further, not all data generated by the medical sensors needs to be transmitted during all times. Only if certain events are detected, the transmission of the complete data needs to be activated. In this paper, we present a novel approach for body-worn medical IoT devices. In particular, a generic, distributed architecture for the power-management of the whole system, which is based on dynamically switching services, is presented. We show that such an architecture can reduce the energy-consumption of medical sensors by up to 80 % in real-world measurements.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT), our surrounding will include a large variety of devices from different manufacturers. One of its promising branches, the medical IoT, will also be accompanied by heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures. However, the efficacy of a medical IoT application will depend on how well the surrounding smart devices collaborate with it to serve the individual needs of the users. Pre-programmed solutions lack flexibility to adapt to each need and environment, and fail to make full use of the capabilities of a set of smart devices. In this paper, we propose a concept based on the flexible and user-friendly synthesis and switching of services for medical IoT applications. The crux of the concept is to provide a methodology in which non-experts can dynamically define services based on their needs. We describe a potential scenario, discuss the associated challenges, and present preliminary results on the feasibility of this approach. Particularly, we focus on design aspects for realizing the concept and propose the use of interpreters on the smart devices as alternative solution. We show that such an approach is feasible in terms of implementation and energy consumption while still maintaining the full flexibility of the service synthesis.},

abstract={This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading from medical cloud storage to medical Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The medical cloud can distribute its own medical data to medical IoT devices via access points. Therefore, network disconnection can happen between the medical cloud and medical IoT devices when power/energy management in each access point is not efficient. This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance.},

abstract={Epilepsy is a common neural disorder disease, while difficult to cure. There is still a risk of suffering from seizures even though patients have used antiepileptic drugs or had an operation. In such cases, patients must be immediately taken care; on the other hand, how to avoid introducing danger to their family and people around is also a concern. To address this issue, we integrate and develop a health cloud system to detect, record, and further predict epileptic seizure, which includes a dedicated wearable device for detection, a medical-IoT box to avoid heavy computation on the wearable device and provide cross reference to cameras, a cloud computing platform for complex computation, and an application on tablets for health care professionals. We propose a reactive and highly programmable model for such a system to allow health care professionals to easily and quickly query data from different devices and customize the trigger conditions, while optimize computing resource to achieve power saving on devices. We base this research on reactive programming (RP), which recently attracts the interests of researchers and developers, to construct our model, and develop a domain-specific language (DSL) that is applied among the medical-IoT box, cloud computing, and user interface for health care professionals. Such a DSL must be easy-to-write since health care professionals are not necessarily experts in programming, but it must also be powerful enough to allow them to query the logging data, analyze the interaction between different devices, and further configure the setting of devices for individual patients to benefit from our platform. At the same time, it automatically optimizes the communication and computation based the trigger conditions to achieve power saving on devices.},

IoT consists of communications and sensors to accomplish purpose. In the diverse kinds of networks, wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN construction scheme that is consists of 4 operations, the clustered topology setup, mobility support, and transmission efficiency enhancement. As an auxiliary benefit, the proposed scheme achieves an energy efficient feature by reducing the number of total control messages. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed scheme remarkably improves the performance of WBAN.},

Some medical IoT sensors translate and receive the massive data every time and on the other hand some equipment just translate emergency signal for help calling. All these communication process should be treated separately to keep the efficiency of ISM band utility.

The performance of the protocols was evaluated using a network emulator, allowing us to emulate a low bandwidth, high system latency, and high packet loss wireless access network. This paper reports the observed performance of the protocols and arrives at the conclusion that although DDS results in higher bandwidth usage than MQTT, its superior performance with regard to data latency and reliability makes it an attractive choice for medical IoT applications and beyond.},

Governments encourage smart city initiatives to explore its applications. To determine knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare institutions toward IoT applications it is very important to objectively understand effects, to systematically summarize experiences, risks and barriers, to suggest market- oriented requirements, and to provide inspiration and reference for future smart city initiatives. Methods: We designed a KAP questionnaire about the IoT for healthcare and conducted a survey among municipal hospitals in Wuxi, China in May, 2015. Results: All respondents agreed on the definition of IoT for healthcare and easily obtained knowledge about the new IoT technology. Respondents showed positive views towards valuable functions and preferred solutions with inventory or material tracking, identification and authentication to make healthcare services more effective, convenient, and safe. We have stated that it is critical to solve security, privacy, and standardization issues. Last but not least, we have observed that governmental investments had played a guiding role and promoted IoT applications. Conclusions: The pilot survey has provided important insights into the KAP of IoT applications for healthcare institutions.

abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},
